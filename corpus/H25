H25 0010  1    The one- or two-season hunt, of which there have been
H25 0010 13    too many recently, may do more harm than good; for
H25 0020  8    such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving
H25 0030  3    excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed
H25 0040  3    when the programs are discontinued; and they are dashed,
H25 0050  1    no less, by lack of skill in making selections of men
H25 0050 12    and women for development toward the highest reaches
H25 0060  5    of the mind and spirit.
H25 0060 10       For the making of selections on the basis of excellence
H25 0070 10    requires that any foundation making the selections
H25 0080  5    shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors
H25 0090  6    whose judgments are known to be good: such judgments
H25 0100  1    can be known to be good only by the records of those
H25 0100 13    selected, by records made subsequent to their selection
H25 0110  8    over considerable periods of time.
H25 0120  3       The central group of the Foundation's advisors are,
H25 0130  2    at any one period of time, the members of our Advisory
H25 0130 13    Board, consisting, now, of thirty-six men and women.
H25 0140  9    They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees
H25 0150  5    on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments
H25 0160  2    in their different fields of scholarship and the arts.
H25 0170  1    Their locations in all parts of the United States,
H25 0170 10    and their locations in the several kinds of educational
H25 0180  7    and research institutions that are the principal homes
H25 0190  6    of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are
H25 0200  3    factors in the Trustees' minds. For this concept of
H25 0200 12    an Advisory Board, ancillary to the Board of Trustees,
H25 0210  9    we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University,
H25 0220  8    A. Lawrence Lowell, a master of the subject of the
H25 0230  8    structure of cultural institutions and their administration.
H25 0240  4    That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's
H25 0250  2    concept and make it the base for our processes of selection
H25 0260  1    is one reason why our selections have been, it may
H25 0260 11    be said truly, pretty uniformly good.
H25 0270  4       For in accordance with Mr. Lowell's concept of an
H25 0280  4    advisory board, our selections are made by experienced
H25 0290  1    selectors who give both constancy and consistency to
H25 0290  9    our processes and our choices. And lest we should become
H25 0300  9    too consistent, in the sense of becoming heedless of
H25 0310  6    new fields of scholarship and new points of view in
H25 0320  4    the arts, the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains
H25 0330  1    a trickle- not a flow!- of new members through the
H25 0330 11    Advisory Board.
H25 0340  1       Two committees of members of the Advisory Board
H25 0340  9    constitute the committees of selection- one for the
H25 0350  8    selection of Fellows from Canada, the United States,
H25 0360  6    and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for
H25 0370  5    the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics
H25 0380  2    and the Republic of the Philippines.
H25 0380  8       To the members of our Advisory Board, and most specially
H25 0390  8    to its members who constitute our committees of selection,
H25 0400  5    the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice
H25 0410  4    of Fellows. We are, as we know, utterly dependent on
H25 0420  2    the quality of advice we get; and quality of advice,
H25 0420 12    added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and
H25 0430  7    ideals, we do get from our Advisory Board in measures
H25 0440  6    so full that they can be appreciated only by those
H25 0450  4    of us who work here every day.
H25 0450 11       But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members'
H25 0460  7    duties are only one of several sets of facts about
H25 0470  5    the quest for advice, both reliable and imaginative,
H25 0480  1    on which to base our selections of Fellows. For example,
H25 0480 11    the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory
H25 0490  9    Board remains such that they place their knowledge
H25 0500  7    and judgments at our disposal much as they had done
H25 0510  6    when they were, formally, members of that Board. And,
H25 0520  2    besides, there are a large number of scholars, artists,
H25 0520 11    composers of music, novelists, poets, essayists, choreographers,
H25 0530  7    lawyers, servants of government, and men of affairs-
H25 0540  7    hundreds, indeed- who serve the Foundation well with
H25 0550  5    the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their
H25 0560  4    experience.
H25 0560  5       To all, the Foundation gives the kind of thanks
H25 0570  3    which are more than thanks: to them we are grateful
H25 0570 13    beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful
H25 0580  9    we are.

H25 0590  1    IT IS a truism of business that no business can be
H25 0590 12    better than its board of directors and its top management.
H25 0600  9    The same is true of every foundation. During the biennium
H25 0610  6    reviewed in this Report, our Board of Trustees named
H25 0620  5    able men, younger than the rest of us, to the Board
H25 0630  2    and to top management to insure future continuance
H25 0630 10    of the first-class administration of the Foundation's
H25 0640  5    affairs:
H25 0640  6       Dr. James Brown Fisk, physicist, President of the
H25 0650  8    Bell Telephone Laboratories, was elected to the Board
H25 0660  6    of Trustees. He is a member both of the National Academy
H25 0670  6    of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society;
H25 0680  2    and he has served our country well as a scientific
H25 0690  1    statesman on international commissions.
H25 0690  5       Dr. Gordon N. Ray, Provost, Vice-President and Professor
H25 0700  7    of English in the University of Illinois, was appointed
H25 0710  5    Associate Secretary General. The Trustees of the Foundation
H25 0720  6    appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated
H25 0730  4    expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary
H25 0740  1    General upon the latter's eventual retirement. Dr.
H25 0740  8    Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation- appointed thrice
H25 0750  8    to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray
H25 0760  5    and of H. G. Wells- and, before his appointment to
H25 0770  5    the Foundation's executive staff, had been given our
H25 0780  3    highest scholarly accolade, appointment to the Advisory
H25 0780 10    Board.
H25 0790  1       Referring further to the Foundation's officers,
H25 0790  7    Dr. James F. Mathias, for eleven years our discerning
H25 0800  9    colleague as Associate Secretary, was promoted to be
H25 0810  7    Secretary. He is a historian, with the great merit
H25 0820  5    of a historian's long view.
H25 0820 10       Also appointed to the Foundation's staff, as Assistant
H25 0830  7    Secretary, is Mr. J. Kellum Smith, Jr. Mr. Smith,
H25 0840  7    like the present Secretary General, is a lawyer; and
H25 0850  6    lawyers- with the great virtues that they are trained
H25 0860  5    to read "the fine print" carefully and are able out
H25 0870  3    of professional experience to arrive at imaginative
H25 0870 10    solutions to difficult problems in many fields- are
H25 0880  8    indispensable even in a foundation office.
H25 0890  2       The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's
H25 0900  2    principal administrative officer continuously since
H25 0900  7    the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago.
H25 0910  7    But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted
H25 0920  8    new arrangements are, quite simply, made to assure
H25 0930  5    qualitative continuity in the Foundation's policies
H25 0940  2    and practices. The effective recognition of excellence
H25 0940  9    and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned
H25 0950 11    in a day, nor even in a year.

H25 0960  5    WE ARE not given to lamentations, neither personally
H25 0970  1    nor in these Reports. On the contrary, if this be an
H25 0970 12    apocalyptic era as is commonly said, we see it as an
H25 0980 11    era of opportunity. For, granting that there are great
H25 0990  6    present-day problems to be solved, these problems make
H25 1000  3    great demands; and by their demanding tend to create
H25 1010  1    resources of men's minds and hearts which problems
H25 1010  9    with easy answers do not bring forth. Of this, examples
H25 1020  8    are legion: Pericles speaking his funeral oration in
H25 1030  5    Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making
H25 1040  3    it a testament of freedom; Jefferson writing the Declaration
H25 1050  2    of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution;
H25 1060  1    Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount, close to
H25 1060 10    his ultimate sacrifice; Shakespeare speaking with "the
H25 1070  5    indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice"- Keats's
H25 1080  4    words- in the days of the Spanish Armada's threats;
H25 1090  3    Isaac Newton, at the age of twenty-three, industriously
H25 1110  2    calculating logarithms "to two and fifty places" during
H25 1120  1    the great plague year in England, 1665; Winston Churchill's
H25 1130  1    Olympian, optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain
H25 1130  8    stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less
H25 1140  8    than twenty years ago; the present-day explorations
H25 1150  4    of outer space, answering age-old questions of science
H25 1160  3    and philosophy, in the face of possible wars of extinction.
H25 1170  1       Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit, as the Roman
H25 1170 10    poet, Virgil, declared with much more historical sense
H25 1180  8    than most writers of today. It gives, indeed, cause
H25 1190  7    for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of
H25 1200  3    the past produced; and it is to be noted also that
H25 1210  1    confidence should grow from remembering that great
H25 1210  8    men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe
H25 1220  8    into future good for all mankind.
H25 1230  1       For example, out of the social evils of the English
H25 1230 11    industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens;
H25 1240  8    and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions
H25 1250  7    of those evils for all Western men- until today-, in
H25 1260  6    the industrialized West, these social evils substantially
H25 1270  2    do not exist. The solutions were not arrived at by
H25 1270 12    any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men
H25 1280 10    of government- lawyers, most of them- and men of business.
H25 1290  8    These were educated men, who, as Mr. Justice Holmes
H25 1300  6    was fond of saying, formed their inductions out of
H25 1310  3    experience under the burden of responsibility. That
H25 1310 10    is, to put it realistically, they had to run their
H25 1320 10    businesses at a profit, or they had to get the votes
H25 1330  8    to get elected. Nevertheless, they made naught of Marx's
H25 1340  4    prophecy that capitalism would never pay the "workers"-
H25 1350  3    to use Marx's word- more than a subsistence wage, with
H25 1360  1    the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably
H25 1360  8    find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the
H25 1370  8    result, in turn, that the gap between the rich and
H25 1380  6    the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of
H25 1390  2    the poor increase.
H25 1390  5       But as all understand who have eyes to see, nothing
H25 1400  4    of the kind has happened; indeed, the contrary has
H25 1410  1    happened. The gulf between the "rich" and the "poor"
H25 1410 10    has narrowed, in the industrialized Western world,
H25 1420  6    to the point that the word "poor" is hardly applicable.
H25 1430  5    And the reason this could happen is clear: men of government,
H25 1440  5    business men, lawyers and all who concerned themselves
H25 1450  2    with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their
H25 1460  1    concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict
H25 1460 10    the development of freedom and opportunity. Some would
H25 1470  6    say that they were not permitted to run their businesses
H25 1480  5    only for profit; and even putting it that way would
H25 1490  3    not prove that Marx was anything but wrong.
H25 1490 11       Sir Henry Sumner Maine, a hundred years before Communism
H25 1500  8    was a force to be reckoned with, wrote his brilliant
H25 1510  6    legal generalization, that "the progress of society
H25 1520  4    is from status to contract". The essence of contract
H25 1530  1    is that one is free to make a choice of what one will
H25 1530 14    or will not do. Hence, the condition of freedom is
H25 1540  8    a necessary condition for choice. The greater the range
H25 1550  5    of freedom for individual men, the greater the range
H25 1560  3    of choice; the greater the range of choice, the greater
H25 1570  1    the rate of change. For change is dependent on the
H25 1570 11    possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future.
H25 1580  7    But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose,
H25 1590  5    men- individual men- must remain in status and society
H25 1600  3    does not, cannot progress.
H25 1600  7       The eternal truth is that progress- due, as it always
H25 1610  8    is, to individual creative genius- is just as dependent
H25 1620  7    on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating
H25 1630  2    of the heart.
H25 1630  5       And lest anybody think that considerations such
H25 1640  2    as these are not germane in a foundation report, let
H25 1640 12    me enlighten them with the truths that, under Communism
H25 1650  8    there would have been no capital with which to endow
H25 1660  7    the Foundation, and that there would not be that individual
H25 1670  5    freedom within which the Fellows might proceed, untrammeled
H25 1680  2    in every way, toward their discoveries, their creative
H25 1690  1    efforts for the good of mankind.

H25 1690  8    DURING the year 1959, we granted 354 Fellowships; in
H25 1700  6    1960, we granted 334. As heretofore, our Fellowships
H25 1710  3    are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge
H25 1720  2    and creative effort in all the arts. We do not favor
H25 1720 13    one field over another: we think that all inquiry,
H25 1730  8    all scholarly and artistic creation, is good- provided
H25 1740  5    only that it contributes to a sense and understanding
H25 1750  3    of the true ends of life, as all first-rate scholarship
H25 1760  1    and artistic creation does. Indeed, if pressed, we
H25 1760  9    would say what the late Robert Henri, American painter,
H25 1770  7    said to a pupil, "Anything will do for a subject: it's
H25 1780  7    what you do with it that counts".
H25 1790  1       Thus, we have no part, and want none, in current
H25 1790 11    discussions of the relative importance of science,
H25 1800  7    the social studies, the humanities, the creative arts.
H25 1810  4    We want no part in such discussions, because we think
H25 1820  3    them largely futile; and we think them largely futile
H25 1820 12    because, for true excellence of accomplishment, every
H25 1830  7    scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge
H25 1840  7    and boundaries of points of view.
