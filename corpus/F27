F27 0010  1       EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always
F27 0010 10    an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii
F27 0020  6    with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world
F27 0030  7    are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper or negociant
F27 0040  3    who in turn supplies him. In instances where both of
F27 0050  3    these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation
F27 0050 12    is ideal. It may, on occasion, be anything but that.
F27 0060  9    However, by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting
F27 0070  6    his advice, one will soon enough ascertain whether
F27 0080  2    he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he
F27 0080 13    may have been told by salesmen and promoters) and,
F27 0090  9    better yet, whether he has a taste for wine. Again,
F27 0100  7    by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers,
F27 0110  3    one becomes familiar with the names and specialties
F27 0120  1    of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This
F27 0120  9    is important because, despite all the efforts of the
F27 0130  7    French government, an appreciable segment of France's
F27 0140  4    export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation
F27 0150  2    approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many
F27 0160  1    too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than
F27 0160 11    amass a creditable reputation overseas.
F27 0170  4       A good negociant or shipper will not only be the
F27 0180  6    man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the
F27 0190  2    best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also
F27 0190 13    be the one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound
F27 0200 10    wines from vineyards generally in his own district.
F27 0210  6    These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday
F27 0220  4    drinking, for even in France virtually no one drinks
F27 0230  2    the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis. The Grands
F27 0240  1    Crus are expensive, and even doting palates tire of
F27 0240 10    them. And certainly, in the case of the beginner or
F27 0250  8    the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker, the palate
F27 0260  4    and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready
F27 0270  1    for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent
F27 0270 11    recourse to crus of less renown. There is nothing infra
F27 0280 10    dig about a good blend from a good shipper. Some of
F27 0290  9    them are very delicious indeed, and there are many
F27 0300  5    good ones exported- unfortunately, along with others
F27 0310  2    not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable
F27 0310 11    wine dealer and constant experimentation- "steering
F27 0320  5    ever from the known to the unknown"- are the requisites.
F27 0330  6       Wine waiters are something else again; especially
F27 0340  4    if one is travelling or dining out a great deal, their
F27 0350  3    importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate
F27 0360  1    on the same principle by which justice is administered
F27 0360 10    in France and some other Latin countries: the customer
F27 0370  7    is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until
F27 0380  5    proven otherwise, with the burden of proof on the customer
F27 0390  4    himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!)
F27 0400  1    is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly,
F27 0400 11    if everyone in the world who could afford the best
F27 0410  9    wines also liked them, the supply would dry up in no
F27 0420  7    time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating,
F27 0430  1    argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible
F27 0440  1    attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine
F27 0440 11    waiter is, paradoxically, the guardian (and not the
F27 0450  7    purveyor) of his cellar against the Visigoths. Faced,
F27 0460  4    on the one hand, with an always exhaustible supply
F27 0470  2    of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele
F27 0470 13    usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it
F27 0480  5    is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted
F27 0490  5    with chronic ambivalence. The one way to get around
F27 0500  3    them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking
F27 0510  1    to it- is to frequent a single establishment until
F27 0510 10    its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as
F27 0520  9    interested in wine as in spending money. Only then,
F27 0530  4    perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.
F27 0540  1       Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed
F27 0540 10    to rest for several weeks before it is served. This
F27 0550  9    is especially true of red wines, and a practice which,
F27 0560  7    though not always practicable, is well worth the effort.
F27 0570  4    It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter
F27 0580  1    of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal.
F27 0580 13    Wine stored for a long time should be on its side;
F27 0590 10    otherwise, the cork dries and air enters to spoil it.
F27 0600  7    When stacking wine on its side in a bin, care should
F27 0610  3    always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left
F27 0610 15    next to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies,
F27 0620  9    have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need
F27 0630  8    little props, such as a bit of cardboard or a chip
F27 0640  4    of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.
F27 0650  1    Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again
F27 0650 11    with ill effects. The best rule of thumb for detecting
F27 0660  8    corked wine (provided the eye has not already spotted
F27 0670  5    it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling
F27 0680  2    it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all
F27 0680 13    right; if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.
F27 0690 11       Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for
F27 0700  9    wine: they age it prematurely. The ideal storage temperature
F27 0710  5    for long periods is about fifty-five degrees, with
F27 0720  3    an allowable range of five degrees above or below this,
F27 0730  2    provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged
F27 0730 11    vibration is also undesirable; consequently, one's
F27 0740  6    wine closet or cellar should be away from machines
F27 0750  6    or electrically driven furnaces. If one lives near
F27 0760  4    a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to
F27 0760 14    have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home
F27 0770 10    a few at a time. Light, especially daylight, is always
F27 0780  6    bad for wine.
F27 0780  9       All in all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense
F27 0790 10    expended over the preparations thought necessary for
F27 0800  4    ordinary wine drinking; many people go to extreme lengths
F27 0810  4    in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without
F27 0820  1    further investigation any bottle with so much as a
F27 0820 10    slightly suspicious cork. No one should wish to deny
F27 0830  8    these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from
F27 0840  4    all this, and to give fair warning where warning is
F27 0850  2    due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring
F27 0850 13    some degree of purism! But the fact remains that in
F27 0860  9    most restaurants, including some of the best of Paris
F27 0870  7    and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle is frankly and simply
F27 0880  5    brought from the cellar to the table when ordered,
F27 0890  1    and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives
F27 0890 10    takes place while the chef is preparing the meal. A
F27 0900  9    white wine, already at cool cellar temperature, may
F27 0910  4    be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water
F27 0920  2    or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the
F27 0920 10    former is far preferable) in about fifteen minutes;
F27 0930  6    for those who live in a winter climate, there is nothing
F27 0940  5    better than a bucket of water and snow. Though by no
F27 0950  3    means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly
F27 0950 12    be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened
F27 0960 10    twenty minutes or so before serving time. It may be
F27 0970  7    a bit cold when poured; but again, as one will have
F27 0980  5    observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should
F27 0990  1    be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is
F27 0990 11    never filled more than half full. In this way, red
F27 1000  8    wine warms of itself quite rapidly- and though it is
F27 1010  7    true that it may not attain its potential of taste
F27 1020  1    and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or
F27 1020 11    the course), in the meantime it will have run the gamut
F27 1030  9    of many beguiling and interesting stages. The only
F27 1040  4    cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine
F27 1050  3    is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in
F27 1050 16    front of an open fire. This invariably effaces any
F27 1060  7    wine's character, and drives its fragrance underground.
F27 1070  4       It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest
F27 1080  4    in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly
F27 1090  1    in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums,
F27 1090 10    Jeroboams, Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively.
F27 1100  5    Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration,
F27 1110  7    and any red wine, brought from the cellar within half
F27 1120  5    an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed
F27 1130  1    some air. But white wines never! White wines should
F27 1130 10    be opened when served, having been previously chilled
F27 1140  7    in proportion to their sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or
F27 1150  5    Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a
F27 1160  3    Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted
F27 1170  1    method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or
F27 1170 12    poor white wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly
F27 1180  8    less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature
F27 1190  6    which reveals it as unattractive.
F27 1200  1       The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die
F27 1200 11    a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is
F27 1210  9    exposed for long to the air. To quote Professor Saintsbury:
F27 1220  3    "The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as
F27 1230  5    the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or
F27 1240  2    Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This
F27 1240 12    does not mean, though, that a red wine improves with
F27 1250  9    prolonged aeration: there is a reasonable limit- and
F27 1260  6    wines kept over to the next meal or the next day, after
F27 1270  5    they have once been opened, are never as good. If this
F27 1280  2    must be done, they should always be corked and kept
F27 1280 12    in a cool place; it should be remembered that their
F27 1290  7    lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those
F27 1300  4    of milk.
F27 1300  6       A few red wines, notably those of the Beaujolais,
F27 1310  4    are better consumed at cellar temperature. By tradition,
F27 1320  2    a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-
F27 1330  3    if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for
F27 1330 13    the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment
F27 1340 10    have settled well. Thus, red wine must, if possible,
F27 1350  6    never be disturbed or shaken; very old red wine is
F27 1360  4    often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements
F27 1360 12    which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled
F27 1370 10    with the wine itself. A tug-of-war between an old bottle
F27 1380  9    and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as
F27 1390  6    a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually
F27 1400  1    and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.
F27 1400 11       Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine,
F27 1410  9    lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the
F27 1420  6    cradle and eventually to the table, without disturbing
F27 1430  2    the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut,
F27 1430 11    and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine
F27 1440 11    should first stand on end for several days to allow
F27 1450  8    the sediment to roll to the very bottom, after which
F27 1460  3    the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position
F27 1470  1    on its side in the cradle.
F27 1470  7       In France, when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant
F27 1480  4    and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the
F27 1490  1    restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and,
F27 1490 10    with the advice of the manager and his chef, builds
F27 1500  8    the menu around them. The wine waiter will see to it
F27 1510  6    that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened
F27 1520  1    at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed
F27 1520 11    to stand on end for as long as possible and, perhaps
F27 1530  9    in the case of very old wines, be decanted. Decanting
F27 1540  4    old wine aerates it fully; it may also be- practically
F27 1550  4    speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process
F27 1560  1    of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead
F27 1560 10    of several or more times at the table: hence, a minimum
F27 1570 10    of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs.
F27 1580  5       Though there are many exceptions, which we have
F27 1590  3    noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best
F27 1590 14    consumed between two and six years old, and red wines,
F27 1600 10    nowadays, between three and ten. Red wines of good
F27 1610  7    years tend to mature later and to keep longer; the
F27 1620  3    average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite
F27 1630  1    number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into
F27 1630 10    their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age,
F27 1640  9    or even more. If a red Bordeaux of a good name and
F27 1650  6    year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting,
F27 1660  1    leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais,
F27 1660 13    on the other hand, should be drunk while very young;
F27 1670 10    and Alsatians may be.
