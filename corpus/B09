B09 0010  1       Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last
B09 0010  8    night of each summer at Loon Lake. The narrow fringe
B09 0020  8    of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure.
B09 0030  6       The evening was not always spent in the same way.
B09 0040  6    This year, on a night cool with the front of September
B09 0050  1    moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the
B09 0050 11    Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the
B09 0060  8    Pod. The little cottage was bursting with people of
B09 0070  6    all ages.
B09 0070  8       In the midst of it all, Mr. Podger came out on the
B09 0080  7    Pod porch, alone. He had that day attended a country
B09 0090  4    auction, and he had come back with a prize.
B09 0100  1       The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock,
B09 0100  9    complete with cross-top pillow, fringed side pieces,
B09 0110  5    and hooks for hanging. Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed
B09 0120  4    things around on the porch to make room for it, and
B09 0130  3    there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night
B09 0130 14    breeze rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.
B09 0140  9       Mr. Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and
B09 0150 10    forth in one or two slow, rhythmic motions, and then
B09 0160  6    swung his feet up into it. He closed his eyes and let
B09 0170  5    the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly
B09 0180  1    over him. Suddenly one young voice rose above the others.
B09 0180 11    "But", it said, "do you always know when you're happy"?
B09 0200  1       The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound,
B09 0200 11    but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind. Here,
B09 0210  7    in the cool, autumn-touched evening, Mr. Podger mentally
B09 0220  5    retraced a day that had left him greatly contented
B09 0230  2    and at peace.
B09 0230  5    #@#
B09 0230  6    It had begun with the blue jay feather. Walking along
B09 0240  4    the lake before breakfast, Mr. Podger had seen the
B09 0250  3    feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight. The
B09 0250 14    winging spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly,
B09 0260  9    into the wood. The small shaft of blue had drifted
B09 0270  7    down and come to rest at his feet. All day long Mr.
B09 0280  4    Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had
B09 0285  1    worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.
B09 0290 11    Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy
B09 0300  9    all day? Hardly. But it was something to have seen
B09 0310  6    it floating down through the early morning sunshine,
B09 0320  2    linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters
B09 0320 14    by the lake.
B09 0330  3       Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he
B09 0330 12    had walked to it. And there, on the way, had been the
B09 0340 12    box turtle, that slow, self-contained, world-ignoring
B09 0350  6    relic of pre-history, bent, for reasons best known
B09 0360  4    to itself, on crossing the road. It was doing very
B09 0370  1    well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing
B09 0370 10    its way with commendable singleness of purpose when
B09 0380  5    Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a
B09 0390  6    flashy little sports car. Would the driver see the
B09 0400  2    turtle? Would he take pains to avoid it?
B09 0400 10       Mr. Podger took no chances. Taking off his hat and
B09 0410  9    signaling the driver with it, Mr. Podger stepped into
B09 0420  6    the road, lifted the surprised turtle and consummated
B09 0430  3    its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking
B09 0440  1    suddenness.
B09 0440  2       The turtle immediately withdrew into its private
B09 0450  1    council room to study the phenomenon. But Mr. Podger
B09 0450 10    and the driver of the sports car waved at each other.
B09 0460 10    Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel
B09 0470  6    the warmth of midday, could still see the yellow butterflies
B09 0480  5    dancing over the road, could still see the friendly
B09 0490  2    grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked
B09 0490 13    back over his shoulder for a moment before the car
B09 0500 10    streaked out of sight.
B09 0510  1       Where was the driver now? What was he doing? And
B09 0510 11    the turtle? Mr. Podger smiled. For a few brief minutes
B09 0520  9    they had all been part of one little drama. The three
B09 0530  8    would never meet again, but for some reason or other
B09 0540  5    Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident.
B09 0550  3       Then there had been the auction itself. Mr. Podger
B09 0560  2    heard again, at will, the voice of the auctioneer,
B09 0560 11    the voices of the bidders, and finally the small boy
B09 0570  9    who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock
B09 0580  5    purchase.
B09 0580  6       "I like them things, too", he had said. "We got
B09 0590  7    one at home. You know what? If you're lyin' out in
B09 0600  5    the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool- you know-
B09 0610  5    you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-
B09 0620  1    and wrap 'em right over you. I do it, lots o' times-
B09 0620 13    I like to lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when
B09 0630 10    it's all quiet. ... The wind moves it a little bit-
B09 0640  7    you know ...".
B09 0640 10    #@#
B09 0640 11    Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely, and now he made
B09 0650  8    use of the advice. As he pulled the fringed sides up
B09 0660  5    and made himself into a cocoon, Mr. Podger saw that
B09 0670  3    thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped
B09 0670 11    that the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped
B09 0680 11    quiet.
B09 0680 12       Alacrity, the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed
B09 0690  9    her back briefly against it, and then, sure of a welcome,
B09 0700  9    hopped up. She remarked that she found the night wind
B09 0710  6    a little chilly, and Mr. Podger took her inside the
B09 0720  3    fringe. Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the
B09 0720 12    tree crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside
B09 0730  9    the Pod.
B09 0730 11       Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures
B09 0740  9    of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst
B09 0750  6    out. "Dad"! she said. "It's getting so chilly we've
B09 0760  5    lighted a fire, and we're going to tell a round robin
B09 0770  4    story- a nice, scary one. We need you to start it.
B09 0770 15    Why are you out here all by yourself? Aren't you happy"?
B09 0790  1       Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking
B09 0790  9    Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire.
B09 0800 10    "Of course I am", he said. "Never happier in my life.
B09 0810  6    I just came out here to know it".
B09 0820  1    _DALLAS_
B09 0820  2       As the South begins another school year, national
B09 0820 10    and even world attention is directed at the region's
B09 0840  7    slow progress toward racial equality in the public
B09 0850  5    schools.
B09 0850  6       Desegregation is beginning in two more important
B09 0860  4    Southern cities- Dallas and Atlanta. In each city civic
B09 0870  3    and education leaders have been working hard to get
B09 0870 12    public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability
B09 0880  7    of equal treatment.
B09 0890  1       These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial
B09 0890  8    classrooms peacefully. The programs do not take sides
B09 0900  7    on the issue itself. They point out simply that "it
B09 0910  5    is the law of the land".
B09 0910 11       The two cities have the examples of Little Rock
B09 0920  8    and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting
B09 0930  5    to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation.
B09 0940  3    Even better, they have the examples of Nashville and
B09 0950  2    Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.
B09 0960  1       In each case there was an initial act of violence.
B09 0960 11    In Nashville, a school was dynamited. In Houston, there
B09 0970  7    were a few incidents of friction between whites and
B09 0980  4    Negroes, none of which were serious.
B09 0990  1       In each city quick public reaction and fast action
B09 0990  9    by the city government halted the threats of more serious
B09 1000  7    incidents.
B09 1000  8       The Nashville plan, incidentally, has become recognized
B09 1010  6    as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical
B09 1020  6    to put into effect in the troubled South. It is a "stair-step"
B09 1030  6    plan, in which desegregation begins in the first grade.
B09 1040  4    Each year another grade is added to the process, until
B09 1050  1    finally all 12 grades are integrated. The schedules
B09 1050  9    are flexible so that the program can be accelerated
B09 1060  8    as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that
B09 1070  4    it is something that has to be done, "so why not now".
B09 1080  3       The program has worked well in both Nashville and
B09 1090  1    Houston. It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where
B09 1090 11    the two schools selected for the first moves toward
B09 1100  7    integration were boycotted by white parents. Another
B09 1110  4    attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume
B09 1120  3    the program.
B09 1120  5       Generally, throughout the South, there is a growing
B09 1130  2    impatience with the pattern of violence with which
B09 1130 10    every step of desegregation is met.
B09 1140  6       Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of
B09 1150  4    racial barriers has been in Dallas. During the summer,
B09 1160  1    Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated
B09 1160  7    restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.
B09 1170  8    It was part of a citywide move toward full integration.
B09 1180  8       So successful has been this program, worked out
B09 1190  6    by white and Negro civic leaders, that further extensions
B09 1200  3    are expected in the next few months. Hotels, for example,
B09 1210  2    are ready to let down the bars. Already, at least one
B09 1210 13    hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial
B09 1220  9    basis. Several conventions have been held in recent
B09 1230  6    months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis.
B09 1240  2       This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions
B09 1250  1    which prevailed several years ago, when a series of
B09 1250 10    bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving
B09 1260  6    into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas.
B09 1270  3       It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which
B09 1280  2    appears to be spreading all across the South. Southern
B09 1290  1    whites themselves are realizing that they had been
B09 1290  9    wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from
B09 1300  7    claiming equal rights. They insist they are ashamed
B09 1310  4    of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama
B09 1320  1    when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial
B09 1320 10    discrimination in local bus depots.
B09 1330  5       All across the South there are signs that racial
B09 1340  3    violence is finding less approval among whites who
B09 1340 11    themselves would never take active part but might once
B09 1350  9    have shown a tolerant attitude toward it.
B09 1360  4       There are many causes for this change. One of the
B09 1370  3    most important is economic. Business leaders are aware
B09 1370 11    now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.
B09 1380 10    They are putting strong pressure on their police departments
B09 1390  7    to keep order. In the past these same Southerners were
B09 1400  6    inclined to look the other way.
B09 1410  1       And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real
B09 1410 11    sense of co-operation has sprung up. This co-operation
B09 1420  7    has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices
B09 1430  5    to demands for peaceable accommodation. They realize
B09 1440  2    that by acting in concert, rather than individually,
B09 1440 10    they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation-
B09 1450  9    economic and otherwise.
B09 1470  1       Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California
B09 1470 10    a few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game
B09 1480 11    called Lanesmanship. Played mostly on the freeways
B09 1490  6    around Los Angeles, it goes like this:
B09 1500  2       A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane A
B09 1510  2    of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam
B09 1510 12    ahead. Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving
B09 1520  9    more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane
B09 1530  6    B, which is heavily populated by cars also moving
B09 1540  3    at 70 m.p.h.
B09 1540  6       The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices
B09 1550  5    open to him. He can (1) point his car resolutely at
B09 1560  2    the invading fender and force the other driver back
B09 1560 11    into Lane A; (2) slow down and permit the ambivalent
B09 1570  9    driver to change lanes; or (3) alternately accelerate
B09 1580  5    and decelerate, thus keeping the first driver guessing
B09 1590  4    as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating
B09 1600  1    sport of the whole affair.
B09 1600  6       The really remarkable thing to me is that most California
B09 1610  6    natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit
B09 1620  3    the invading car free access. Whether or not this is
B09 1620 13    done out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't
B09 1630  8    know. But it is done, consistently and I'm both surprised
B09 1640  6    and impressed.
B09 1640  8    #@#
B09 1640  9    This could never happen in my native Chicago. There
B09 1650  9    such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure
B09 1660  8    sign of deteriorating manhood. In Chicago, the driver
B09 1670  4    cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor
B09 1680  1    in an effort to force the other car back. Failing this,
B09 1680 12    he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and
B09 1690  7    shake his fist threateningly.
B09 1700  1       This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways,
B09 1700  9    however, does an injustice to Southern California drivers.
B09 1710  8    At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall
B09 1720  9    Field and Company, I would like to challenge an old
B09 1730  6    and hallowed stereotype. After three months of research,
B09 1750  3    I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers
B09 1750 11    are considerably more courteous and competent than
B09 1760  7    any other drivers I've ever encountered.
B09 1770  3       During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles
B09 1780  2    there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming
B09 1780 10    drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit
B09 1790  9    me to pull out of an impossible side street.
