F31 0010  1    The person who left the buggy there has never been
F31 0010 11    identified. It was a busy street, conveniently near
F31 0020  6    the shopping center, and unattended horses and wagons
F31 0030  4    were often left at the curbside.
F31 0030 10       There are, of course, many weaknesses in any case
F31 0040  8    against Emma. She didn't like her stepmother, but nothing
F31 0050  5    is known to have occurred shortly before the crime
F31 0060  3    that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had
F31 0060 13    no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity
F31 0070  9    for murder existed. She would have been taking more
F31 0080  7    than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during
F31 0090  2    her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy,
F31 0100  1    the stableman might have recognized her. If police
F31 0100  9    had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated,
F31 0110  7    she would be completely eliminated as a suspect.
F31 0120  4    ##
F31 0120  5    Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular
F31 0130  2    suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden
F31 0140  1    home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of
F31 0140 13    baggage with him, although he clearly intended to stay
F31 0150  7    overnight, if not longer.
F31 0160  1       Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her
F31 0160  9    father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon
F31 0170  7    before the murders, she had been disturbed by their
F31 0180  4    voices and had closed her door, even though it was
F31 0190  1    a very hot day.
F31 0190  5       It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything
F31 0200  1    she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse.
F31 0200 10    At that time Jennings had a young law associate named
F31 0210  9    Arthur S. Phillips. A few years ago, not too long before
F31 0220  9    his death, Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that
F31 0230  6    he had always suspected Morse of the murders. He said
F31 0240  3    Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house
F31 0240 12    that day, information which must have come from Lizzie.
F31 0250  9    It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused
F31 0260  8    Lizzie to close her door.
F31 0270  1       The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton
F31 0280  1    as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew
F31 0280 12    what Borden said during his conversation with Morse,
F31 0290  6    he would have convicted "somebody". Notice, Knowlton
F31 0300  3    did not say that he would have obtained a conviction
F31 0310  2    in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have
F31 0310 13    convicted "somebody".
F31 0320  2       It is known that Morse did associate with a group
F31 0330  3    of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters
F31 0330 11    at Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were
F31 0340 11    a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable
F31 0350  8    characters. Fall River police did go to Westport to
F31 0360  6    see if they could get any information against Morse
F31 0370  2    and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have
F31 0370 11    hired from among these men. These officers found no
F31 0380  8    incriminating information.
F31 0390  1       Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He
F31 0390 11    said he returned from the visit to his niece on the
F31 0400 10    11:20 streetcar. The woman in the house where the niece
F31 0410  7    was staying backed up his story and said she left when
F31 0420  4    he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a
F31 0430  1    fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve
F31 0430  9    noon. If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to
F31 0440  7    start her shopping, she would have had little time
F31 0450  4    in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten
F31 0460  2    at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse
F31 0460 12    told the woman it was 11:20, but it could have been
F31 0470  9    earlier, since she did serve dinner on time. Police
F31 0480  5    did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi. They
F31 0490  2    interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said
F31 0490 10    he had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as
F31 0500 11    a passenger. Questioned further, Morse said that there
F31 0510  6    had been four or five priests riding on the same car
F31 0520  5    with him. The conductor did recall having priests as
F31 0530  2    passengers and this satisfied police, although the
F31 0530  9    conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic
F31 0540  7    Fall River there were priests riding on almost every
F31 0550  5    trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement really
F31 0560  2    proved nothing.
F31 0560  4       We do know that Morse left the house before nine
F31 0570  3    o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through
F31 0570 11    the side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked
F31 0580 11    the screen door. From that point on he said he went
F31 0590  9    to the post office and then walked leisurely to where
F31 0600  4    his niece was staying, more than a mile away. He met
F31 0610  3    nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting
F31 0610 13    of his movements in this long gap of time which covers
F31 0620  9    the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed.
F31 0630  4       Morse testified that while he was having breakfast
F31 0640  2    in the dining room, Mrs. Borden told the servant, "Bridget,
F31 0650  1    I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's
F31 0650 10    testimony was in direct contradiction. She said it
F31 0660  8    was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the
F31 0670  7    back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows.
F31 0680  6    This was long after Morse had left the house.
F31 0690  1       Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget
F31 0690  9    could indicate that he had returned secretly to the
F31 0700  9    house and was hidden there. He knew the house fairly
F31 0710  7    well, he had been there on two previous visits during
F31 0720  3    the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's
F31 0730  1    attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter
F31 0730 11    than a drum, this was not true. The screen door was
F31 0740 11    unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget
F31 0750  6    was sick in the back. It was unlocked all the time
F31 0760  4    she was washing windows. Morse could have returned
F31 0770  1    openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and
F31 0770 11    gone up to the room he had occupied. Mrs. Borden would
F31 0780  7    not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or
F31 0790  7    hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm the previous
F31 0800  3    day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet
F31 0810  1    at the farm. Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to
F31 0810 12    disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough
F31 0820  8    to her to swing before she could cry out. He could
F31 0830  6    have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and
F31 0840  3    made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.
F31 0840 13       If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on
F31 0850 10    his return, he could have arrived at the Borden house
F31 0860  7    shortly after Mr. Borden came home. With Lizzie in
F31 0870  5    the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs
F31 0880  2    in her attic room, he would have had free and easy
F31 0880 13    access to the house. With the second murder over, he
F31 0890  9    could have left, hidden the weapon in some vacant lot
F31 0900  6    or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood. His unconcerned
F31 0910  3    stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, with
F31 0920  2    crowds already gathering in front of the building and
F31 0920 11    Sawyer guarding the side door, was odd. There was no
F31 0930  9    close examination of his clothes for bloodstains, and
F31 0940  5    certainly no scientific test was made of them. And
F31 0950  3    for a man who traveled around without any change of
F31 0950 13    clothing, a few more stains on his dark suit may very
F31 0960 11    well have gone unnoticed.
F31 0970  1       The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel;
F31 0970  9    there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders.
F31 0980  9       On the other side of the ledger is the fact that
F31 0990  8    he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was
F31 1000  4    staying. The time would have been shortly after the
F31 1010  1    murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual
F31 1010 10    in his behavior. He said he had promised Mrs. Borden
F31 1020  8    to return in time for dinner and that was close to
F31 1030  6    the time when he did turn up at the Borden house.
F31 1040  2    ##
F31 1040  3    What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible
F31 1050  1    suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:
F31 1050  9       "The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget
F31 1060  9    or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge.
F31 1070  5    Neither had any interest in the deaths; indeed, it
F31 1080  3    was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and
F31 1090  3    Mrs. Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated
F31 1100  1    by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion
F31 1100  9    of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect.
F31 1110  6       Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie
F31 1120  4    said, and read a sinister purpose into almost everything
F31 1130  2    she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget
F31 1140  1    as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be
F31 1140 11    said about the servant girl.
F31 1150  3       The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration,
F31 1160  1    but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported
F31 1160  9    in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer
F31 1170  8    had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse,
F31 1180  7    and she replied she didn't think he did it because
F31 1190  6    he left the house before the murders and returned after
F31 1200  2    them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget,
F31 1200 10    and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget
F31 1210 10    had gone up to her room before her father's murder
F31 1230  5    and came down when she called her.
F31 1240  1       Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told
F31 1240  9    police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling
F31 1250  8    with her father some weeks before the murders, but
F31 1260  6    she said she thought he was from out of town because
F31 1270  3    she heard him mention something about talking to his
F31 1270 12    partner. And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington,
F31 1280  8    she also did not accuse him. At the inquest she was
F31 1290  8    asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father
F31 1300  4    had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings toward
F31 1310  1    her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has
F31 1310 12    not been friendly with him. They have not been friendly
F31 1320  9    for years". Asked who this was, she named Harrington.
F31 1330  7    Her statement certainly was true; the press reported
F31 1340  4    the same facts in using Harrington's interview, but
F31 1350  2    Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington
F31 1350 11    was the killer.
F31 1360  2       When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up
F31 1360 12    pears in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in
F31 1370 11    the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under
F31 1380  7    any suspicion at the time of the murders. He said he
F31 1390  5    had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget Sullivan"?
F31 1400  2    I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there", he replied,
F31 1410  3    waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant
F31 1420  1    she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion
F31 1420 10    that existed at the time of the murders.
F31 1430  7       Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely
F31 1440  2    the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly
F31 1440 13    two people in and about the house at the time of both
F31 1450 12    murders: Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan.
F31 1460  5       All the officials on the case seem to have been
F31 1470  5    afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was
F31 1480  1    concerned, although records in police files contain
F31 1480  8    many reports of servants who have murdered their employers.
F31 1490  7    True, it is no longer cricket for the butler to be
F31 1500  6    the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing here
F31 1510  2    with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters
F31 1520  1    and situations.
F31 1520  3       The actions of Bridget should be examined, since
F31 1530  2    she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to
F31 1530 12    establish her innocence. There are also other factors
F31 1540  7    that require closer examination.
F31 1550  1       The legend as it exists in Fall River today always
F31 1550 11    includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned
F31 1560  7    to Ireland after the trial with a "big bundle" of cash
F31 1570  8    which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut. The
F31 1580  5    people who believe and retell the legend have apparently
F31 1590  2    never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not
F31 1590 12    know that the maid changed her testimony on several
F31 1600  9    key points, always to the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget
F31 1610  7    did get any bundles of cash, the last person who would
F31 1620  6    have rewarded her for services rendered would have
F31 1630  2    been Lizzie Borden.
F31 1630  5       Bridget was born in Ireland, one of fourteen children.
F31 1640  4    She was apparently the pioneer in her family because
F31 1650  1    she had no close relatives in this country at that
F31 1650 11    time. She worked as a domestic, first in Newport for
F31 1660  8    a year, and then in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
F31 1670  3    for another year. She finally settled in Fall River
F31 1680  2    and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed,
F31 1680 13    was hired by the Bordens.
F31 1690  5       I have previously described how, during the week
F31 1700  3    of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days
F31 1700 13    scrubbing and ironing clothes.
