G73 0010  1       THE recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz
G73 0010 10    movement seen by some as part of the "San Francisco
G73 0020 10    Renaissance" have been as popular as they are notorious.
G73 0030  8    "It might well start a craze like swallowing goldfish
G73 0050  4    or pee wee golf", wrote Kenneth Rexroth in an explanatory
G73 0060  4    note in the Evergreen Review, and he may have been
G73 0070  2    right.
G73 0070  3       Under the general heading "poetry-and-jazz" widely
G73 0080  1    divergent experiments have been carried out. Lawrence
G73 0080  8    Ferlenghetti and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated
G73 0090  6    on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that
G73 0100  6    is very closely related to both the musical forms of
G73 0110  3    jazz, and the vocabulary of the musician. Even musicians
G73 0110 12    themselves have taken to writing poetry. (Judy Tristano
G73 0120  8    now has poems as well as ballads written for her.)
G73 0130  8       But the best known exploiters of the new medium
G73 0140  5    are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen. Rexroth and
G73 0150  2    Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their
G73 0150 11    experiments. Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff, a name-dropper
G73 0160 10    of jazz heroes, and a student of traditional as well
G73 0170  8    as modern jazz. In San Francisco he has worked with
G73 0180  5    Brew Moore, Charlie Mingus, and other "swinging" musicians
G73 0190  3    of secure reputation, thus placing himself within established
G73 0200  2    jazz traditions, in addition to being a part of the
G73 0210  1    San Francisco "School".
G73 0210  4       Although Patchen has given previous evidence of
G73 0220  3    an interest in jazz, the musical group that he works
G73 0230  1    with, the Chamber Jazz Sextet, is often ignored by
G73 0230 10    jazz critics. (Downbeat did not mention the Los Angeles
G73 0240  7    appearance of Patchen and the Sextet, although the
G73 0250  6    engagement lasted over two months.) The stated goal
G73 0260  3    of the CJS is the synthesis of jazz and "serious"
G73 0270  1    music. Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established
G73 0270  8    jazz circles, and Patchen himself has remained outside
G73 0280  7    the San Francisco poetry group, maintaining a self-imposed
G73 0290  6    isolation, even though his conversion to poetry-and-jazz
G73 0300  5    is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear.
G73 0310  2    He had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951,
G73 0310 13    and his entire career has been characterized by radical
G73 0320  9    experiments with the form and presentation of his poetry.
G73 0330  8    However, his subject matter and basic themes have remained
G73 0340  6    surprisingly consistent, and these, together with certain
G73 0350  3    key poetic images, may be traced through all his work,
G73 0360  2    including the new jazz experiments.
G73 0360  7       From the beginning of his career, Patchen has adopted
G73 0370  6    an anti-intellectual approach to poetry. His first
G73 0380  3    book, Before the Brave (1936), is a collection of poems
G73 0390  3    that are almost all Communistic, but after publication
G73 0390 11    of this book he rejected Communism, and advocated a
G73 0410  5    pacifistic anarchy, though retaining his revolutionary
G73 0420  4    idiom. He spoke for a "proletariat" that included "all
G73 0430  4    the lost and sick and hunted of the earth". Patchen
G73 0440  1    believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry
G73 0440 11    and money-hungry people. Running counter to the destroying
G73 0450  9    forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate
G73 0460  9    in man, the capacity for love and brotherhood, the
G73 0470  4    ability to appreciate beauty. Beauty as well as love
G73 0480  3    is redemptive, and Patchen preaches a kind of moral
G73 0480 12    salvation. This salvation does not take the form of
G73 0490  9    a Christian Heaven. In Patchen's eyes, organized churches
G73 0500  5    are as odious as organized governments, and Christian
G73 0510  3    symbols, having been taken over by the moneyed classes,
G73 0520  2    are now agents of corruption. Patchen envisions a Dark
G73 0520 11    Kingdom which "stands above the waters as a sentinel
G73 0530  9    warning man of danger from his own kind". The Dark
G73 0540  7    Kingdom sends Angels of Death and other fateful messengers
G73 0550  5    down to us with stern tenderness. Actually Heaven and
G73 0560  3    the Dark Kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of
G73 0570  1    heavenly life after death.
G73 0570  5       Patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms;
G73 0580  3    he has experimented instead with personal myth-making.
G73 0590  1    Much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of
G73 0590 11    a "pseudo-anthropological" myth reference, which is
G73 0600  5    concerned with imaginary places and beings described
G73 0610  4    in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language.
G73 0620  1       These early experiments were evidently not altogether
G73 0620  8    satisfying to Patchen. Beginning in Cloth of the Tempest
G73 0630  9    (1943) he experimented in merging poetry and visual
G73 0640  6    art, using drawings to carry long narrative segments
G73 0650  3    of a story, as in Sleepers Awake, and constructing
G73 0660  1    elaborate "poems-in-drawing-and-type" in which it is
G73 0660 11    impossible to distinguish between the "art" and the
G73 0670  5    poetry. Art "makings" or pseudo-anthropological myths
G73 0680  5    did not meet all of Patchen's requirements for a poetic
G73 0690  4    frame of reference. Many of his poems purported to
G73 0700  2    be exactly contemporary and political; so during the
G73 0700 10    period approximately from 1941 to 1946, Patchen often
G73 0710  7    used private detective stories as a myth reference,
G73 0720  5    and the "private eye" as a myth hero. Speaking in terms
G73 0730  3    of sociological stereotype, the "private eye" might
G73 0740  1    appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons.
G73 0740 13    The private detective (at least in the minds of listeners
G73 0750  9    and readers all over the country) is an individual
G73 0760  6    hero fighting injustice. He is usually something of
G73 0770  3    an underdog, he must battle the organized police force
G73 0770 12    as well as recognized criminals. The private detective
G73 0780  8    must rely, as the Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does
G73 0790  7    in primitive myth, on his wits. The private detective
G73 0800  4    is militant against injustice, a humorous and ironic
G73 0810  3    explorer of the underworld; most important to Patchen,
G73 0810 11    he was a non-literary hero, and very contemporary.
G73 0820  9    In 1945, probably almost every American not only knew
G73 0830  6    who Sam Spade was, but had some kind of emotional feeling
G73 0840  5    about him. In The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer (1945)
G73 0850  2    Patchen exploited this national sentiment by making
G73 0860  1    his hero, Albert Budd, a private detective.
G73 0860  8       But since 1945, Sam Spade has undergone a metamorphosis;
G73 0870  7    he has become Friday on Dragnet, a mouthpiece of arbitrary
G73 0880  7    police authority. He has, like so many other secular
G73 0890  6    and religious culture symbols, gone over to the side
G73 0900  3    of the ruling classes. Obviously, the "private eye"
G73 0900 11    can have no more appeal for Patchen. To fill the job
G73 0910 11    of contemporary hero in 1955, Patchen needed someone
G73 0920  6    else.
G73 0920  7       It was logical that he would come up with the figure
G73 0930  8    of the modern jazz musician. The revolution in jazz
G73 0940  3    that took place around 1949, the evolution from the
G73 0940 12    "bebop" school of Dizzy Gillespie to the "cool" sound
G73 0950  9    of Miles Davis and Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz, and
G73 0960  8    the whole legend of Charlie Parker, had made an impression
G73 0970  7    on many academic and literary men. The differentiation
G73 0980  4    between the East Coast and West Coast schools of jazz,
G73 0990  3    the differences between the "hard bop" school of Rollins,
G73 1000  1    and the "cerebral" experiments of Tristano, Konitz
G73 1000  8    and Marsh, the general differences in the mores of
G73 1010  9    white and negro musicians, all had become fairly well
G73 1020  6    known to certain segments of the public. The immense
G73 1030  3    amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger
G73 1040  1    generation must have impressed him, and he began working
G73 1040 10    toward the merger of jazz and poetry, as he had previously
G73 1050 10    attempted the union of graphic art and poetry. In addition
G73 1060  8    to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz, Patchen
G73 1070  5    is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician
G73 1080  3    as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of
G73 1080 16    the private detective a decade ago. In this respect,
G73 1090  9    his approach to poetry-and-jazz is in marked contrast
G73 1100  5    to Kenneth Rexroth's. Rexroth uses many of his early
G73 1110  6    poems when he reads to jazz, including many of his
G73 1120  2    Chinese and Japanese translations; he usually draws
G73 1120  9    some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and
G73 1130  8    the poem he is reading- for instance, he draws the
G73 1140  6    parallel between a poem he reads about an Oriental
G73 1150  1    courtesan waiting for the man she loves, and who never
G73 1150 11    comes, and the old blues chants of Ma Rainy and other
G73 1160 11    Negro singers- but usually the comparison is specious.
G73 1170  6    Rexroth may sometimes achieve an effective juxtaposition,
G73 1180  3    but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz
G73 1190  2    "feeling" in the text of his poems, relying on his
G73 1190 12    very competent musicians to supply this feeling.
G73 1200  6       Patchen does read some of his earlier works to music,
G73 1210  7    but he has written an entire book of short poems which
G73 1220  4    seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz.
G73 1230  1    These new poems have only a few direct references to
G73 1230 11    jazz and jazz musicians, but they show changes in Patchen's
G73 1240  7    approach to his poetry, for he has tried to enter into
G73 1250  8    and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician.
G73 1260  5       It is difficult to draw the line between stereotype
G73 1270  2    and the reality of the jazz musician. Everyone knows
G73 1270 11    that private detectives in real life are not like Sam
G73 1280 10    Spade and Pat Novak, but the real and the imaginary
G73 1290  7    musician are closely linked. Seen by the public, the
G73 1300  5    musician is the underdog par excellence. He is forced
G73 1310  3    to play for little money, and must often take another
G73 1310 13    job to live. His approach to music is highly individualistic;
G73 1320  9    the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements.
G73 1330  7    While he is worldly, the musician often cultivates
G73 1340  4    public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete.
G73 1350  3    The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he
G73 1360  1    is far from being a literary hero, yet is a creative
G73 1360 12    artist. Many of these aspects will be seen as comparable
G73 1370  8    to those of the ideal detective, but where the detective
G73 1380  5    is active and militant, the jazz musician is passive,
G73 1390  3    almost a victim of society. In order to write with
G73 1390 13    authority either about musicians, or as a musician,
G73 1400  8    Patchen would have to soft pedal his characteristically
G73 1410  4    outspoken anger, and change (at least for the purposes
G73 1420  4    of this poetry) from a revolutionary to a victim. He
G73 1430  1    must become one who knows all about the injustice in
G73 1430 11    the world, but who declines doing anything about it.
G73 1440  7       This involves a shift in Patchen's attitude and
G73 1450  4    it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry.
G73 1460  2    He has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his
G73 1460 10    earliest symbols and devices to the new work, and the
G73 1470 10    fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through
G73 1480  6    all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity
G73 1490  2    to his poetry. Perhaps tracing some of these more important
G73 1500  1    symbols through the body of his work will show that
G73 1500 11    Patchen's new poetry is well thought out, and remains
G73 1510  9    within the mainstream of his work, while being suited
G73 1520  7    to a new form.
G73 1520 11       Henry Miller characterized Patchen as a "man of
G73 1530  6    anger and light". His revolutionary anger is apparent
G73 1540  4    in most of his early poems. The following passage from
G73 1550  2    "The Hangman's Great Hands" illustrates the directness
G73 1560  1    of this anger. "Anger won't help. I was born angry.
G73 1560 11    Angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills;
G73 1570 11    Angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty.
G73 1580  9    Angry because I was that very one somebody was supposed
G73 1590  6    To be fighting for".
G73 1590 10       This angry and exasperated stance which Patchen
G73 1600  7    has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years
G73 1610  5    has been successfully modulated into a kind of woe
G73 1620  3    that is as effective as anger and still expresses his
G73 1620 13    disapproval of the modern world. In his recent book,
G73 1630  9    Hurray for Anything (1957), one of the most important
G73 1640  7    short poems- and it is the title poem for one of the
G73 1650  6    long jazz arrangements- is written for recital with
G73 1660  2    jazz. Although it does not follow the metrical rules
G73 1660 11    for a blues to be sung, the phrases themselves carry
G73 1670  8    a blues feeling. "I WENT TO THE CITY And there I did
G73 1680  9    Weep, Men a-crowing likes asses, And living like sheep.
G73 1690  5    Oh, can't hold the han' of my love! Can't hold her
G73 1700  4    little white han! Yes, I went to the city, And there
G73 1710  2    I did bitterly cry, Men out of touch with the earth,
G73 1710 13    And with never a glance at the sky. Oh, can't hold
G73 1720 11    the han' of my love! Can't hold her pure little han'!"
G73 1730  7    Patchen is still the rebel, but he writes in a doleful,
G73 1740  9    mournful tone. Neither of these poems is an aberration;
G73 1750  5    each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend
G73 1760  2    in the poet's development.
G73 1760  6       Patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death. In
G73 1770  5    many of his poems, death comes by train: a strongly
G73 1780  3    evocative visual image. Perhaps Patchen was once involved
G73 1790  1    in a train accident, and this passage from First Will
G73 1790 11    and Testament may have been how the accident appeared
G73 1800  8    to the poet when he first saw it- if he did: "
G73 1810  7       Lord love us, look at all the disconnected limbs
G73 1820  3    floating hereabouts, like bloody feathers at that-
G73 1830  3    and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving
G73 1830 15    and all the tongue are in all the cheek ...".
