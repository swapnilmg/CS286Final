J30 0010  1    _ANALYSIS_
J30 0010  2       Analysis means the evaluation of subparts, the comparative
J30 0020  1    ratings of parts, the comprehension of the meaning
J30 0020  9    of isolated elements. Analysis in roleplaying is usually
J30 0030  6    done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak
J30 0040  4    points of an individual or as a process to eliminate
J30 0050  2    weak parts and strengthen good parts.
J30 0060  1    _IMPERSONAL PURPOSES_
J30 0060  1       Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying
J30 0060 11    in terms of individuals. Roleplaying can be done for
J30 0070  8    quite a different purpose: to evaluate procedures,
J30 0080  4    regardless of individuals. For example: a sales presentation
J30 0090  4    can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying.
J30 0100  1    _EXAMPLES_
J30 0100  2       Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones
J30 0110  1    we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying
J30 0110  9    used for evaluation and analysis. One should keep in
J30 0120  7    mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying
J30 0130  4    are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry
J30 0140  4    to the extent that they have been in military and other
J30 0150  1    areas.
J30 0150  2    _EVALUATION_
J30 0150  3       The president of a small firm selling restaurant
J30 0160  1    products, had considerable difficulty in finding suitable
J30 0160  8    salesmen for his business. Interviewing, checking references,
J30 0170  7    training the salesmen, having them go with more experienced
J30 0180  8    salesmen was expensive- and the rate of attrition due
J30 0190  9    to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too
J30 0200  4    high. It was his experience that only one good salesman
J30 0210  1    was found out of every seven hired- and only one was
J30 0210 12    hired out of every seven interviewed.
J30 0220  5       Roleplaying was offered as a solution- and the procedure
J30 0230  6    worked as follows: all candidates were invited to a
J30 0240  3    hotel conference room, where the president explained
J30 0240 10    the difficulty he had, and how unnecessary it seemed
J30 0250  8    to him to hire people who just did not work out. In
J30 0260  7    place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires, checking
J30 0270  2    their references, interviewing them, asking them to
J30 0280  1    be tried out, he told them he would prefer to test
J30 0280 12    them. Each person was to enter the testing room, carrying
J30 0290  8    a suitcase of samples. Each salesman was to read a
J30 0300  5    sheet containing a description of the product. In the
J30 0310  2    testing room he was to make, successively, three presentations
J30 0320  1    to three different people.
J30 0320  5       In the testing room, three of the veteran salesmen
J30 0330  2    served as antagonists. One handled the salesman in
J30 0330 10    a friendly manner, another in a rough manner, and the
J30 0340 10    third in a hesitating manner. Each was told to purchase
J30 0350  7    material if he felt like it. The antagonists came in,
J30 0360  4    one at a time, and did not see or hear the other presentations.
J30 0370  2    After each presentation, the antagonist wrote his judgment
J30 0380  1    of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting
J30 0380 10    of the president, three of his salesmen and a psychologist.
J30 0390  9       Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten
J30 0400  8    more in the afternoon. This procedure was repeated
J30 0410  3    one day a month for four months. The batting average
J30 0420  1    of one success out of seven increased to one out of
J30 0420 12    three. The president of the firm, calculating expenses
J30 0430  6    alone, felt his costs had dropped one-half while success
J30 0440  5    in selection had improved over one hundred per cent.
J30 0450  3       The reason for the value of this procedure was simply
J30 0460  1    that the applicants were tested "at work" in different
J30 0460 10    situations by the judgment of a number of experts who
J30 0470 10    could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with
J30 0480  4    different, but typical restaurant owners and managers.
J30 0490  3    They were, in a sense, "tried out" in realistic situations.
J30 0500  1       From the point of view of the applicants, less time
J30 0510  1    was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal
J30 0510 11    out of it as well as some insights into their performances.
J30 0520  7       Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates
J30 0530  4    how this procedure can be used in real life situations
J30 0540  4    without special equipment or special assistants during
J30 0550  1    the daily course of work.
J30 0550  6       The position of receptionist was opened in a large
J30 0560  5    office and an announcement was made to the other girls
J30 0570  2    already working that they could apply for this job
J30 0570 11    which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary
J30 0580  6    than typing and clerking positions. All applicants
J30 0590  3    were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist.
J30 0600  1    At the end of work one day, the personnel man took
J30 0600 12    the applicants one at a time, asked them to sit behind
J30 0610 10    the receptionist's desk and he then played the role
J30 0620  7    of a number of people who might come to the receptionist
J30 0630  3    with a number of queries and for a number of purposes.
J30 0640  1    Each girl was independently "tested" by the personnel
J30 0640  9    man, and he served not only as the director, but as
J30 0650 10    the antagonist and the observer.
J30 0660  1       Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl,
J30 0660 10    whom he would never have considered for the job since
J30 0670 10    she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in
J30 0680  7    the office a relatively short time, did the most outstanding
J30 0690  4    job of playing the role of receptionist, showing wit,
J30 0700  2    sparkle, and aplomb. She was hired and was found to
J30 0700 12    be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight
J30 0710  8    hours a day.
J30 0720  1    _ANALYSIS_
J30 0720  1       In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter
J30 0720  8    a more complex area, since we are now no longer dealing
J30 0730  8    with a simple over-all decision but rather with the
J30 0740  5    examination and evaluation of many elements seen in
J30 0750  2    dynamic functioning. Some cases in evidence of the
J30 0750 10    use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the
J30 0760  7    procedure.
J30 0760  8       An engineer had been made the works manager of a
J30 0770  9    firm, supplanting a retired employee who had been considered
J30 0780  5    outstandingly successful. The engineer had more than
J30 0790  3    seven years of experience in the firm, was well trained,
J30 0790 13    was considered a hard worker, was respected by his
J30 0800  9    fellow engineers for his technical competence and was
J30 0810  6    regarded as a "comer". However, he turned out to be
J30 0820  6    a complete failure in his new position. He seemed to
J30 0830  2    antagonize everyone. Turnover rates of personnel went
J30 0830  9    up, production dropped, and morale was visibly reduced.
J30 0840  7    Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding
J30 0850  6    engineer, he seemed to be a very poor administrator,
J30 0860  2    although no one quite knew what was wrong with him.
J30 0860 12    At the insistence of his own supervisor- the president
J30 0870  9    of the firm, he enrolled in a course designed to develop
J30 0880  8    leaders.
J30 0880  9       He played a number of typical situations before
J30 0890  7    observers, other supervisors who kept notes and then
J30 0900  5    explained to him in detail what he did they thought
J30 0910  1    was wrong. Entirely concerned with efficiency, he was
J30 0910  9    merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes,
J30 0920  6    condemning them to too great an extent. He did not
J30 0930  5    really listen to others, had little interest in their
J30 0940  1    ideas, and wanted to have his own way- which was the
J30 0940 12    only right way. The entire group of managers explained,
J30 0950  8    in great detail, a number of human relations errors
J30 0960  5    that he made.
J30 0960  8       One by one, these errors were discussed and one
J30 0970  6    by one he rejected accepting them as errors. He admitted
J30 0980  3    his behavior, and defended it. He refused to change
J30 0990  1    his approach, and instead he attacked high and low-
J30 0990 10    the officials for their not backing him, and subordinates
J30 1000  7    for their laxness, stupidity, and stubbornness. After
J30 1010  4    the diagnosing, he left the course, convinced that
J30 1020  2    it could do him no good.
J30 1020  8       We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that
J30 1030  5    he refused treatment. The engineer turned works manager
J30 1040  2    had a particular view of life- and refused to change
J30 1040 12    it. We may say that his attitude was foolish, since
J30 1050  9    he may have been a success had he learned some human
J30 1060  6    relations skills; or we may say that his attitude was
J30 1070  4    commendable, showing his independence of mind, in his
J30 1080  1    refusal to adjust to the opinions of others. In any
J30 1080 11    case, he refused to accept the implications of the
J30 1090  7    analysis, that he needed to be made over.
J30 1100  2       Another case may be given in illustration of a successful
J30 1110  1    use of analysis, and also of the employment of a procedure
J30 1110 12    for intensive analysis. In a course for supermarket
J30 1120  7    operators, a district manager who had been recently
J30 1130  5    appointed to his position after being outstandingly
J30 1140  1    successful as a store manager, found that in supervising
J30 1140 10    other managers he was having a difficult time. On playing
J30 1150 10    some typical situations before a jury of his peers
J30 1160  7    he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory.
J30 1170  3    He was told he displayed, for example, a sense of superiority-
J30 1180  3    and he answered: "Well, I am supposed to know all the
J30 1190  3    answers, aren't I"? He was criticized for his curtness
J30 1200  1    and abruptness- and he answered: "I am not working
J30 1200 10    to become popular". On being criticized for his arbitrary
J30 1210  8    behavior- he answered: "I have to make decisions. That's
J30 1220  7    my job". In short, as frequently happens in analyses,
J30 1230  6    the individual feels threatened and defends himself.
J30 1240  3    However, in this case the district manager was led
J30 1250  1    to see the errors of his ways. The necessary step between
J30 1250 12    diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity
J30 1260  7    of the criticisms. How this was accomplished may be
J30 1270  5    described, since this sometimes is a crucial problem.
J30 1280  2       The director helped tailor-make a check list of
J30 1280 11    the district manager's errors by asking various observers
J30 1290  7    to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they
J30 1300  6    felt he made. These errors were then collected and
J30 1310  4    written on a blackboard, condensing similar ideas.
J30 1320  1    Eighteen errors were located, and then the director
J30 1320  9    asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt
J30 1330  8    that this manager had made the particular errors. They
J30 1340  4    were asked to vote "true" if they thought they had
J30 1350  3    seen him make the error, "false" if they thought he
J30 1350 13    had not; and "cannot say" if they were not certain.
J30 1360 10       The manager sat behind the group so he could see
J30 1370  9    and count the hands that went up, and the director
J30 1380  5    wrote the numbers on the blackboard. No comments were
J30 1390  2    made during the voting. The results looked as follows:
J30 1390 11    **f.
J30 1400  1       The first eight of these eighteen statements, which
J30 1400  9    received at least one-half of the votes, were duplicated
J30 1410 10    to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager,
J30 1420  6    and when this particular manager roleplayed in other
J30 1430  4    situations, the members checked any items that appeared.
J30 1440  1    To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling
J30 1440  8    himself only during the sessions, they were rather
J30 1450  8    lengthy (about twenty minutes), the situations were
J30 1460  4    imperfectly described to the manager so that he would
J30 1470  3    not know what to expect, new antagonists were brought
J30 1470 12    on the scene unexpectedly, and the antagonists were
J30 1480  7    instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to
J30 1490  7    upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner
J30 1500  3    for which he had been previously criticized.
J30 1500 10       After every session, the check marks were totaled
J30 1510  8    up and graphed, and in this way the supervisor's progress
J30 1520  5    was charted.
J30 1520  7    _SUMMARY_
J30 1520  8       In life we learn to play our roles and we "freeze"
J30 1530 10    into patterns which become so habitual that we are
J30 1540  6    not really aware of what we do. We can see others more
J30 1550  3    clearly than we can see ourselves, and others can see
J30 1550 13    us better than we see ourselves. To learn what we do
J30 1560 11    is the first step for improvement. To accept the validity
J30 1570  7    of the judgments of others is the second step. To want
J30 1580  6    to change is the third step. To practice new procedures
J30 1590  2    under guided supervision and with constant feedback
J30 1590  9    is the fourth step. To use these new ways in daily
J30 1600 10    life is the last step. Roleplaying used for analysis
J30 1610  5    follows these general steps leading to training.
J30 1620  2       When an evaluative situation is set up, and no concern
J30 1630  1    is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate,
J30 1630 12    we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation. Observers
J30 1640  7    can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior, and
J30 1650  5    watch him operating in a totalistic fashion. This behavior
J30 1660  3    is more "veridical"- or true than other testing behavior
J30 1670  3    for some types of evaluation, and so can give quick
J30 1670 13    and accurate estimates of complex functioning.
J30 1680  6       While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood
J30 1690  8    at the present time, it represents one of the major
J30 1700  5    uses of this procedure.
J30 1700  9    #CHAPTER X SPONTANEITY TRAINING#
J30 1710  2    THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CHAPTER is to clarify the distinctions
J30 1720  3    between spontaneity theory and other training concepts.
J30 1730  1    In addition, the basic approach utilized in applying
J30 1730  9    roleplaying will be reviewed. The goal will be to provide
J30 1740  9    the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him
J30 1750  5    in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training
J30 1760  3    area. The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying
J30 1770  1    application from the previous discussion of training
J30 1770  8    are twofold:
J30 1780  1    _1._
J30 1780  2       Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively
J30 1780  9    new.
