C13 0010  1       A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was
C13 0010 10    a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant
C13 0020  8    elephants, which in turn stood on the shell of a great
C13 0030  7    tortoise. This theory eventually proved inexact. But
C13 0040  2    the primitive method of explaining the unknown with
C13 0040 10    what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance
C13 0050  7    to the methods of modern science.
C13 0060  1       It is the business of cosmologists, the scientists
C13 0060  9    who study the nature and structure of the universe,
C13 0070  9    to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using
C13 0080  5    keys that have clicked open other doors. These keys
C13 0090  3    are the working principles of physics, mathematics
C13 0090 10    and astronomy, principles which are then extrapolated,
C13 0100  6    or projected, to explain phenomena of which we have
C13 0110  6    little or no direct knowledge.
C13 0120  1       In the autumn of 1959, the British Broadcasting
C13 0120  8    Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists
C13 0130  8    competent in cosmology. Three of these men discussed
C13 0140  5    major theories of the universe while the other acted
C13 0150  2    as a moderator. The participants were Professor H.
C13 0150 10    Bondi, professor of mathematics at King's College,
C13 0160  7    London; Dr. W. B. Bonnor, reader in mathematics at
C13 0170  7    Queen Elizabeth College, London; Dr. R. A. Lyttleton,
C13 0180  6    a lecturer at St. John's College, Cambridge, and a
C13 0190  5    reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of
C13 0200  3    Cambridge; and Dr. G. J. Whitrow, reader in applied
C13 0210  3    mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and
C13 0210 11    Technology, London.
C13 0220  2       Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator. The programs
C13 0230  2    were so well received by the British public that the
C13 0230 12    arguments have been published in a totally engrossing
C13 0240  8    little book called, "Rival Theories of Cosmology".
C13 0250  4       Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic
C13 0260  6    theories of the universe, based on the general theory
C13 0270  4    of relativity. First of all, and this has been calculated
C13 0280  1    by observation, the universe is expanding- that is,
C13 0280  9    the galaxies are receding from each other at immense
C13 0290  8    speeds. Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe
C13 0300  7    is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever
C13 0310  5    else is there. This expansion has been going on for
C13 0320  3    an estimated eight billion years.
C13 0320  8    #EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS#
C13 0320 11    Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both
C13 0330  9    expands and contracts, that in several billion years
C13 0340  6    the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that
C13 0350  5    the contraction will set in. Then, after many more
C13 0360  2    billions of years, when all the galaxies are whistling
C13 0360 11    toward a common center, this movement will slow down
C13 0370  8    and reverse itself again.
C13 0380  1       Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction
C13 0380  8    theory. He supports the steady-state theory which holds
C13 0390  9    that matter is continually being created in space.
C13 0400  5    For this reason, he says, the density of the universe
C13 0410  4    always remains the same even though the galaxies are
C13 0420  1    zooming away in all directions. New galaxies are forever
C13 0420 10    being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding
C13 0430 10    galaxies.
C13 0430 11       If this is true, then the universe today looks just
C13 0440  9    as it did millions of years ago and as it will look
C13 0450  7    millions of years hence, even though the universe is
C13 0460  2    expanding. For new galaxies to be created, Professor
C13 0460 10    Bondi declares, it would only be necessary for a single
C13 0470 10    hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of
C13 0480  8    your living room once every few million years. He contends
C13 0490  4    this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which
C13 0500  2    the principle of conservation of matter and energy
C13 0500 10    is based because some slight error must be assumed
C13 0510  7    in such experiments.
C13 0510 10       Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an
C13 0520 10    electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior
C13 0530  8    of protons and electrons. Protons and electrons bear
C13 0540  4    opposite electrical charges which make them attract
C13 0550  1    each other, and when they are joined they make up an
C13 0550 12    atom of hydrogen- the basic building block of matter.
C13 0560  9    The charges of the electron and proton are believed
C13 0570  5    to be exactly equal and opposite, but Dr. Lyttleton
C13 0580  2    is not so sure. Suppose, says Dr. Lyttleton, the proton
C13 0590  1    has a slightly greater charge than the electron (so
C13 0590 10    slight it is presently immeasurable). This would give
C13 0610  6    the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess.
C13 0620  1       Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface
C13 0630  1    of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms, it would be subject
C13 0630 12    both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess
C13 0640  9    of all those atoms in the sphere. Because electrical
C13 0650  6    forces (the charge-excess) are far more powerful than
C13 0660  4    gravitation, the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot
C13 0670  1    away from the sphere.
C13 0670  5       Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large
C13 0680  4    hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from
C13 0690  1    it. This, he claims, would reasonably account for the
C13 0690 10    expansion of the universe.
C13 0700  2    #FLEETING GLIMPSE#
C13 0700  4    This slim book, while giving the reader only a fleeting
C13 0710  5    glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe,
C13 0720  2    has the appeal that informed conversation always has.
C13 0720 10    Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the
C13 0730  8    non-scientist keep up with the discussion, and the
C13 0740  5    smooth language indicates the contributors were determined
C13 0750  3    to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into
C13 0750 14    almost every field.
C13 0760  3       It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists
C13 0770  1    of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when
C13 0770 10    a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices
C13 0780  8    which will open up new vistas to science. Presently,
C13 0790  6    the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the
C13 0800  4    earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.
C13 0810  1    These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded
C13 0810  9    by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering
C13 0820 10    or destroying cosmic theories.
C13 0830  2       There would seem to be some small solace in the
C13 0840  2    prospect that the missile race between nations is at
C13 0840 11    the same time accelerating the study of the space around
C13 0850  8    us, giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer
C13 0860  6    at alien regions.
C13 0860  9       In doing away with the tea tray, the elephants and
C13 0870  7    the giant tortoise, science has developed a series
C13 0880  3    of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.
C13 0890  1    And although the universe may forever defy understanding,
C13 0890  9    it might even now be finding its match in the imagination
C13 0900  9    of man. "Roots", the new play at the brand-new Mayfair
C13 0910 10    Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a
C13 0930  8    night club, is about the intellectual and spiritual
C13 0940  3    awakening of an English farm girl. Highly successful
C13 0950  1    in England before its transfer to New York, most of
C13 0950 11    "Roots" is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of
C13 0960  8    the small new theater are gaudy.
C13 0970  2       Only in its final scene, where Beatie Bryant (Mary
C13 0980  1    Doyle) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted
C13 0980  9    by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation
C13 0990  6    do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of
C13 1000  4    boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for
C13 1010  2    most of the first two and one-half acts.
C13 1010 11       The burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people
C13 1020  6    living close to the soil (at least in England) are
C13 1030  4    not the happy, fine, strong, natural, earthy people
C13 1040  1    city-bred intellectuals imagine. Rather they are genuine
C13 1040  9    clods, proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic
C13 1050  7    to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought.
C13 1060  6    They care no more for politics, says Mr. Wesker, than
C13 1070  5    they do for a symphony. Seeming to have roots in the
C13 1080  3    soil, they actually have none in life. They dwell,
C13 1080 12    in short, in the doltish twilight in which peasants
C13 1090  8    and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have
C13 1100  5    lived.
C13 1100  6       But this is a theme which does not take so much
C13 1110  5    time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it. So much
C13 1120  2    untidiness of mind and household does not attract the
C13 1120 11    interest of the theatergoer (unless he has been living
C13 1130  9    in a gilded palace, perhaps, and wants a real big heap
C13 1140  7    of contrast). The messy meals, the washing of dishes,
C13 1150  3    the drying of clothes may be realism, but there is
C13 1150 13    such a thing as redundancy.
C13 1160  5       Now for the good points. Miss Doyle as Beatie has
C13 1170  4    a great fund of animal spirits, a strong voice and
C13 1170 14    a warm smile. She is just home from a sojourn in London
C13 1180 12    where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow
C13 1190  8    named Ronnie (we never do see him) and has been subjected
C13 1200  7    to a first course in thinking and appreciating, including
C13 1210  2    a dose of good British socialism. But while she is
C13 1220  2    able to tell her retarded family about the new world
C13 1220 12    she has seen open before her, Ronnie has not been able
C13 1230  8    to observe her progress, and instead of appearing at
C13 1240  5    a family party to be looked over like a new bull, he
C13 1250  2    sends Beatie a letter of dismissal.
C13 1250  8       Beatie, getting no sympathy for her misfortune,
C13 1260  6    soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a
C13 1270  4    lover she has gained her freedom. Despite a too long
C13 1270 14    sustained declamatory flight, this final speech is
C13 1280  7    convincing, and we see why British audiences apparently
C13 1290  5    were impressed by "Roots".
C13 1300  1       There were several fairly good minor portraits in
C13 1300  9    the play, including William Hansen's impersonation
C13 1310  4    of a stubborn, rather pathetic father, and Katherine
C13 1320  4    Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother
C13 1330  2    who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter,
C13 1330 10    or anyone else. But I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and
C13 1340 10    potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local
C13 1350  7    audiences.
C13 1360  1       SHAKESPEARE had a word for everything, even for
C13 1360  9    the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's "Much Ado
C13 1370  7    About Nothing" opening the season of free theatre in
C13 1380  7    Central Park.
C13 1380  9       The New York Shakespeare Festival, which is using
C13 1390  7    the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre
C13 1400  5    near the Belvedere is being completed, began bravely.
C13 1410  3    Joseph Papp, impassioned founder of the festival and
C13 1420  1    director of "Much Ado", had a vibrant, colorful production
C13 1420 10    under way. Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled
C13 1430  9    music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited
C13 1440  6    mixture.
C13 1440  7       The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman
C13 1450  8    enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the
C13 1460  5    fence. The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick,
C13 1470  1    so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of
C13 1470 11    insult, raised chuckles. The simple-minded comedy of
C13 1480  7    Dogberry and Verges, also familiar in a day that responds
C13 1490  7    easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads,
C13 1500  3    evoked laughter. The vivacity of the masquers' party
C13 1510  2    at Leonato's palace, with the Spanish motif in the
C13 1510 11    music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of
C13 1520  9    Arragon, cast a spell of delight.
C13 1530  2    #@#
C13 1530  3    As "Much Ado" turned serious while the insipid Claudio
C13 1540  2    rejected Hero at the altar, a sprinkle began to fall.
C13 1540 12    At first hardly a person in the audience moved, although
C13 1550 10    some umbrellas were opened. But the rain came more
C13 1560  8    heavily, and men and women in light summer clothes
C13 1570  4    began to depart. The grieving Hero and her father,
C13 1580  1    Leonato, followed by the Friar, left the stage. A voice
C13 1580 11    on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain
C13 1590  8    let up the performance would resume in ten minutes.
C13 1600  6       More than half the audience departed. Some remained
C13 1610  3    in the Wollman enclosure, fortified with raincoats
C13 1620  1    or with newspapers to cover their heads. Others huddled
C13 1620 10    under the trees outside the fence. Twenty minutes after
C13 1630  7    the interruption, although it was still raining, the
C13 1640  6    play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where
C13 1650  3    it had been stopped.
C13 1650  7       Beatrice (Nan Martin) and Benedick (J. D. Cannon)
C13 1660  5    took their places on the stage. In their very first
C13 1670  3    speeches it was clear that Shakespeare, like a Nostradamus,
C13 1680  1    had foreseen this moment.
C13 1680  5       Said Benedick: "Lady Beatrice, have you wept all
C13 1690  5    this while"?
C13 1690  7       Replied Beatrice: "Yea, and I will weep a while
C13 1700  8    longer".
C13 1700  9       The heavens refused to give up their weeping. The
C13 1710  7    gallant company completed Act IV and got through part
C13 1720  5    of Act V. But the final scenes could not be played.
C13 1730  3    If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour
C13 1740  1    are in doubt about how it comes out, let them take
C13 1740 12    comfort. "Much Ado" ends happily.
C13 1750  4    #@#
C13 1750  5    The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing
C13 1760  4    the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare. One could hardly
C13 1770  2    blame Newbold Morris, the Parks Commissioner, for devoting
C13 1780  1    so much grateful mention to the department's technicians
C13 1780  9    who at short notice provided the stage with its rising
C13 1790  8    platforms, its balcony, its generous wings and even
C13 1800  6    its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains.
C13 1810  2       Eldon Elder, who designed the stage, also created
C13 1820  1    a gay, spacious set that blended attractively with
C13 1820  9    the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted
C13 1830  4    mood. Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has
C13 1840  4    verve and pace, although he has tolerated obvious business
C13 1850  2    to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency
C13 1850 10    of style would be preferable.
