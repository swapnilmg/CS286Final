G70 0010  2    We often say of a person that he "looks young for his
G70 0010 14    age" or "old for his age". Yet even in the more extreme
G70 0020 12    of such cases we seldom go very far astray in guessing
G70 0030  9    what his age actually is. And this means, I suppose,
G70 0040  5    that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily
G70 0050  2    recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the
G70 0050 11    mind. "Young for his age" means only the presence of
G70 0060  9    some minor characteristic not quite usual. Stigmata
G70 0070  5    quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there.
G70 0080  2    An assumption of youth, or the presence of a few youthful
G70 0090  1    characteristics, deceives no more successfully than
G70 0090  7    rouge or dyed hair. "Looking young for your age" means
G70 0110  8    "for your age" and it means no more.
G70 0120  5       A mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself
G70 0130  2    a little less obviously as old or young. Its surface
G70 0130 12    loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways
G70 0140  9    less immediately obvious than the body does. Youth
G70 0150  6    may be, and often is, skeptical, cynical or despairing;
G70 0160  2    age may be idealistic, believing and much given to
G70 0160 11    professions of optimism. But there is, nevertheless,
G70 0170  7    always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly
G70 0180  7    similar opinions are held. The pessimism of the young
G70 0190  5    is defiant, anxious to confess or even exaggerate its
G70 0200  2    ostensible gloom, and so exuberant as to reveal the
G70 0200 11    fact that it regards its ability to face up to the
G70 0210  8    awful truth as more than enough to compensate for the
G70 0220  3    awfulness of that truth. Similarly the optimism of
G70 0220 11    age protests too much. If it proclaims that the best
G70 0230 10    is yet to be, it always arouses, at least in the young,
G70 0240  7    either a suspicious question or perhaps the exclamation
G70 0250  3    of the Negro youth who saw on a tombstone the inscription,
G70 0260  2    "I am not dead but sleeping". "Boy, you ain't fooling
G70 0270  1    nobody but yourself".
G70 0270  4       We may say of some unfortunates that they were never
G70 0280  5    young. We cannot truthfully say of anyone who has succeeded
G70 0290  2    in entering deep into his sixties that he was never
G70 0290 12    old. Those famous lines of the Greek Anthology with
G70 0300  9    which a fading beauty dedicates her mirror at the shrine
G70 0310  7    of a goddess reveal a wise attitude: "Venus take my
G70 0320  4    votive glass, Since I am not what I was, What from
G70 0330  2    this day I shall be, Venus, let me never see".
G70 0330 12       No good can come of contemplating the sad, inevitable
G70 0340  9    fact that once youth has passed "a worse and worse
G70 0350  7    time still succeeds the former". But there are at least
G70 0360  6    two reasons for contemplating one's mind in even a
G70 0370  4    cracked mirror. One is that there sometimes are real
G70 0370 13    although inadequate compensations in growing old. Serenity,
G70 0380  7    if one is fortunate enough to achieve it, is not so
G70 0390  8    good as joy, but it is something. Even to be "from
G70 0400  5    hope and fear set free" is at least better than to
G70 0410  2    have lost the first without having got rid of the second.
G70 0410 13    The other reason (and the one with which I am here
G70 0420 10    concerned) is that one thus becomes inclined to inquire
G70 0430  5    of any opinion, or change of opinion, whether it represents
G70 0440  4    the wisdom of experience or is only the result of the
G70 0450  2    difference between youth and age which is as inevitable
G70 0450 11    as the all too obvious physical differences. One may
G70 0460  7    be exasperatingly aware that if the answer is favorable
G70 0470  7    it will be judged such only by those of one's own age.
G70 0480  4    But at least the question has been raised. Many readers
G70 0490  1    of this department no doubt discount certain of my
G70 0490 10    opinions for the simple reason that they can guess
G70 0500  8    pretty accurately, even if they have never actually
G70 0510  4    been told, what my age is. At least I should like them
G70 0520  2    to know that I know these discounts are being made.
G70 0520 12    ##
G70 0520 13    Let me then (and in public) glance into the mirror.
G70 0530 10    I have known some men and women who said that the selves
G70 0540  9    they are told about or even remember seem utter strangers
G70 0550  4    to them now; that their remote past is as discontinuous
G70 0560  2    with their present selves, as lacking in any conscious
G70 0570  1    likeness to their mature personality, as the self of
G70 0570 10    a butterfly may be imagined discontinuous with that
G70 0580  5    of the caterpillar it once was. For my part I find
G70 0590  5    it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs. I
G70 0600  1    have changed and I have reversed opinions; but I am
G70 0600 11    so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona
G70 0610  6    or ego that I see only as absurd the tendency of some
G70 0620  5    psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello and Proust
G70 0630  3    to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid
G70 0630 13    which nothing remains unchanged. So far as I am concerned,
G70 0640 10    the child is unmistakably father to the man, despite
G70 0650  7    the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly-
G70 0660  4    sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
G70 0670  3       Fundamental values, temperament and the way in which
G70 0680  1    one approaches a conviction change less, of course,
G70 0680  9    than specific opinions. That fact is very clearly illustrated
G70 0690  7    in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who
G70 0700  5    were Communists or near-Communists in their youth and
G70 0710  4    are now so extremely conservative (or reactionary,
G70 0710 11    as many would say) that they can define no important
G70 0720 10    political conviction that does not seem so far from
G70 0730  8    even a centrist position as to make the distinction
G70 0740  3    between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Khrushchev for them hardly
G70 0750  2    worth noting. But in ways more fundamental than specific
G70 0750 11    political opinions they are still what they always
G70 0760  8    were: passionate, sure without a shadow of doubt of
G70 0770  7    whatever it is that they are sure of, capable of seeing
G70 0780  3    black and white only and, therefore, committed to the
G70 0790  1    logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily
G70 0790 10    committed to.
G70 0800  1       To those of my readers who find many of my opinions
G70 0800 12    morally, or politically, or sociologically antiquated
G70 0810  5    (and I have reason to know that there are some such),
G70 0820  6    I would like to say what I have already hinted, namely,
G70 0830  3    that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some
G70 0840  1    discount on the simple ground that I am no longer young
G70 0840 12    and therefore incapable of being youthful of mind.
G70 0850  7    But I will also remind them that I have always been
G70 0860  5    inclined to skepticism, to a kind of Laodicean lack
G70 0870  2    of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned;
G70 0870 11    so that, although not as eager as I once was to be
G70 0880 11    disapproved of, I can still resist prevailing opinions.
G70 0900  4       At about the age of twelve I became a Spencerian
G70 0910  3    liberal, and I have always considered myself a liberal
G70 0920  1    of some kind even though the definition has changed
G70 0920 10    repeatedly since Spencer became a reactionary. Several
G70 0930  6    times in my youth I voted the Socialist ticket, but
G70 0940  5    less because I was Socialist than because I was not
G70 0950  4    either a Republican or a Democrat, and I voted for
G70 0960  1    Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate. Yet
G70 0960 10    during the years when I was on the staff of the Nation,
G70 0970 10    I tried to the limit the patience of the editors on
G70 0980  7    almost every occasion when I was permitted to write
G70 0990  3    an editorial having a bearing on a political or social
G70 1000  1    question.
G70 1000  2       Never once during the trying thirties did I come
G70 1000 11    so close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion
G70 1010 10    as to grant Russian communism even that most weasel-worded
G70 1020  7    of encomiums "an interesting experiment". There are
G70 1030  4    few things of which I am prouder than of that unblemished
G70 1040  4    record. Many of my friends at the time thought that
G70 1050  1    I had received a well-deserved condemnation when Lincoln
G70 1050 10    Steffens denounced me in a review of one of my books
G70 1060 11    as a perfect example of the obsolete man who could
G70 1070  6    understand and sympathize only with the dead past.
G70 1080  2    But he, as I can now retort, was the man who could
G70 1080 14    see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to
G70 1090 10    Russia he gave voice to the famous exclamation: "I
G70 1100  5    have seen the future and it works".
G70 1110  1       The favorite excuse of those who have now recanted
G70 1110 10    their approval of communism is that they did not know
G70 1120  9    how things would develop. With this excuse I have never
G70 1130  6    been much impressed. There was, it seems to me, enough
G70 1140  4    in the openly declared principles and intentions of
G70 1140 12    Russian leaders to alienate honorable men without their
G70 1150  8    having to wait to see how it would turn out.
G70 1160  8       Once many years ago I sat at dinner next to Arthur
G70 1170  4    Train, and the subject of the Nation came up. He asked
G70 1180  4    me suddenly, "What are your political opinions"? "Well",
G70 1190  2    I replied, "some of my colleagues on the paper regard
G70 1200  1    me as a rank reactionary". After a moment's thought
G70 1200 10    he replied, "That still leaves you a lot of latitude".
G70 1210  9    And I suppose it did.
G70 1220  2       I never have been, and am not now, any kind of utopian.
G70 1220 14    When I first came across Samuel Johnson's pronouncement,
G70 1230  8    "the remedy for the ills of life is palliative rather
G70 1240  9    than radical", it seemed to me to sum up the profoundest
G70 1250  8    of political and social truths. It will probably explain
G70 1260  4    more of my attitudes toward society than any other
G70 1270  2    phrase or principle could.
G70 1270  6    ##
G70 1270  7    Why did I choose to fill these pages in this particular
G70 1280  5    issue with this mixture of rather tenuous reflections
G70 1290  2    and autobiography? The reason is, I think, my awareness
G70 1300  1    that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have
G70 1300 11    served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency
G70 1310  8    to skepticism and dissent gets us nowhere, and that
G70 1320  5    I am simply too old to hope. I would, however, like
G70 1330  2    to suggest that, wrong though I may be, the tendency
G70 1330 12    to see dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which
G70 1340  9    I have been a victim ever since I can remember, and
G70 1350  6    therefore not merely a senile phenomenon. I know that
G70 1360  4    one must act. But one need not always be sure that
G70 1360 15    the action is either wise or conclusive.
G70 1370  7       Apropos of what some would call cynicism, I remember
G70 1380  5    an anecdote the source of which I forget. It concerns
G70 1390  3    a small-town minister who staged an impressive object
G70 1400  1    lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the
G70 1400 12    same cage outside his church door. Not only his parishioners,
G70 1410  8    but the whole town and, ultimately, the whole county
G70 1420  5    were enormously impressed by this object lesson. One
G70 1430  3    day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators
G70 1440  1    who wanted to know his secret. "How on earth do you
G70 1440 12    manage it? What is the trick"? "Why", he replied, "it
G70 1450  9    is perfectly simple; there is no trick involved. All
G70 1460  7    you have to do is put in a fresh lamb from time to
G70 1470  5    time". Cynical? Blasphemous? Not really, it seems to
G70 1480  4    me. The promise that the lion and the lamb will lie
G70 1480 15    down together was given in the future tense. It is
G70 1490 10    not something that can be expected to happen now.
G70 1500  6    ##
G70 1500  7    Without really changing the general subject, I take
G70 1510  4    this opportunity to confess that I am troubled by doubts,
G70 1520  2    not only about pacifism, but also when asked to join
G70 1520 12    in the protest against a law that most of those who
G70 1530  9    consider themselves humane and liberal seem to regard
G70 1540  6    as obviously barbarous; namely, the law that prescribes
G70 1550  3    the death penalty for murder when there seem to be
G70 1550 13    no extenuating circumstances. It is not that I am unaware
G70 1560 10    of the force of their strongest contention. Life, they
G70 1570  7    say, should be regarded as sacred and, therefore, as
G70 1580  5    something that neither an individual nor his society
G70 1590  2    has a right to take away. In fact I cannot imagine
G70 1590 13    myself condemning a man to the noose or the electric
G70 1600 10    chair if I had to take, as an individual, the responsibility
G70 1610  6    for his death. Just as I know I would make a bad soldier
G70 1620  7    even though I cannot sincerely call myself a pacifist,
G70 1630  3    so too I would not be either a hangman by profession
G70 1630 14    or, if I could avoid it, even a member of a hanging
G70 1640 12    jury. Despite these facts the question "Should no murderer
G70 1650  7    ever be executed"? seems to me to create a dilemma
G70 1660  7    not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a simple negative
G70 1670  3    answer.
G70 1670  4       Punishment of the wrongdoer, so liberals are inclined
G70 1680  3    to say, can have only three possible justifications:
G70 1690  1    revenge, reformation or deterrent example.
