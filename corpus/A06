A06 0010  1    _PLAINFIELD_
A06 0010  1       - James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen,
A06 0020  3    last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign
A06 0030  1    issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial
A06 0040  1    candidate, that the GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass
A06 0050  1    of Eisenhower Republicanism".
A06 0050  4       Mitchell was for using it, Jones against, and Sen.
A06 0060  4    Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when
A06 0070  4    the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke
A06 0080  1    at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park
A06 0080 10    Hotel.
A06 0090  1       The controversial remark was first made Sunday by
A06 0090  8    Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail
A06 0100  5    party at the Scotch Plains Country Club. It was greeted
A06 0110  6    with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday
A06 0120  3    at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.
A06 0130  1       Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention
A06 0130  9    of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass
A06 0140  9    of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism, but the
A06 0150  4    heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after
A06 0160  3    Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican Party
A06 0170  2    is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains
A06 0170 13    to the people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We
A06 0180 10    can love Eisenhower the man, even if we considered
A06 0190  7    him a mediocre president ... but there is nothing left
A06 0200  5    of the Republican Party without his leadership".
A06 0210  1       Mitchell said the statement should become a major
A06 0210  9    issue in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can
A06 0220 10    a man with any degree of common decency charge this"?
A06 0230  6    he asked. The former secretary of labor said he was
A06 0240  6    proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud to
A06 0250  2    have absorbed his philosophy" while working in his
A06 0250 10    adminstration.
A06 0260  1       Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last
A06 0260 10    fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower
A06 0270  8    Republicanism was a dead issue.
A06 0280  5    #REGRETS ATTACK#
A06 0280  7    Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal
A06 0290  5    attack on a past president. "He is wrong to inject
A06 0300  2    Eisenhower into this campaign", he said, "because the
A06 0300 10    primary is being waged on state issues and I will not
A06 0310 11    be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign".
A06 0320  5       The audience last night did not respond with either
A06 0330  5    applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.
A06 0340  1       Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary.
A06 0340 11    He then launched into what the issues should be in
A06 0350 10    the campaign. State aid to schools, the continuance
A06 0360  6    of railroad passenger service, the proper uses of surplus
A06 0370  4    funds of the Port of New York Authority, and making
A06 0380  2    New Jersey attractive to new industry.
A06 0380  8    #DECRIES JOBLESSNESS#
A06 0390  1    Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the
A06 0390 10    state and said the Meyner administration and the
A06 0400  6    Republican-controlled
A06 0400  8    State Senate "Must share the blame for this". Nothing
A06 0410  8    that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co.
A06 0420  9    plant, he said industry will not come into this state
A06 0430  6    until there is tax reform.
A06 0430 11       "But I am not in favor of a sales or state income
A06 0440 12    tax at this time", Mitchell said.
A06 0450  2       Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited
A06 0450  9    to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions,
A06 0460 10    saved his barbs for Mitchell. He said Mitchell is against
A06 0470  8    the centralization of government in Washington but
A06 0480  4    looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet
A06 0490  4    New Jersey school and transportation crises.
A06 0490 10       "He calls for help while saying he is against centralization,
A06 0500 10    but you can't have it both ways", Jones said. The state
A06 0510 10    is now faced with the immediate question of raising
A06 0520  6    new taxes whether on utilities, real estate or motor
A06 0530  4    vehicles, he said, "and I challenge Mitchell to tell
A06 0540  2    the people where he stands on the tax issue".
A06 0540 11    #DEFENDS IKE#
A06 0550  1    Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement:
A06 0550  7       "I think that all Americans will resent deeply the
A06 0560  6    statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard
A06 0570  4    J. Hughes. His reference to 'discredited carcass' or
A06 0580  3    'tattered remains' of the president's leadership is
A06 0590  2    an insult to the man who led our forces to victory
A06 0590 13    in the greatest war in all history, to the man who
A06 0600  9    was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people
A06 0610  4    as president of the United States, and who has been
A06 0620  2    the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions
A06 0620 12    of the free nations.
A06 0630  2       "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking
A06 0640  1    a position in public life could demonstrate such poor
A06 0640 10    judgment and bad taste.
A06 0650  3       "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin
A06 0660  1    in the desire of a new political candidate to try to
A06 0660 12    make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
A06 0670  8    It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit".
A06 0680  3    #SEES JONES AHEAD#
A06 0680  6    Sen. Charles W. Sandman, R-Cape May, said today Jones
A06 0690  8    will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial
A06 0700  8    nomination. Sandman, state campaign chairman for Jones,
A06 0710  6    was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel,
A06 0720  4    Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign managers
A06 0730  2    for Jones.
A06 0730  4       Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers
A06 0740  3    on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones
A06 0750  1    will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with
A06 0750  9    the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.
A06 0760  7       Sandman said: "The announcement that Sen. Clifford
A06 0770  5    Case R-N.J., has decided to spend all his available
A06 0780  6    time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway.
A06 0790  5    It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate
A06 0800  1    who has proven he cannot answer any questions about
A06 0800 10    New Jersey's problems.
A06 0810  2       "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to
A06 0820  2    project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate
A06 0820 12    from Washington. That failed.
A06 0830  4       "We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to
A06 0840  4    Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy
A06 0850  2    of last year. That, too, will fail".
A06 0850  9       Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet
A06 0860  6    Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave., Westfield,
A06 0870  4    as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones
A06 0880  4    Committee.
A06 0880  5       Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's
A06 0890  5    Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman.
A06 0910  1       County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets, who is a candidate
A06 0910 10    for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today
A06 0920  6    called for an end to paper ballots in those counties
A06 0930  6    in the state which still use them. The proposal, Sheets
A06 0940  3    said, represents part of his program for election reforms
A06 0950  2    necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than
A06 0950 11    a "lip service word".
A06 0960  3       Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state
A06 0970  2    financing aid for the purchase of voting machines,
A06 0970 10    enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year
A06 0980 10    period without interest or charge. Sheets added that
A06 0990  4    he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in
A06 1000  2    the state by January, 1964.
A06 1000  7       Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation
A06 1010  4    impinging on home rule is basically distasteful, he
A06 1020  2    added that the vital interest in election results transcended
A06 1030  1    county lines.
A06 1040  1       The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West
A06 1040 10    Orange, for the Republican nomination for sheriff of
A06 1060  2    Essex County, was supported today by Edward W. Roos,
A06 1070  6    West Orange public safety commissioner.
A06 1080  1       Sheeran, a lawyer and former FBI man is running
A06 1090  1    against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder
A06 1090  7    William MacDonald, for the vacancy left by the resignation
A06 1100  9    of Neil Duffy, now a member of the State Board of Tax
A06 1110 10    Appeals.
A06 1110 11       "My experience as public safety commissioner", Roos
A06 1120  7    said, "has shown me that the office of sheriff is best
A06 1130  9    filled by a man with law enforcement experience, and
A06 1140  3    preferably one who is a lawyer. Jim Sheeran fits that
A06 1150  2    description".
A06 1160  1    _TRENTON_
A06 1160  1       - William J. Seidel, state fire warden in the Department
A06 1170  1    of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired
A06 1170  8    after 36 years of service.
A06 1180  5       A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore
A06 1190  2    A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction
A06 1200  1    in the number of forest fires in the state.
A06 1200 10       Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division
A06 1210  7    fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University
A06 1220  4    of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment
A06 1230  1    with private lumber companies. In October 1944, he
A06 1230  9    was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest
A06 1240  8    Fire Section.
A06 1240 10       Under his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency
A06 1250  8    developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines
A06 1260  6    and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor
A06 1270  3    units for fire fighting.
A06 1270  7       He also expanded and modernized the radio system
A06 1280  4    with a central control station. He introduced regular
A06 1290  2    briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first
A06 1290 10    aid training for section wardens. He is credited with
A06 1300  8    setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program
A06 1310  6    in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department
A06 1320  4    of Education.
A06 1330  1    _BOONTON_
A06 1330  1       - Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut
A06 1340  1    in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
A06 1340  9    here last night with a pledge "to carry the issues
A06 1350  8    to every corner of the state".
A06 1360  1       He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee
A06 1360  8    members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn: "When
A06 1370  9    I come back here after the November election you'll
A06 1380  6    think, 'You're my man- you're the kind of governor
A06 1390  6    we're glad we elected'".
A06 1390 10       He said, "We Democrats must resolve our issues on
A06 1400  9    the test of what is right and just, and not what is
A06 1410  9    expedient at the time".
A06 1410 13    #ATTACKS REPUBLICANS#
A06 1420  2    In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said,
A06 1430  1    "The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping
A06 1430  9    over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
A06 1440 10    But we'll have a liberal, well planned, forward looking,
A06 1450  7    honest platform. We'll not talk out of one side of
A06 1460  7    our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side
A06 1470  3    in Hudson.
A06 1470  5       "We'll take the truth to the people, and the people
A06 1480  4    will like the truth and elect their candidate and party
A06 1490  1    in November".
A06 1490  3       He said, "You can see signs of the Republicans'
A06 1500  1    feeble attack on the Meyner administration. But I shall
A06 1510  1    campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of
A06 1510 11    the years ahead".
A06 1520  1       He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in
A06 1520 11    the courageous actions of President Kennedy". He called
A06 1530  7    for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to
A06 1540  8    the piracy of industry by Southern states, and a strong
A06 1550  5    fight against discrimination in business and industry.
A06 1560  2       "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean",
A06 1570  1    the former Superior Court judge said. "To prevent hoodlums
A06 1580  1    from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican
A06 1580 11    administration in the early 1940s".
A06 1590  5       Calling the Democrats the "party that lives, breathes
A06 1600  4    and thinks for the good of the people", Hughes asked,
A06 1610  2    "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for
A06 1610 10    a springboard toward victory in November".
A06 1620  5       Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's "Green Acres" plan
A06 1630  5    for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush
A06 1640  5    of urban development. He said legislation for a $60
A06 1650  3    million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected
A06 1650 12    to be introduced Monday.
A06 1660  3    #CONSERVATION PLAN#
A06 1660  5    The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open
A06 1670  6    land by the state. The other $15 million is to be alloted
A06 1680  5    to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
A06 1690  1       Hughes said, "This is not a plan to conquer space-
A06 1690 10    but to conserve it", pointing out the state population
A06 1700  7    has increased 125,000 each year since 1950. He said
A06 1710  6    "Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps
A06 1720  3    are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be
A06 1720 13    no land left to preserve".
A06 1730  4       Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other
A06 1740  3    issues in which the Republican candidates are involved.
A06 1740 11    He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued
A06 1750 12    that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the
A06 1760 10    Republicans. "After the primary", he promised, "I'll
A06 1770  5    be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong,
A06 1780  5    dynamic administration. I'm not afraid to tangle with
A06 1790  2    the Republican nominee".
A06 1800  1    _TRENTON_
A06 1800  1       - Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee
A06 1810  1    who are retiring- voluntarily- this year were honored
A06 1810  9    yesterday by their colleagues.
A06 1820  3       The outgoing members, whose four-year terms will
A06 1830  2    expire a week after the April 18 primary election,
A06 1830 11    received carved wooden elephants, complete with ivory
A06 1840  6    tusks, to remember the state committee by.
A06 1850  3       There may be other 1961 state committee retirements
A06 1860  1    come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of
A06 1860 12    the Republican voters.
A06 1870  2       A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine
A06 1880  1    Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35
A06 1880 11    years on the committee. She also was the original GOP
A06 1890  9    national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early
A06 1900  7    1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment.
A06 1910  3    She served one four-year term on the national committee.
