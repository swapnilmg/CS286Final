A04 0010  1    _OSLO_
A04 0010  2       The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo
A04 0010 11    meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign
A04 0020  7    Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions,
A04 0030  7    animated by much better mutual understanding than in
A04 0040  4    past meetings.
A04 0040  6       This has been a working session of an organization
A04 0050  5    that, by its very nature, can only proceed along its
A04 0060  3    route step by step and without dramatic changes. In
A04 0060 12    Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor,
A04 0070 10    and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding
A04 0080  7    one another's problems.
A04 0090  1       This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly
A04 0090  8    noticeable where relations are concerned between the
A04 0100  7    "colonialist" powers and those who have never, or not
A04 0110  8    for a long time, had such problems. The nightmare of
A04 0120  4    a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated
A04 0130  1    by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing
A04 0130  8    them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally
A04 0140  6    disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these
A04 0150  5    troubles about, has been conspicious by its absence.
A04 0160  3    #EXPLOSION AVOIDED#
A04 0160  5    In the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was
A04 0170  6    rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should
A04 0180  2    critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has
A04 0180 11    been a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general,
A04 0190  8    remarkably courteous, explanation has left basic positions
A04 0200  6    unchanged, but there has been no explosion in the council.
A04 0210  6    There should even be no more bitter surprises in the
A04 0220  3    UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes, since
A04 0230  2    a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that
A04 0240  1    in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed
A04 0240 11    in advance.
A04 0250  1       Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with
A04 0250 10    the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on
A04 0260  9    the track behind the NATO locomotive. Even Norway,
A04 0270  4    despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic
A04 0280  2    arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the
A04 0280 12    alliance, is today closer to the NATO line.
A04 0290  8       On the negative side of the balance sheet must be
A04 0300  8    set some disappointment that the United States leadership
A04 0310  4    has not been as much in evidence as hoped for. One
A04 0320  2    diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State
A04 0320 10    Dean Rusk's speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened
A04 0330  7    to add that, if United States policies were not always
A04 0340  8    clear, despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global
A04 0350  6    danger points and setbacks for the West, this may merely
A04 0360  5    mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed
A04 0370  2    its policy.
A04 0370  4    #EXPLORATORY MOOD#
A04 0370  6    A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical
A04 0380  5    appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting
A04 0390  2    is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet
A04 0390 12    correspondents accredited.
A04 0400  2       The impression has nevertheless been given during
A04 0410  3    these three days, despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity,
A04 0420  1    that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a
A04 0420 11    somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more
A04 0430  8    ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy
A04 0440  6    on a global scale with detailed application to individual
A04 0450  3    danger spots.
A04 0450  5       The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech,
A04 0460  6    gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside
A04 0470  3    and outside the United States that has preoccupied
A04 0470 11    the new administration in the past four months.
A04 0480  8       But where the core of NATO is concerned, the Secretary
A04 0490  7    of State has not only reiterated the United States'
A04 0500  5    profound attachment to the alliance, "cornerstone"
A04 0510  2    of its foreign policy, but has announced that five
A04 0520  1    nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal
A04 0520  9    in European waters.
A04 0530  3       The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated
A04 0540  1    a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States
A04 0540 11    will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation
A04 0550 10    once again taken up by the council as a whole.
A04 0560  8    #CONFLICT SURVEYED#
A04 0560 10    The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the
A04 0570  6    rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction,
A04 0580  5    wherever it take place around the globe, is in essence
A04 0590  5    the general conflict between two entirely different
A04 0600  1    societies, and must be treated as such without regard
A04 0600 10    to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
A04 0610  7       The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in
A04 0620  7    three main directions: more, deeper, and more timely
A04 0630  4    political consultation within the alliance, the use
A04 0640  1    of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
A04 0640  9    (when ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to
A04 0650  9    the underdeveloped countries, and the need for strengthening
A04 0660  6    conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the
A04 0670  4    nuclear deterrent.
A04 0670  6       This increase in the "threshold", as the conventional
A04 0680  5    forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the
A04 0690  5    alliance's most difficult problems in the months to
A04 0700  2    come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations
A04 0700 11    long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.
A04 0720  1    _WASHINGTON_
A04 0720  2       The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward
A04 0720  8    a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate
A04 0730  9    over its foreign policy erupts for the first time.
A04 0740  6       There is little optimism here that the Communists
A04 0750  4    will be any more docile at the conference table than
A04 0760  2    they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.
A04 0760 12       The United States, State Department officials explain,
A04 0770  7    now is mainly interested in setting up an international
A04 0780  7    inspection system which will prevent Laos from being
A04 0790  5    used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring
A04 0800  1    Thailand and South Viet Nam.
A04 0800  6       They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending
A04 0810  6    the Geneva conference to achieve this.
A04 0820  2       The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet
A04 0830  1    would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent
A04 0830 10    that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent
A04 0840  7    such a possibility.
A04 0840 10    #POLICIES MODIFIED#
A04 0850  2    The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire
A04 0860  1    in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification
A04 0860 11    of the cease-fire by the international control commission
A04 0870  8    before participating in the Geneva conference.
A04 0880  5       This is another of the modifications of policy on
A04 0890  4    Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled
A04 0900  1    to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain
A04 0900 11    reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.
A04 0910  8       Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time
A04 0920  8    enough to institute reforms in military and economic
A04 0930  4    aid policies in the critical areas.
A04 0930 10       But with the months moving on- and the immediate
A04 0940  9    confrontations with the Communists showing no gain
A04 0950  5    for the free world- the question arises:
A04 0960  1       How effective have Kennedy administration first
A04 0960  7    foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist
A04 0970  7    aggression?
A04 0980  1       Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit
A04 0980  8    called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet
A04 0990  8    Union. He was critical of what he feels is President
A04 1000  7    Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.
A04 1010  1    #GOP RESTRAINED#
A04 1010  3    It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most
A04 1020  5    Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation
A04 1030  2    as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves
A04 1040  1    from raising the question of whether Republicans, if
A04 1040  9    they had been in power, would have made "amateurish
A04 1050  7    and monumental blunders" in Cuba.
A04 1060  2       One Republican senator told this correspondent that
A04 1060  9    he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack
A04 1070  9    the Kennedy administration on this score. His reply,
A04 1080  6    he said, was that he agreed to the need for unity in
A04 1090  5    the country now. But he further said that it was better
A04 1100  2    politics to let others question the wisdom of administration
A04 1100 11    policies first.
A04 1110  2       The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through
A04 1120  1    Senator Thruston B. Morton (R) of Kentucky, chairman
A04 1130  1    of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy
A04 1130  9    administration would be held responsible if the outcome
A04 1140  8    in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist
A04 1150  5    domination.
A04 1150  6       Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed
A04 1160  6    now from another direction by 70 Harvard, Boston University,
A04 1170  6    Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
A04 1180  3    educators.
A04 1180  4    #DETENTE URGED#
A04 1180  6    This group pleads with the administration to "give
A04 1190  6    no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile
A04 1200  5    groups". It recommends that the United States "seek
A04 1210  2    instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist
A04 1210 11    bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption
A04 1220 10    of trade relations; and concentrate its constructive
A04 1230  5    efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America
A04 1240  5    the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism
A04 1250  2    feeds".
A04 1250  3       Mr. Nixon, for his part, would oppose intervention
A04 1260  2    in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend
A04 1270  1    that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist
A04 1270  9    countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it
A04 1280  9    would not be tolerated.
A04 1290  1       Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military
A04 1290  9    victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said
A04 1300  7    that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected,
A04 1310  5    generally, the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and
A04 1320  4    the professors.
A04 1320  6    #AID PLANS REVAMPED#
A04 1320  9    Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin
A04 1330  8    through diplomatic channels, a high official source
A04 1340  5    disclosed, that the new administration would react
A04 1350  3    even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would
A04 1350 10    during the formative period of the administration.
A04 1360  7       Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking
A04 1370  7    from administration statements. Policies on nuclear
A04 1380  3    test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But
A04 1390  1    thus far there has been no response in kind.
A04 1390 10       Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater
A04 1400  6    emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political
A04 1410  3    reform in recipient nations.
A04 1410  7       In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower
A04 1420  6    administration efforts to show determination by sailing
A04 1430  4    a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless
A04 1440  4    gesture.
A04 1440  5       Again and again it asked the Communists to "freeze"
A04 1450  3    the military situation in Laos. But the Communists
A04 1460  1    aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.
A04 1460 10       And after several correspondents went into Pathet
A04 1470  5    Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up, administration
A04 1490  2    spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a "great service"
A04 1500  3    and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty
A04 1510  1    Organization.
A04 1510  2       SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans
A04 1520  3    for coping with the military losses in Laos. But the
A04 1530  2    Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any
A04 1530  9    one time for the United States to want to risk a limited
A04 1540 10    or an all-out war over Laos. (Some SEATO nations disagreed,
A04 1550  5    however.)
A04 1550  6       There was the further complication that the administration
A04 1560  8    had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to
A04 1570  7    be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand
A04 1580  3    and South Viet Nam.
A04 1580  7       The administration declared itself in favor of a
A04 1590  7    neutralized Laos. The pro-Western government, which
A04 1600  3    the United States had helped in a revolt against the
A04 1610  2    Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did
A04 1610  8    appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao
A04 1620 10    Army.
A04 1620 11       There certainly was not any more energy displayed
A04 1630  8    after it was clear the United States would not back
A04 1640  5    the pro-Western government to the hilt.
A04 1650  1       If the administration ever had any ideas that it
A04 1650 10    could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna
A04 1660  6    Phouma, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists,
A04 1670  5    it gradually had to relinquish them.
A04 1680  1       One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright
A04 1680 11    (D) of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
A04 1690  9    Committee. He declared on March 25 that the United
A04 1700  9    States had erred a year and a half ago by "encouraging
A04 1710  8    the removal" of Prince Souvanna.
A04 1730  1    _WASHINGTON_
A04 1730  2       The White House is taking extraordinary steps to
A04 1730 10    check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the
A04 1740  9    United States.
A04 1750  1       The President is deeply concerned over this problem
A04 1750  9    and its effect upon the "vitality of the nation".
A04 1760  7       In an important assertion of national leadership
A04 1770  4    in this field, he has issued an executive order establishing
A04 1780  3    the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and
A04 1790  2    Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory
A04 1800  1    Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
A04 1800  8       The President asks the support and cooperation of
A04 1810  8    Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation
A04 1820  6    to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts
A04 1830  5    in combating this disturbing crime trend.
A04 1840  1    #OFFENSES MULTIPLY#
A04 1840  3    The President has also called upon the Attorney General,
A04 1850  2    the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and
A04 1860  1    the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts
A04 1860  9    "in the development of a program of federal leadership
A04 1870  7    to assist states and local communities in their efforts
A04 1880  5    to cope with the problem.
A04 1880 10       Simultaneously the President announced Thursday
A04 1890  5    the appointment of David L. Hackett, a special assistant
A04 1900  5    ot the Attorney General, as executive director of the
A04 1910  4    new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.
A04 1920  2       His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the
A04 1930  1    fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more
A04 1930 10    than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase
A04 1940  7    in offenders.
A04 1940  9       Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of
A04 1950  7    Investigation in 1959, about half for burglary and
A04 1960  5    larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
