E07 0010  1    THE design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much
E07 0010 10    like a mechanical puzzle, but once understood, the
E07 0020  6    principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement.
E07 0030  6    In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with
E07 0040  4    each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous
E07 0050  1    moves. The main set of bars are the "tappets" and one
E07 0050 12    tappet is connected to each lever. If the lever is
E07 0060 10    pulled to clear a signal or move a switch, the tappet
E07 0070  7    moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time.
E07 0080  4       Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking
E07 0090  1    bars. These can also move a short distance but at right
E07 0090 12    angles to the tappets. The number of locking bars required
E07 0100 10    depends on how many false moves must be prevented.
E07 0110  6       In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping
E07 0120  5    sides, and connection between the tappets and locking
E07 0130  2    bars consist of cams called "dogs". Two or more dogs
E07 0130 12    are mounted on each locking bar. These slide into and
E07 0140 10    out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are
E07 0150  8    moved, locking and unlocking them.
E07 0160  1       Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator
E07 0160  9    pulls the lever to clear a particular signal. This
E07 0170  9    also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever
E07 0180  5    and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side,
E07 0190  4    thus moving one or more locking bars. The dogs on the
E07 0200  1    other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into
E07 0200 11    notches in other tappets. By this scheme, pulling one
E07 0210  7    signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal
E07 0220  5    levers in safe positions until the first signal is
E07 0230  2    again restored to normal.
E07 0230  6       Interlocking signals are normally at stop or "red"
E07 0240  5    position, and a lever must be pulled to "clear" the
E07 0250  2    signal. This is not necessarily to green, however,
E07 0250 10    for in some situations only a yellow indication is
E07 0260  8    given to a train to let it into the "plant".
E07 0270  4       There are other basic rules. A turnout may have
E07 0280  3    two levers, one to actually move the switch points,
E07 0280 12    the other to lock the points. A signal cannot be cleared
E07 0290 10    until all the related turnouts are properly thrown
E07 0300  5    and locked. Such locks are nearly always used where
E07 0310  4    the switch points "face" oncoming traffic. The lock
E07 0320  2    insures that the points are thrown all the way with
E07 0320 12    no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly
E07 0330  9    thrown point. If the points aren't thrown all the way,
E07 0340  5    the turnout cannot be locked, and in turn, the signal
E07 0350  3    cannot be cleared. Generally, these locks on turnouts
E07 0350 11    are called "facing point locks".
E07 0360  5       Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and
E07 0370  4    signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog chart",
E07 0380  2    a list of the levers that show which other levers any
E07 0380 13    particular lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting
E07 0390  9    the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at
E07 0400  7    right angles to the tappet bars.
E07 0410  1       By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note
E07 0410  9    several other details. Derails- mechanical track devices
E07 0420  7    that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train
E07 0430  9    passes a "stop" signal- are used in many instances.
E07 0440  5    "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in blades
E07 0450  2    indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As
E07 0460  1    an engineer approaches the plant the position of the
E07 0460 10    home signal is seen in advance when he passes the "distant"
E07 0470 10    signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking
E07 0480  7    plant. In some low-speed situations, the distant signal
E07 0490  4    is fixed at caution. In other instances where there
E07 0500  2    is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only
E07 0500 11    green and yellow aspects.
E07 0510  4       So much for the prototype.
E07 0510  9       The interlocking frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER
E07 0520  8    workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad
E07 0530  6    follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in
E07 0540  6    Fig. 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's how it can
E07 0550  4    be built.
E07 0550  6    #FRAME#
E07 0550  7    The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame
E07 0560  5    are shown in the notes within Fig. 7, most of the bars
E07 0570  4    being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths. You may
E07 0580  3    change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer
E07 0580 14    levers and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume
E07 0590  9    you are building this particular frame, which is for
E07 0600  7    a junction.
E07 0600  9       When cutting the pieces, dress the ends smooth,
E07 0610  7    and square with a smooth file or sanding disk. Start
E07 0620  3    with the right-hand piece "B", **f, soldering it to
E07 0630  3    the lower piece "A" of the same material but 12''
E07 0640  1    long. Let exactly 1'' of "A" extend beyond "B" and
E07 0650  1    use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.
E07 0650 12       Now lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by
E07 0660 12    side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material
E07 0670  8    1/2'' sq. This gives you the spacing for locating
E07 0680  4    the left-hand piece "B". Compress the assembly when
E07 0690  2    you make the mark to show the location for "B". Solder
E07 0700  1    this second "B" to "A" at right angles. There should
E07 0710  2    be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should
E07 0710 12    be 1'' from an end of the long piece.
E07 0720  9       Cap this assembly (with spacing bars in place) with
E07 0730  6    a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2'' sq. pieces to
E07 0740  4    the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled and
E07 0750  2    tapped later on.
E07 0750  5       Now cut five **f locking bar spacers (which run
E07 0760  3    horizontally). Position these using six intermediate
E07 0760  9    temporary **f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar
E07 0770  9    "A". Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to
E07 0780  9    the frame. Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' sq. on this edge
E07 0790  6    as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' long
E07 0800  5    "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f bar and
E07 0810  3    tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with
E07 0810 13    two **f directly under the first two "B" pieces. Remove
E07 0820 10    all the loose spacing bars.
E07 0830  4       Mark and center-punch all the holes required for
E07 0840  2    screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig. 7.
E07 0840 11    Placement of these holes is not critical, but they
E07 0850  9    should be located so that the centers are about 1/8''
E07 0860  6    from any edge. Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all
E07 0870  4    except the "A" pieces size 43. Tap the "A" pieces
E07 0880  2    2-56.
E07 0880  4       Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for
E07 0890  3    the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("A" and
E07 0900  2    "B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay
E07 0910  1    the components aside in proper order or code them with
E07 0910 11    numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their
E07 0920  8    proper positions. Dress all surfaces with a file, cleaning
E07 0930  5    off all solder and drilling burrs.
E07 0940  1       Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece "A" as
E07 0940 12    shown in Fig. 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical
E07 0950 11    contact later on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require
E07 0960 10    holes for contacts.
E07 0970  1       Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel
E07 0970  9    screws and nuts. Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking
E07 0980  9    bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components
E07 0990  6    before you tighten the screws. Be sure the tappets
E07 1000  3    are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq. spacer. As an
E07 1010  2    anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the
E07 1010 13    lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7.
E07 1020  9    Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with
E07 1030  6    a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No. 50 holes, one in
E07 1040  4    the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly
E07 1050  1    above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars
E07 1050 12    before removing them so they can be replaced in the
E07 1060  8    same slots. Remove all other loose pieces and file
E07 1070  4    the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces
E07 1080  1    of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting
E07 1080 12    members for the short locking bars. Locate their positions
E07 1090  9    in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding
E07 1100  8    holes in the frame. Cut off excess screw lengths and
E07 1110  5    file flush with either frame or nut. Drill four No.
E07 1120  3    19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12'' long "A" pieces.
E07 1130  2    Locate the position from Fig. 7.
E07 1130  8    #TAPPETS AND LOCKING BARS#
E07 1140  2    Draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective
E07 1150  1    slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with
E07 1150 11    a slight 45 degree chamfer. Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4''
E07 1160  9    from one end and tap 2-56. (See Fig. 7.) Put a 2-56
E07 1170 10    roundhead screw into the hole, cut off the excess threads
E07 1180  5    and file flush with the underside of the bar. To find
E07 1190  3    the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into
E07 1190 12    the frame and hold the screw head tight against the
E07 1200  9    frame edge. Scribe a line across the bar on the other
E07 1210  7    end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the diameter of
E07 1220  3    the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame
E07 1230  1    edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make
E07 1230 10    this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the
E07 1240  8    screw head to get exactly 1/4'' tappet movement. Drill
E07 1250  5    a No. 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56
E07 1260  5    screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No. 47 hole
E07 1270  3    crosswise through the tappet at the position shown
E07 1270 11    in Figs. 7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations
E07 1280 10    for each of the tappet bars.
E07 1290  2       To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece
E07 1290 13    of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs.
E07 1300 11    6 and 8. These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical
E07 1310  9    contacts.
E07 1310 10       Fitting the locking bars and making the locking
E07 1320  8    pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws, tappets
E07 1330  5    and locking bars must be removed and replaced many
E07 1340  2    times. As the work progresses the frame and moving
E07 1340 11    parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several
E07 1350  8    pieces must be removed before the part you are working
E07 1360  6    on is accessible. A little extra work here will pay
E07 1370  4    off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are
E07 1370 14    finished. Each completed locking bar should remain
E07 1380  7    in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting.
E07 1390  6       The order of fitting is not too important. However,
E07 1400  4    we started with the first row of bars and worked our
E07 1410  2    way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting
E07 1410 12    the dogs and notches is used throughout, we will only
E07 1420  9    describe the construction of one locking bar. Figs.
E07 1430  6    7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions. All the bars
E07 1440  4    are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are
E07 1450  1    listed at the bottom of Fig. 7. Bar "C" is 2-3/4''
E07 1450 13    long. Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put
E07 1460 11    a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag
E07 1470  9    in the frame.
E07 1470 12       Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin
E07 1480  8    holes. Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16''
E07 1490  6    from one end of the bar. Chuck a length of 1/8'' dia.
E07 1500  4    drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning
E07 1510  1    device and while it is rotating file the end square
E07 1510 11    and then file a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece
E07 1520  9    about 9/32'' or 5/16'' long and drive it into the No.
E07 1530  8    31 hole drilled in the locking bar. File the bottom
E07 1540  5    edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' above the
E07 1550  3    bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet
E07 1550 15    3.
E07 1560  1       Place the locking bar in proper position and insert
E07 1560 10    tappet 3. Scribe a line through the center of the pin
E07 1570 10    and across the face of tappet 3, parallel to piece
E07 1580  6    "A". See the drawings for the shape of the notch.
E07 1590  4    Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with
E07 1600  2    either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power
E07 1600 14    tool. We used the latter equipped with a carborundum
E07 1610  7    disk about .020'' thick and 1'' dia. fitted on a 1/8''
E07 1620  7    dia. mandrel. Such disks are very handy for cutting
E07 1630  5    and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish. A
E07 1640  2    Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular
E07 1650  1    shape with only one cutting face will allow you to
E07 1650 11    work a surface without marring an adjoining one. Endeavor
E07 1660  6    to get the notches as much alike as possible. The notch
E07 1670  5    should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will
E07 1680  3    slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame
E07 1680 13    and test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All
E07 1690 10    matching surfaces should be checked frequently and
E07 1700  6    mated on a cut and fit basis.
E07 1710  1       Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia. drill rod
E07 1710 12    in a drill press or electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp
E07 1730  7    scribing point about 3/64'' long on one end, using
E07 1740  6    Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be made with
E07 1750  3    a lathe.
