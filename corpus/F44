F44 0010  1    In general, religious interest seems to exist in all
F44 0010 10    parts of the metropolis; congregational membership,
F44 0020  3    however, is another thing. A congregation survives
F44 0030  2    only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;
F44 0040  1    that is, when it can preserve economic integration.
F44 0040  9    Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition
F44 0050  8    of membership in a congregation, since the decision
F44 0060  6    to join a worshiping group requires some motive force,
F44 0070  4    but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining;
F44 0080  1    the presence of other members of similar social and
F44 0080 10    economic level is the sufficient condition.
F44 0090  6       The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city
F44 0100  5    areas and the spread of inner city blight account for
F44 0110  2    the decline of central city churches. Central cities
F44 0110 10    reveal two adverse features for the major denominations:
F44 0120  8    (1) central cities tend to be areas of residence for
F44 0130  8    lower social classes; (2) central cities tend to be
F44 0140  5    more heterogeneous in social composition. The central
F44 0150  1    city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics
F44 0150 10    which violate the life principle of congregations of
F44 0160  8    the major denominations: they have too few middle-class
F44 0170  7    people; they mix middle-class people with lower-class
F44 0180  4    residents. Central city areas have become progressively
F44 0190  1    poorer locales for the major denominations since the
F44 0190  9    exodus of middle-class people from most central cities.
F44 0200  9    With few exceptions, the major denominations are rapidly
F44 0210  6    losing their hold on the central city.
F44 0220  2       The key to Protestant development, therefore, is
F44 0220  9    economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation.
F44 0230  8    Members of higher and lower social status often cluster
F44 0240  7    around this nucleus, so that Protestant figures on
F44 0250  3    social class give the impression of spread over all
F44 0260  1    social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core
F44 0260 10    of membership is concentrated in a single social and
F44 0270  7    economic stratum. The congregation perishes when it
F44 0280  4    is no longer possible to replenish that core from the
F44 0290  1    neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so
F44 0290  7    high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit
F44 0300  7    constantly in their core stratum in order to survive;
F44 0310  5    they can lose higher- and lower-status members from
F44 0320  2    the church without collapsing, but they need adequate
F44 0320 10    recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve
F44 0330  9    economic integration. The congregation is first and
F44 0340  5    foremost an economic peer group; it is secondarily
F44 0350  2    a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily
F44 0360  1    a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers
F44 0360  8    from all social and economic ranks, something which
F44 0370  6    most congregations of the New Protestantism (with a
F44 0380  3    few notable exceptions) have not been able to do. They
F44 0390  2    survive only when they can recruit social and economic
F44 0390 11    peers.
F44 0400  1       The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to
F44 0400  7    social differences has often been attributed to the
F44 0410  7    "folksy spirit" of Protestant religious life; in fact,
F44 0420  5    a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the "impersonal"
F44 0430  4    Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that the folksy
F44 0440  3    spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently,
F44 0440 10    the vulnerability to social difference should not be
F44 0450  8    attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant
F44 0460  6    congregations; actually, there is little evidence of
F44 0470  5    such personal community in Protestant congregations,
F44 0480  1    as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability
F44 0480 10    of Protestantism to social differences stems from the
F44 0490  8    peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class
F44 0500  8    life, where the congregation is a vehicle of social
F44 0510  5    and economic group identity and must conform, therefore,
F44 0520  1    to the principle of economic integration. This fact
F44 0520  9    is evident in the recruitment of new members.
F44 0530  7    #MISSION AS CO-OPTATION#
F44 0530 11    The rule of economic integration in congregational
F44 0540  7    life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the
F44 0550  5    major denominations. There is much talk in theological
F44 0560  3    circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's
F44 0570  1    Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact
F44 0570  8    that the Church does not exist for its own sake but
F44 0580 11    as a testimony in the world for the healing of the
F44 0590  8    world. A crucial question, therefore, is what evangelism
F44 0600  4    and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism.
F44 0610  1    If economic integration really shapes congregational
F44 0610  7    life, then evangelism should be a process of extending
F44 0620  8    economic integration. The task of a congregation would
F44 0630  7    be defined, according to economic integration, as the
F44 0640  3    work of co-opting individuals and families of similar
F44 0650  1    social and economic position to replenish the nuclear
F44 0650  9    core of the congregation. (Co-optation means to choose
F44 0660  6    by joint action in order to fill a vacancy; it can
F44 0670  6    also mean the assimilation of centers of power from
F44 0680  2    an environment in order to strengthen an organization.)
F44 0680 10    In a mobile society, congregational health depends
F44 0690  6    on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment,
F44 0700  4    however, must follow the pattern of economic integration
F44 0710  3    or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the
F44 0720  2    recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation
F44 0720  9    will be co-optation rather than proclamation- like
F44 0730  5    elements will have to be assimilated.
F44 0740  1       Evangelism and congregational outreach have not
F44 0740  7    been carefully studied in the churches; one study in
F44 0750  9    Pittsburgh, however, has illuminated the situation.
F44 0760  5    In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches,
F44 0770  2    almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts
F44 0780  1    with friendly members". If we add to these contacts
F44 0780 10    with friendly members the "contacts with an organization
F44 0790  7    of the church" (11.2 per cent of the cases), then a
F44 0800  8    substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through
F44 0810  3    friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound
F44 0820  1    approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation
F44 0820  9    show by their friendly attitudes that they care for
F44 0830  8    new people; the new people respond in kind by joining
F44 0840  6    the church.
F44 0840  8       Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat
F44 0850  6    different when one reflects on what is known about
F44 0860  4    friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the
F44 0860 10    majority of such contacts are with people of similar
F44 0870  9    social and economic position; association by level
F44 0880  5    of achievement is the dominant principle of informal
F44 0890  3    relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation
F44 0900  1    are extended into the community, picking up the wave
F44 0900 10    lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic
F44 0910 11    level of the congregation; the mission of the church
F44 0920  6    is actually a process of informal co-optation; the
F44 0930  4    lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people
F44 0940  1    who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the
F44 0940 10    congregation. Churches can be strengthened through
F44 0950  6    this process of co-optation so long as the environs
F44 0960  4    of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who
F44 0970  2    can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the
F44 0970 11    pool of recruits diminishes, the congregation is helpless-
F44 0980  6    friendly contacts no longer keep it going.
F44 0990  5       The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further
F44 1000  3    indicated by the insignificance of educational activities,
F44 1010  1    worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.
F44 1010  9    The proclamation of the churches is almost totally
F44 1020  8    confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy (17.3 per
F44 1030  6    cent of new members) and friendly contacts by members
F44 1040  3    (over two thirds if organizational activities are included).
F44 1050  1    Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial
F44 1050 10    contacts with new members. In general, friendly contact
F44 1060  7    with a member followed by contact with a clergyman
F44 1070  5    will account for a major share of recruitment by the
F44 1080  3    churches, making it quite evident that the extension
F44 1080 11    of economic integration through co-optation is the
F44 1090  7    principal form of mission in the contemporary church;
F44 1100  5    economic integration and co-optation are the two methods
F44 1110  4    by which Protestants associate with and recruit from
F44 1120  1    the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will
F44 1120  9    prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social
F44 1130  8    and economic level can fraternize together; the outer
F44 1140  4    life of congregations- the suitability of the environment
F44 1150  4    to their survival- will be propitious so long as the
F44 1160  2    people in the area are of the same social and economic
F44 1160 13    level as the membership. Economic integration ceases
F44 1170  5    when the social and economic statuses in an area become
F44 1180  6    too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation.
F44 1190  3    In a rapidly changing society congregations will run
F44 1200  1    into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances
F44 1200  8    of economic integration are hard to sustain in the
F44 1210  7    metropolis for more than a single generation. The fact
F44 1220  4    that metropolitan churches of the major denominations
F44 1230  1    have moved approximately every generation for the last
F44 1230  9    hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in
F44 1240  7    the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance.
F44 1250  5    The expense of this type of organization in religious
F44 1260  3    life, when one recalls the number of city churches
F44 1260 12    which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned,
F44 1270  7    raises fundamental questions about the principle of
F44 1280  6    Protestant survival in a mobile society; nonetheless,
F44 1290  3    the prevalence of economic integration in congregations
F44 1300  1    illumines the nature of the Protestant development.
F44 1310  1       It was observed in the introductory chapter that
F44 1310  9    metropolitan life had split into two trends- expanding
F44 1320  6    interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing
F44 1330  4    exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends
F44 1340  1    seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.
F44 1340 11    Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves
F44 1350  6    against intrusions. The motifs of impersonal interdependence
F44 1360  6    and insulation of residential communities have polarized;
F44 1370  4    the schism between central city and suburb, Negro and
F44 1380  3    White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as
F44 1390  1    symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in
F44 1390  9    the metropolis. It now becomes evident that the denominational
F44 1400  8    church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class
F44 1410  7    culture, for it serves to crystallize the social class
F44 1420  4    identity of middle-class residential groupings. The
F44 1430  2    accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated
F44 1430  9    the drive to conformity in congregations of the major
F44 1440  9    denominations. This conformity represents a desperate
F44 1450  5    attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment.
F44 1460  2    More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches
F44 1470  2    have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence
F44 1470 10    of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating
F44 1480  5    the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle
F44 1490  7    for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous
F44 1500  3    peoples.
F44 1500  4       Since American life is committed above all to productivity
F44 1510  5    and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing
F44 1520  2    forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have
F44 1530  1    fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding
F44 1530  9    interdependence of the metropolis. Consumer communities
F44 1540  6    have suffered at the hands of the productive interests.
F44 1550  5    Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural newcomers are slowly
F44 1560  4    making their way into the cities. Soon they will fight
F44 1570  2    their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and
F44 1570 11    the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding
F44 1580  8    cycle which has characterized their history for a century.
F44 1590  6    The identification of the basic unit of religious organization-
F44 1600  4    the parish or congregation- with a residential area
F44 1610  3    is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply
F44 1620  1    means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of
F44 1620 12    the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission
F44 1630  7    to co-optation. Mission to the metropolis contradicts
F44 1640  5    survival of the congregation in the residential community,
F44 1650  2    because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan
F44 1660  1    interdependence with residential exclusion.
F44 1660  5       This interpretation of the role of residence in
F44 1670  7    the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various
F44 1680  4    projections for the churches. It could be argued that
F44 1690  2    any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods
F44 1690  9    is doomed to become an expression of the panic for
F44 1700  9    stable identity among the middle classes. It could
F44 1710  5    be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain
F44 1720  1    religious activity, since worship presupposes some
F44 1720  7    local stabilities. Whatever projection one makes, the
F44 1730  6    striking fact about congregational and parochial life
F44 1740  4    is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social
F44 1750  2    identity of middle-class people.
F44 1750  7       Attention will be given in the next chapter to the
F44 1760  7    style of association in the denominational churches;
F44 1770  2    this style is characteristically an expression of the
F44 1780  1    communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes
F44 1780  9    of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements
F44 1790  6    in gaining self-esteem. These values give direction
F44 1800  4    to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating
F44 1810  1    the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern
F44 1810  9    of community participation, setting the style for the
F44 1820  7    psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness, and
F44 1830  5    informing the congregational life of the major denominations.
F44 1840  2    "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly contact"
F44 1850  2    form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its
F44 1850 10    contents are another matter, for they reveal the kinds
F44 1860  9    of interests pursued by the congregation. What goes
F44 1870  6    on in the cage will occupy our attention under the
F44 1880  3    rubric of the organization church. An understanding
F44 1890  1    of the new role of residential association in an industrial
F44 1890 11    society serves to illuminate the forces which have
F44 1900  8    fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons
F44 1910  4    the churches in their suburban captivity.
F44 1920  1       The perplexing question still remains as to why
F44 1920  9    the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle
F44 1930  8    of social identity when their clubs and charities should
F44 1940  4    fill the same need.
