H06 0010  1       Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was
H06 0010  8    the big story in 1960's industrial development effort.
H06 0020  6    Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves
H06 0030  4    to new plant construction, totaling 1,418,000 square
H06 0040  2    feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000;
H06 0040  9    a new post-World War II record. With minor exceptions,
H06 0050 10    this expansion was instituted either by firms based
H06 0060  7    in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already
H06 0080  3    operating here.
H06 0080  5       What made these new location figures particularly
H06 0090  4    impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year
H06 0100  4    of mild business recession throughout the nation, Rhode
H06 0110  1    Island scored marked progress in new industry, new
H06 0110  9    plants, and new jobs.
H06 0120  1       Of the major expansions in 1960, three were financed
H06 0120 10    under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100%
H06 0130  8    guaranteed mortgage plan: Collyer Wire, Leesona Corporation,
H06 0140  7    and American Tube + Controls. Leading firms that arranged
H06 0150  8    their own financing included Speidel Corporation,
H06 0160  4    Cornell-Dubilier,
H06 0160  6    Photek, Inc. Division of Textron, Narragansett Gray
H06 0170  6    Iron Foundry, W. R. Cobb Company, and Mays Manufacturing
H06 0180  6    Company.
H06 0180  7       Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island
H06 0190  8    is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's
H06 0200  5    Industrial Division, and the figures quoted above indicate
H06 0210  4    a successful year's operation. Industrial Division
H06 0220  2    personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode
H06 0220 12    Island concerns during 1960, many of whom are still
H06 0230  9    interested in a Rhode Island location. They are conscious
H06 0240  6    of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance
H06 0250  5    and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants
H06 0260  3    and construction projects in Rhode Island.
H06 0270  1    _AIDS TO SMALL BUSINESS#
H06 0280  1    Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional
H06 0280  1    effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions
H06 0290  1    by major industries, small business is also afforded
H06 0300  1    considerable attention. Our Office of Foreign and Domestic
H06 0310  1    Commerce carries on a vigorous program, directly aimed
H06 0320  1    at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers
H06 0320  2    in the lower employment categories.
H06 0320  7       A primary function is the operation of a Government
H06 0330  7    Bid Center, which receives bids daily from the Federal
H06 0340  6    Government's principal purchasing agencies. Assistance
H06 0350  2    is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen
H06 0360  1    concerning interpretation of bid invitations, where
H06 0360  7    to obtain specifications, and follow-ups concerning
H06 0370  5    qualification. During the past year, 10,517 government
H06 0380  3    bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement
H06 0390  1    leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers.
H06 0390  8       In addition, the Office's domestic trade program
H06 0400  6    provided consultant services to those seeking information
H06 0410  5    on establishment of new businesses; how and where to
H06 0420  5    apply for financial assistance; details on marketing;
H06 0430  1    information concerning patents, copyrights and trade
H06 0430  7    marks, availability of technical reports, and other
H06 0440  6    subjects of interest to small business.
H06 0450  2       The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also
H06 0460  2    active in the field of international trade, assisting
H06 0460 10    Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets
H06 0470  7    abroad. This office cooperates with the U. S. Department
H06 0480  6    of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services
H06 0500  3    which include: statistics on markets abroad; locating
H06 0510  1    foreign agents, buyers, distributors, etc.; information
H06 0510  7    on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations,
H06 0520  8    licensing, investments, and establishing of branch
H06 0530  5    representatives or plants abroad, and documentary requirements
H06 0540  3    concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment.
H06 0550  3       During the year 1960, this office supplied 954 visitors
H06 0560  1    with information related to foreign and domestic commerce,
H06 0560  9    and made 73 field visits.
H06 0570  5    _ADVERTISING PROGRAM_
H06 0570  7       Our media advertising continued, during 1960, its
H06 0580  5    previous effective program that stressed such specifics
H06 0590  3    as 100% financing, plant availabilities, and location
H06 0600  1    advantages. We also continued to run a series of ads
H06 0600 11    featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists
H06 0610  6    who had recently established new plants here.
H06 0620  4       To reach a still greater audience of location-minded
H06 0630  1    manufacturers, our industrial advertising budget for
H06 0630  7    the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000,
H06 0640  8    and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation
H06 0650  5    was upped from $17,000 to $20,000.
H06 0660  3       Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in
H06 0670  1    the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (Eastern
H06 0670 11    and Midwestern editions) which averaged two prominent
H06 0680  6    ads per month, and to a lesser degree the New York
H06 0690  7    Herald Tribune and, for the west coast, the Los Angeles
H06 0700  4    Times and the Wall Street Journal (Pacific Coast edition).
H06 0710  3    In addition to the regular schedule, advertisements
H06 0720  1    were run for maximum impact in special editions of
H06 0720 10    the New York Times, Boston Herald, American Banker,
H06 0730  5    Electronic News and, for local promotion, the Providence
H06 0740  4    Sunday Journal. Magazine advertising included Management
H06 0750  3    Methods, the New Englander, U. S. Investor, and Plant
H06 0760  3    Location.
H06 0760  4       The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra state
H06 0770  5    mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed
H06 0780  1    to electronics, plastics, pharmaceutical, and business
H06 0780  7    machine manufacturers, and to publishers. These totaled
H06 0790  6    6,768 pieces of correspondence.
H06 0800  1       The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of
H06 0800  9    239 inquiries; 164 from media and 75 from direct mail.
H06 0810 10    Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our
H06 0820  8    50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries.
H06 0830  3    New York led in the number of inquiries, followed by
H06 0840  2    California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.
H06 0850  1    Among foreign countries responding were Germany, Canada,
H06 0850  8    Brazil and India.
H06 0860  2    _INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION_
H06 0860  4       An important operation in soliciting industrial
H06 0870  2    locations involves what we term "Missionary calls"
H06 0880  1    by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists.
H06 0880  9    These consist of visits, without previous announcement,
H06 0890  7    on top officials of manufacturing concerns located
H06 0900  4    in highly industrialized areas. More than 25 carefully
H06 0910  4    selected cities were visited, including New York, Brooklyn,
H06 0920  2    Long Island City, Newark, Elizabeth, Stamford, Waterbury,
H06 0930  1    New Haven, Bridgeport, Boston, Cambridge, Worcester,
H06 0930  7    and Waltham.
H06 0940  2       Out of a total of 603 calls, 452 contacts were established
H06 0950  1    with top executive personnel. We received 76 out-of-state
H06 0950 11    visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's
H06 0960  6    industrial advantages, and Industrial Division personnel
H06 0970  5    made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits.
H06 0980  2    _INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCES_
H06 0980  4       During 1960, two important conferences were organized
H06 0990  3    by the Development Council's Industrial Division. In
H06 1000  2    June, the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce-
H06 1010  3    in conjunction with local trade associations, chambers
H06 1010 10    of commerce, and bank officials- sponsored a World
H06 1020  7    Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel. Its
H06 1030  3    purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States'
H06 1040  3    declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959. Approximately
H06 1050  1    100 representatives of business attended this conclave
H06 1050  8    and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted
H06 1060  9    to continue the activity as an annual event.
H06 1070  7       On October 8th of last year, the Industrial Division
H06 1080  4    sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development
H06 1090  4    at the former Henry Barnard School. A comprehensive
H06 1100  2    program devoted to the various phases of the development
H06 1110  1    effort attracted 143 interested individuals.
H06 1110  6       Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller,
H06 1120  6    Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce. Richard Preston,
H06 1130  5    executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning
H06 1140  3    and Development Commission, and Edwin C. Kepler of
H06 1150  3    General Electric Company. Workshop sessions in the
H06 1150 10    afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania,
H06 1160  6    Connecticut and Maine, and rounded out a rewarding
H06 1170  8    program.
H06 1170  9       In connection with this conference, a 64-page supplement
H06 1180  8    was published in the October 2nd edition of the Providence
H06 1190  6    Sunday Journal. Devoted to the improvement in business
H06 1200  4    climate and increase in industrial construction in
H06 1210  2    Rhode Island, it has proved a valuable mailing piece
H06 1210 11    for this Division. More than 2000 copies have been
H06 1220  8    sent out to prospective clients.
H06 1230  1    _MAILINGS AND PUBLICATIONS_
H06 1230  4       Other special mailings by the Industrial Division
H06 1240  3    included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's
H06 1250  1    Conference, letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical
H06 1260  1    Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters
H06 1260  9    and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations
H06 1270  7    as Society of Industrial Realtors. 1184 copies of the
H06 1280  8    R. I. Directory of Manufacturers were distributed:
H06 1290  4    643 in-state and 541 out-of-state.
H06 1300  1       The Industrial Division published, in 1960, a new,
H06 1300  9    attractive industrial brochure, "Rhode Island- Right
H06 1310  6    For Industry", and prepared copy for a new edition
H06 1320  6    of the Directory of Manufacturers (to be printed shortly),
H06 1330  3    and for a new space catalogue.
H06 1330  9       Additional promotional activities included organizing
H06 1340  4    the dedication program for Operation Turnkey, the new
H06 1350  4    automated post office, and a conference with representatives
H06 1360  2    of Brown University, Providence College, and University
H06 1370  1    of Rhode Island, and eight electronics concerns regarding
H06 1380  1    the inauguration of a training program for electronics
H06 1380  9    personnel.
H06 1380 10    #PLANNING DIVISION#
H06 1390  2    Stated in its simplest terms, the main job of the Planning
H06 1400  2    Division is to plan for the future of the State of
H06 1400 13    Rhode Island. The activities of the Planning Division
H06 1410  8    are defined in considerable detail in the enabling
H06 1420  5    act of the Development Council, which assigns to the
H06 1430  4    agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties
H06 1440  1    in the field of planning.
H06 1440  6       Two years ago, the Institute of Public Administration
H06 1450  3    issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled "State-Local
H06 1460  3    Relations in Metropolitan Rhode Island. As the result
H06 1470  3    of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained
H06 1470 11    in this report, plus an analysis of our own enabling
H06 1480 10    act, the Planning Division developed a number of basic
H06 1490  7    planning objectives which caused a reorientation of
H06 1500  4    its work program. These objectives are stated here
H06 1510  1    because of their importance in understanding the current
H06 1510  9    activities of the Planning Division.
H06 1520  5    _(1)_
H06 1520  6       First priority will be given to the preparation
H06 1530  3    of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background
H06 1540  1    for all other planning activities in the state.
H06 1540  9    _(2)_
H06 1540 10       Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute
H06 1550  9    of Public Administration that "Metropolian Planning
H06 1560  4    (in Rhode Island) means, or should mean, state planning",
H06 1570  5    the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan
H06 1580  3    nature of many of Rhode Island's problems.
H06 1590  1    _(3)_
H06 1590  2       It will continue to be an objective of this division
H06 1590 12    to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper
H06 1600  8    and continuing responsibility of local government.
H06 1610  4    To this end, the community assistance program of the
H06 1620  3    planning division will continue to be operated as a
H06 1620 12    staff function to make available, on a shared cost
H06 1630  8    basis, technical planning assistance to those communities
H06 1640  5    in the state unable to maintain their own planning
H06 1650  3    staff.
H06 1650  4    _(4)_
H06 1650  5       The planning division will take the initiative in
H06 1660  2    encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government;
H06 1670  1    among the operating departments of the state; between
H06 1670  9    the cities and towns of the state; and on a regional
H06 1680 10    basis between the six New England states.
H06 1690  3    _(5)_
H06 1690  4       On the basis that all citizens of the state are
H06 1700  2    entitled to benefit equally in the development of its
H06 1700 11    resources, plans for the provision of essential services
H06 1710  8    (such as water) will be based on need regardless of
H06 1720  7    arbitrary political boundaries, within the framework
H06 1730  3    of the state plan.
H06 1730  7    _(6)_
H06 1730  8       The state development budget will reflect the capital
H06 1740  5    needs of all the state agencies and the priority of
H06 1750  2    the projects in the budget will be based on the state
H06 1750 13    plan.
H06 1760  1    _(7)_
H06 1760  2       In preparing the state guide plan, particular attention
H06 1760 10    will be given means of strengthening the economy of
H06 1770  9    the state through the development of industry and recreation.
H06 1780  6       Functionally the planning division carries out four
H06 1790  5    activities: long-range state planning, current state
H06 1800  3    planning, local planning assistance; and the preparation
H06 1810  1    of the state development budget.
H06 1820  1    _LONG RANGE STATE PLANNING_
H06 1820  1       The planning division has embarked on the most complete
H06 1820 10    and comprehensive state planning program in the nation.
H06 1830  7    The long range aspects of this program are divided
H06 1840  5    into four distinct phases: basic mapping, inventory,
H06 1850  2    analysis and plan and policy formation. The work program,
H06 1860  1    as it was originally proposed, was to take five years
H06 1860 11    to complete. Recent events- particularly the necessity
H06 1870  4    of providing planning information for the statewide
H06 1880  4    origin/destination study of the Department of Public
H06 1890  3    Works- indicate that this schedule will have to be
H06 1890 12    accelerated. The basic mapping phase of the program
H06 1900  8    has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled
H06 1910  6    for completion July 1, 1961.
H06 1920  1    _BASIC MAPPING_
H06 1920  2       Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning
H06 1930  1    program, the first step taken by the planning division
H06 1930 10    to implement the long range state plan has been to
H06 1940  8    prepare two series of base maps- one at a scale of
H06 1950  8    1 inch to a mile, and the second a series of 26 sheets
H06 1960  1    at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, covering the entire
H06 1960 13    state. With these maps completed, the inventory phase
H06 1970  7    of the plan has been started.
H06 1980  1    _INVENTORY_
H06 1980  2       With the aid of matching federal funds available
H06 1990  1    under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended,
H06 1990 12    the planning division began a one year program July
H06 2000  8    1, 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state
H06 2010  5    planning program. this phase consists of four items:
H06 2020  2    urban land use, rural land use, physical features and
H06 2020 11    public utility service areas. Since the validity of
H06 2030  8    all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of
H06 2040  6    the basic inventory information, great care is being
H06 2050  3    taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.
H06 2060  1       The urban land use study carried out by the planning
H06 2060 11    division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping
H06 2070  7    all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide
H06 2080  5    planning. The rural land use study is being carried
H06 2090  3    out under contract by the University of Rhode Island
H06 2100  1    and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state
H06 2100 10    by type of use. The mapping of important physical features
H06 2110  7    such as slopes and types of soil and the collection
H06 2120  6    of all available information pertaining to public utility
H06 2130  3    service areas are being conducted as staff projects
H06 2130 11    and, like the other two inventory projects, are scheduled
H06 2140  9    for completion July 1, 1961.
H06 2150  4    _ANALYSIS_
H06 2150  5       The collection of information is meaningless unless
H06 2160  2    it is understood and used for a definite purpose.
