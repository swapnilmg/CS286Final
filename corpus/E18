E18 0010  1       The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in
E18 0010 10    Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects.
E18 0020  8    For their length, their types of construction, their
E18 0030  5    picturesque settings, and their literary associations,
E18 0040  2    they should be known and remembered. In this sequence
E18 0050  1    I shall write about them in the order of their erection.
E18 0050 12       The first bridge known to have been covered wholly
E18 0060  9    or in part,- and perhaps the most interesting one,
E18 0070  5    connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with Salisbury
E18 0080  2    Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when
E18 0080 11    a group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned
E18 0090  8    the General Court for an act of incorporation. This
E18 0100  7    document began:
E18 0110  1    _"NO. 1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_
E18 0110  7          "Whereas, a Bridge over Merrimack River, from
E18 0120  4    the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf, Esquire, in
E18 0130  3    Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury,
E18 0140  1    would be of very extensive utility, by affording a
E18 0140 10    safe Conveyance to Carriages, Teams and Travellers
E18 0150  3    at all seasons of the year, and at all Times of Tide.
E18 0160  7       "We, the Subscribers, do agree, that as soon as
E18 0170  5    a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this,
E18 0180  2    or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to
E18 0180 12    the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
E18 0190  8    praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic
E18 0200  9    the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build
E18 0210  6    such a Bridge, and a Right to demand a Toll equal to
E18 0220  5    that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms,
E18 0230  1    and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally
E18 0230 12    agree each with the others, that we will hold in the
E18 0240 10    said Bridge the several shares set against our respective
E18 0250  5    Names, the whole into two hundred shares being divided,
E18 0260  3    and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times
E18 0270  1    and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation,
E18 0270 11    shall be directed and required".
E18 0280  5       This paper was signed by forty-five persons, subscribing
E18 0290  3    a total of two hundred shares.
E18 0290  9       A month later the General Court served notice to
E18 0300  8    the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built.
E18 0310  7    The matter was considered and reconsidered, and finally
E18 0320  3    opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court
E18 0330  1    granted a charter on January 9, 1792. On November 26
E18 0330 11    of that year the bridge was completed and opened.
E18 0340  6       Timothy Palmer, who invented and later patented
E18 0350  4    the arch type of construction for wooden bridges, was
E18 0360  2    the genius who planned and supervised the building
E18 0360 10    of the Essex, or "Deer Island" bridge although the
E18 0370  7    actual work was carried out under the direction of
E18 0380  6    William Coombs, who received @ 300 as recompense.
E18 0390  1       This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy
E18 0400  1    Dwight, president of Yale College, in his "Travels
E18 0400  9    in New-England and New-York", published in New Haven
E18 0410  8    in 1821. He says of it:
E18 0420  3       "It consists of two divisions, separated by an island
E18 0430  1    at a small distance from the southern shore. The division
E18 0430 11    between the island and this shore, consists principally
E18 0440  8    of an arch; whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet,
E18 0450  8    and whose vortex is forty feet (it was actually 37
E18 0460  4    feet) above the high-water mark. In appearance and
E18 0470  1    construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge. The
E18 0470  8    whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty
E18 0480  8    feet and its breadth thirty-four. I have already mentioned
E18 0490  5    that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor
E18 0500  4    of the arched bridges in this country. As Mr. Palmer
E18 0510  2    was educated to house-building only, and had never
E18 0510 11    seen a structure of this nature; he certainly deserves
E18 0520  8    not a little credit for the invention".
E18 0530  4       It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered
E18 0540  3    bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby
E18 0550  1    Rowley; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford
E18 0550 11    when he was sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed
E18 0560  8    to a builder and architect, Moody Spofford. It was
E18 0570  5    indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no
E18 0580  5    experience of bridge building should have applied the
E18 0590  1    principle of the arch, which appears in his famous
E18 0590 10    bridges at Portsmouth, Haverhill, and Philadelphia.
E18 0600  4       The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was
E18 0610  5    not covered. As far as we know, no American bridge
E18 0620  2    had been thus protected in 1792. Richard S. Allen is
E18 0620 12    the authority for the statement that the northern section
E18 0630  9    was probably roofed by 1810. Its original appearance
E18 0640  6    is shown in an engraving published in the "Massachusetts
E18 0650  4    Magazine" in May 1793, which is reproduced herewith
E18 0660  2    (Fig. 1). A brief description accompanying the picture
E18 0670  1    says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons
E18 0670 10    of timber. Between the abutments on the Newbury shore
E18 0680  7    and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span
E18 0690  5    or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north shore
E18 0700  2    of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an
E18 0700 12    arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw
E18 0710 11    forty feet long.
E18 0710 14       A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece
E18 0720  9    of engineering took place July 4, 1793, in a tavern
E18 0730  7    erected by the corporation on the island. It is said
E18 0740  4    that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the
E18 0750  1    first share-holders, stood on the table and made a
E18 0750 11    speech worthy of the occasion. The "Essex Journal"
E18 0760  5    says that he "delivered an oration on the bridge, which
E18 0770  5    for elegance of style, propriety of speech or force
E18 0780  3    of argument, was truly Ciceronian". The reporter must
E18 0780 11    have written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's
E18 0790  9    oration could hardly be understood; and, although he
E18 0800  7    later explained that he was talking French, it seems
E18 0810  5    rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys
E18 0820  3    of the evening.
E18 0820  6       The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth
E18 0830  4    the cost of construction, although it proved to be
E18 0830 13    twice what was estimated in the beginning. It stood
E18 0840  9    in its original form until 1882. The southern half,
E18 0850  6    however, on account of its underbracing, was considered
E18 0860  3    by boat owners a menace to navigation. In 1810 it was
E18 0870  2    torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.
E18 0870 11    This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted
E18 0880  7    by James Finley of Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Timothy
E18 0890  4    Palmer had general supervision of the work.
E18 0900  4       An advertisement in the "Newburyport Herald", December
E18 0910  2    21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert
E18 0910 13    on chain bridges. It reads:
E18 0920  4    _"CHAIN BRIDGES_
E18 0920  6          "Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy
E18 0930  7    Palmer of Newburyport, Mass. has agreed to take charge
E18 0940  6    of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge,
E18 0950  3    in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,
E18 0960  1    Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to
E18 0960 10    the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain
E18 0970  9    Bridges.
E18 0970 10       "Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating
E18 0980  8    to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site,
E18 0990  7    and lay out and superintend the work, or recommend
E18 1000  4    a suitable person to execute it.
E18 1000 10       John Templeman
E18 1020  1       "Approved, Timothy Palmer"
E18 1020  4       This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden
E18 1030  6    arch on the Salisbury end. It fell, February 6, 1827,
E18 1040  4    carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four
E18 1050  1    oxen. The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned.
E18 1050 12    In spite of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt
E18 1060  8    on the same plan and opened again on July 17, 1827.
E18 1070  6    This second chain bridge was 570 feet long, had two
E18 1080  3    thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.
E18 1090  1       The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868,
E18 1090 10    when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack
E18 1100  7    bridges as highways.
E18 1110  1       Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous
E18 1120  1    use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the
E18 1120 10    Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive
E18 1130  7    part in the week-long observance of the first land
E18 1140  5    battle of the Civil War at its home site, May 28th
E18 1150  2    to June 3rd. Colonel Frederick W. Lander, impersonated,
E18 1160  1    will again make his break-neck ride down the steep
E18 1160 11    declivity of Talbott's (now College) Hill and thunder
E18 1170  6    across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's
E18 1180  4    (West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming through the
E18 1190  3    streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.
E18 1200  1    He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops-
E18 1200 11    thus the old bridge has another distinction; that of
E18 1210  8    being the first such structure secured by force of
E18 1220  5    arms in the war of the '60s.
E18 1220 12       The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the
E18 1230  9    elements, war, fire, and floods, as well as injuries
E18 1240  7    incident to heavy traffic, for more than a hundred
E18 1250  3    years. Twice during the Civil War it was saved from
E18 1250 13    destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and
E18 1260  9    prayers of a local minister. It still stands as a monument
E18 1270  7    to the engineering skills of the last century and still
E18 1280  5    serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on
E18 1290  2    U.S. Route 250- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.
E18 1300  1    It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving
E18 1300 13    bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S.
E18 1310 11    highway system, thus it is far more than a relic of
E18 1320  9    the horse and buggy days.
E18 1320 14       This covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified
E18 1330  8    with the first action in the early morning of June
E18 1340  7    3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements of both
E18 1350  3    armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part
E18 1360  1    and parcel of the war story. So frequently has pictures
E18 1360 11    of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications
E18 1370  8    that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers
E18 1380  7    Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in
E18 1390  3    West Virginia.
E18 1390  5       Completed and opened for traffic in 1852, the bridge
E18 1400  5    was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his
E18 1410  3    brother, Eli, of Beverly. The Chenoweth brothers were
E18 1410 11    experienced bridge builders, and against the competition
E18 1420  7    of other, and better known, bridge designers and builders
E18 1430  6    they had constructed nine of the covered, wooden bridges
E18 1440  5    on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years
E18 1450  4    before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.
E18 1460  1    The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master
E18 1460  9    piece, with its 139-foot, dual lane, span- and it stands
E18 1470 11    today as a monument to its builders. Never rebuilt,
E18 1480  6    the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers,
E18 1490  5    a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper side
E18 1500  2    in order to care for modern traffic.
E18 1500  9       During the war it was in constant use by the wagon
E18 1510  8    trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton
E18 1520  4    to the troops operating in the interior. Union soldiers
E18 1530  2    at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from
E18 1530 12    the rain or other inclement weather, and some of them
E18 1540 10    left momentoes of their stay by carving their names
E18 1550  6    and small tokens on its walls and beams.
E18 1560  1       But what the elements could not do was seriously
E18 1560 10    threatened when Brigadier General William E. (Grumble)
E18 1570  7    Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden
E18 1580  7    raid in May, 1863. General Jones was fresh from a long
E18 1590  7    series of bridge burnings, including the long bridge
E18 1600  3    at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses
E18 1610  1    and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge,
E18 1610 10    he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and
E18 1620  7    around it. Reverend Joshual Corder, a Baptist minister,
E18 1630  4    gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies, to
E18 1640  2    call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure;
E18 1640 13    he reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or
E18 1650  9    other Confederate commanders would need it should troops
E18 1660  7    pass that way in retreat. Jones relented, he did not
E18 1670  5    order his men to apply the torch- the drove of livestock
E18 1680  2    was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the
E18 1680 12    mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army, while
E18 1690  9    Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join
E18 1700  6    forces with Imboden.
E18 1710  1       Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union
E18 1710  9    soldiers planned to destroy it, after filling its two
E18 1720  8    lanes with hay and straw- but for what reason is not
E18 1730  6    recorded nor remembered, certainly not because of pressure
E18 1740  3    from an opposing Confederate force. On the second occasion
E18 1750  1    it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers
E18 1750 12    from their purpose.
E18 1760  2       Centering around this historic old structure, a
E18 1760  9    group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have
E18 1770  8    organized and planned a week-long series of events,
E18 1780  7    beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd,
E18 1790  4    to observe most appropriately the centennial of the
E18 1800  2    first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.
