N22 0010  1       "I guess he spent the morning getting himself all
N22 0010 10    organized, then headed for home. Maybe to beat up on
N22 0020 10    his squaw". Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head
N22 0030  7    tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the
N22 0040  5    overall bib. Ramey reached out with the tire iron and
N22 0050  2    dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare
N22 0050 13    tire rack.
N22 0060  1       "I'd like to know just which it is that those guys
N22 0060 12    don't understand, the liquor or automobiles". Somehow
N22 0070  7    the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no
N22 0080  6    one had ever really helped him understand moved the
N22 0090  3    driver. For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless
N22 0100  1    drivers softened. Maybe the Indian wasn't too much
N22 0100  9    at fault, Ramey thought. Maybe he was only doing the
N22 0110  9    best he knew how, like any of us. Anyway, he doesn't
N22 0120  6    deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at.
N22 0130  3       "Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement, Benny"?
N22 0140  1    he said to his partner.
N22 0140  6       "You mean dream"?
N22 0150  1       "Not exactly. Just see it". Benson grinned and flipped
N22 0150 10    a rock with his thumb like a marble.
N22 0160  7       "Nope, just you, all the time- sometimes I think
N22 0170  6    it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner".
N22 0180  2       Ramey smiled but he thought to himself, I always
N22 0190  1    see me too. Never Benny. Whenever he saw someone lying
N22 0190 11    in the dirt, Ramey wondered what the person had been
N22 0200  8    thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind.
N22 0210  6    Then he would realize they were really things that
N22 0220  2    only he himself could think. With this realization,
N22 0220 10    sometimes, he saw himself as he looked down.
N22 0230  8       "You seen him yet"? Benson said, referring to the
N22 0240  6    Indian.
N22 0240  7       "He wasn't in the car", Ramey said.
N22 0250  4       "You didn't go clear around", Benson said. "If you
N22 0260  4    want to see something, he's back on the other side
N22 0270  2    by the trunk of the car".
N22 0270  8       "Too long a waiting line", Ramey answered, pretending
N22 0280  4    to joke.
N22 0280  6       A few minutes later the insurance man, a road checker,
N22 0290  6    drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it
N22 0300  4    from a far-away state. It was a trick they used to
N22 0300 16    try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks
N22 0310  9    to check their speed. Sometimes they just parked at
N22 0330  6    the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as
N22 0340  5    they passed. All the drivers knew about the plates
N22 0350  1    and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with
N22 0350 12    shredded edges, the kind natives in travel ads wear
N22 0360  8    when they are out joyfully chopping cane. Horsely,
N22 0370  3    an agent on the east end, wore the hat, trying to look
N22 0380  2    like a tourist. It had always seemed strange to Ramey
N22 0380 12    that to disguise himself as a tourist, an ex-truck
N22 0390  9    driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish
N22 0400  5    and put it on his head.
N22 0400 11       The insurance man informed them that he had talked
N22 0410  8    to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch
N22 0420  7    the men's personal effects until they towed the rig
N22 0430  4    back to town. He chatted with Ramey and Benson for
N22 0430 14    a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer.
N22 0440 11    Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came
N22 0450  7    under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then
N22 0460  4    speeded up again as it got clear.
N22 0460 11       When they were ready to leave, Benson and Ramey
N22 0470  8    walked back around the rear of the trailer.
N22 0480  3       "There's a body you won't mind looking at", Benson
N22 0490  2    said and they stopped. She had driven up with her husband
N22 0500  1    in a convertible with Eastern license plates, although
N22 0500  9    the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that.
N22 0510  8    She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt. Slender
N22 0520  5    and tanned, her dark brown hair was drawn straight
N22 0530  2    back, simply.
N22 0530  4       "What outfit does she drive for"? Benson said.
N22 0540  3       Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey, a recognition.
N22 0550  1    She might have been someone he had once loved. He had
N22 0550 12    never seen her before, but now he thought of the manner
N22 0560 10    in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities,
N22 0570  8    at each end of their run. The truck routes, the industrial
N22 0580  4    areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly
N22 0590  2    through his mind- back alleys were their access to
N22 0590 11    a city and they could never stay. How would you ever
N22 0600 10    see her again? The feeling subsided, it was only a
N22 0610  6    small yearning. Their work was lonely.
N22 0620  1       "What's she doing in this bunch"? Benson said, and
N22 0620 10    Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have
N22 0630  8    been.
N22 0630  9       The girl looked around at the countryside. Her glance
N22 0640  8    swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing.
N22 0650  7    It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire
N22 0660  5    over a piece of gravel then moved on. She began to
N22 0670  2    watch a blonde-haired man, also in shorts, standing
N22 0670 11    right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot
N22 0680  9    that most of the crowd had detoured slightly. What
N22 0690  3    had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself,
N22 0700  2    so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could
N22 0700 12    see, but Benson knew what it was. The girl took a couple
N22 0710 11    of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson, in that
N22 0720  8    barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real,
N22 0730  5    said, "You don't want to go around there, Ma'am". The
N22 0740  3    girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge
N22 0750  1    that someone had spoken to her.
N22 0750  7       The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the
N22 0760  6    Indian who lay face down almost under the car. The
N22 0770  2    two drivers moved closer.
N22 0770  6       "What does he want, a spoon"? Benson said to Ramey.
N22 0780  5       One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory
N22 0790  4    and stick like meat in a crooked tooth, while the rest
N22 0800  1    of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain. With
N22 0800 10    Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the
N22 0810 10    Indian's foot that he would always remember. The laces
N22 0820  5    were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there
N22 0830  3    was still a bow knot at the top. The slightest twitch
N22 0830 14    would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot,
N22 0840  9    yet the toes were still inside.
N22 0850  2       The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed
N22 0860  1    man. He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with
N22 0860 11    a red V at the neck, the sleeves pushed above the
N22 0870  9    elbows. He turned and looked at them with clear blue
N22 0880  6    eyes, immaculate eyes. He was very tanned- big hands
N22 0890  5    might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster.
N22 0900  1       "He's dead, isn't he"? the man said. He turned and
N22 0900 10    bent over the body of the Indian. There was nothing
N22 0910  9    in particular on the man's face. It was simply a matter
N22 0920  7    of curiosity, a natural right to examine.
N22 0930  1       "What's this"? the man said, backing up a step,
N22 0940  1    still looking down. His words were mostly to himself.
N22 0940 10       "Don't". There was a gentle concern in Benson's
N22 0950  8    voice. Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker
N22 0960  7    at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge
N22 0970  4    a bit of folded, blood-flecked substance lying by itself
N22 0980  2    on the pavement.
N22 0980  5       "But what is it"? the man said with a tone of impatience.
N22 0990  6       But what is it? The man had spoken only once. Ramey
N22 1000  5    heard the words again inside, weakened, the way moving
N22 1010  3    water sounds through a grove of trees, until he was
N22 1010 13    not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing
N22 1020  9    in his ears.
N22 1030  1       The sneaker reached out once more to tap against
N22 1030 10    the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an
N22 1040  6    unreasonable clarity of the man's leg. Ramey saw sunlight
N22 1050  5    touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin. He
N22 1060  3    stared at the shining, shining circles of hairs and
N22 1060 12    heard the voice of his partner through trees, "Don't
N22 1070  8    do that, fella. Them's brains".
N22 1080  2       The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought
N22 1090  1    the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that
N22 1090 12    the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again,
N22 1100 10    with his fist. Ramey swung and caught the man just
N22 1110  6    to the left of his mouth. It was a straight, solid,
N22 1120  2    once-in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles
N22 1120 12    in between the man's cheekbone and his chin. Ramey's
N22 1130  8    fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing
N22 1140  5    cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands
N22 1150  3    clapping together.
N22 1150  5       The man took two short steps backward then sat down
N22 1160  5    heavily on the pavement. Ramey heard a cry from the
N22 1170  2    girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand.
N22 1170 12    As he watched the man sit suddenly, a detached part
N22 1180  8    of his mind observed how very difficult it was, really,
N22 1190  5    to knock a man off his feet. He hadn't done it this
N22 1200  4    time and he would never again hit anyone so hard.
N22 1210  1       With a thoughtful look, the man sat on the pavement,
N22 1210 11    legs straight out in front of him. His arms hung like
N22 1220  9    empty shirt sleeves, and his mouth was slightly open.
N22 1230  4    After what seemed several seconds, the open mouth grew
N22 1240  2    dark inside then blood began to ooze from it. The man
N22 1240 13    brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled
N22 1250  9    across his face until he touched his mouth. He moaned
N22 1260  6    and pulled the hand away. Even yet there was no realization
N22 1270  4    in his eyes.
N22 1270  7       Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind
N22 1280  5    him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder
N22 1290  2    had no identity or importance to him. He did not look
N22 1290 13    around.
N22 1300  1       "What happened"? someone said.
N22 1300  5       "He's hurt"! A woman's voice said, and then he heard
N22 1310  9    a sort of wail from the man's wife. The man on the
N22 1320  8    ground began to move; one of his hands flattened out
N22 1330  4    on the pavement and supported him. Blood dripped down
N22 1340  2    the front of his sweater, soaking into a dark streak
N22 1340 12    of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on
N22 1350  8    his shoulder, as though the bright V woven into the
N22 1360  6    neckline had melted, running a darker color.
N22 1370  1       The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at
N22 1370 11    his back. "Can you hear, can you talk to me"? she begged.
N22 1380 11    An incoherent, puzzled sound came from the red mouth.
N22 1390  8    The girl looked around quickly at several of the people.
N22 1400  6    None of the crowd had stepped forward to help. Then
N22 1410  3    she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment.
N22 1420  1       "Why did you do it- why did you hit him"? she said,
N22 1430  1    her voice rising. Ramey said nothing. A shine in her
N22 1430 11    eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her
N22 1440  9    husband again.
N22 1440 11       Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning
N22 1450  7    whispers. No one seemed to know for sure what had happened,
N22 1460  8    nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the
N22 1470  3    muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver,
N22 1480  1    beyond finding out.
N22 1480  4       Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner
N22 1490  2    near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to
N22 1490 12    the patrolman. Benson moved his arms, gesturing with
N22 1500  7    an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly. Ramey caught
N22 1510  5    a glimpse of the insurance man. Some of the ruddiness
N22 1520  3    was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey. It's
N22 1530  1    all over now, the driver thought as he saw the patrolman
N22 1530 12    turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward
N22 1540  7    them. Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean
N22 1550  6    as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer. He
N22 1560  2    saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under
N22 1560 14    the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster
N22 1570  8    that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky
N22 1580  8    body, the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip
N22 1590  4    of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of
N22 1600  1    his pistol.
N22 1600  3       "All right, step back"! the patrolman said to no
N22 1610  3    one in particular as he pushed between the fat man
N22 1610 13    in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis. He walked
N22 1620 10    straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent
N22 1630  6    over to look at him.
N22 1630 11       "You all right"?
N22 1640  1       "Mough- it's my mough", the man said, trying to
N22 1650  2    talk without moving his lips. His brown face looked
N22 1650 11    gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off
N22 1660  8    the dusty pavement and rubbed across it.
