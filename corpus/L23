L23 0010  1       That's what the man had said. Haney peered doubtfully
L23 0010 10    at his drinking companion through bleary, tear-filled
L23 0020  7    eyes. He had no ready answer, as much from surprise
L23 0030  6    as from the fit of coughing. Was the man drunk or crazy
L23 0040  5    or both? But his new-found buddy had matched him drink
L23 0050  2    for drink until he lost count, and the man's eyes were
L23 0050 13    still clear.
L23 0060  2       The guy is off his rocker, Haney thought to himself,
L23 0070  1    and looked away from those eyes. Eyes that were clear,
L23 0070 11    but also bright with a strange intensity, a sort of
L23 0080  8    cold fire burning behind them. Why hadn't he noticed
L23 0090  5    it before? No, the man was not drunk ...
L23 0100  1       He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger.
L23 0100 11    But, of course, he remembered now. It was blurred,
L23 0110  7    after two hours of steady drinking, but the occasion
L23 0120  4    of it came back to him. The stranger, his head seemingly
L23 0130  2    sunk in thought, started to cross the street against
L23 0130 11    the light just as a huge moving van roared through
L23 0140 10    the intersection.
L23 0150  1       Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously, but the
L23 0150 10    man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to
L23 0160  9    him a second before. His shout had been involuntary,
L23 0170  4    something anybody might have done without thinking,
L23 0180  1    on the spur of the moment. As a matter of fact, he
L23 0180 13    wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit.
L23 0190 11    Actually, he regretted having opened his mouth when
L23 0200  5    the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped
L23 0210  2    down from the cab and walked back toward them.
L23 0210 11       By then, the stranger was thanking Haney profusely
L23 0220  7    and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were
L23 0230  6    an old friend. So the driver started to curse at both
L23 0240  3    of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin
L23 0240 16    his safe-driving record.
L23 0250  4       Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely
L23 0260  2    into the truck driver's face, without saying a word.
L23 0260 11    Very suddenly, the driver stopped swearing at them,
L23 0270  8    turned on his heel and went back to his truck.
L23 0280  6       Haney hadn't given it much thought at the time.
L23 0290  3    Now he recalled it very clearly, and wondered what
L23 0290 12    the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him
L23 0300 10    back off. It must have been the sort of look that can
L23 0310  8    call a bluff without saying a word.
L23 0320  1       When the light went their way, they went on across
L23 0320 11    the street. And when the stranger found out that Phil
L23 0330  8    was on the way to one of his favorite bars, he insisted
L23 0340  5    on offering to buy drinks for both of them.
L23 0350  1       Phil usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting
L23 0350 10    in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite
L23 0360  9    grudges. But he decided he wouldn't mind company in
L23 0370  6    return for free drinks, even though he made good money
L23 0380  5    at his job. Phil was like that.
L23 0380 12    ##
L23 0380 13    NOW he wondered if it was worth it, having a screwball
L23 0400  9    for company. He really didn't take the offer seriously,
L23 0410  6    but he began to feel uneasy. When he finally got the
L23 0420  5    coughing under control, he realized that Pete (all
L23 0430  1    he gave was his first name) was still waiting for an
L23 0430 12    answer- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued
L23 0440  8    to stare.
L23 0440 10       Haney managed a weak laugh. "Guess I can't think
L23 0450  8    of anyone, Pete. Thanks anyhow".
L23 0460  1       A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows.
L23 0470  1    "I think you aren't taking me seriously, Phil. I meant
L23 0470 11    it. And everybody has some kind of grudge. I might
L23 0480  9    have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you. I
L23 0490  7    believe in returning favors. I'll do anything for somebody
L23 0500  4    I like. It won't cost you a cent, Phil. Go ahead and
L23 0510  3    try me"!
L23 0510  5       Phil rubbed his forehead wearily. He was beginning
L23 0520  3    to feel woolly. Maybe it would be better to humor the
L23 0530  1    guy and then make an exit. He really didn't expect
L23 0530 11    anything to come of it, and there were a few people
L23 0540  9    ...
L23 0540 10       "All right", he conceded finally, "if you must know,
L23 0550  7    I don't get along with the landlord. He keeps riding
L23 0560  5    me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while
L23 0570  4    I'm taking a bath. He says the neighbors complain,
L23 0580  1    but I don't believe it. Why don't they tell me themselves
L23 0580 12    if it bothers them"?
L23 0590  3       The man closed his eyes and nodded. When he looked
L23 0600  2    up again, he seeemd almost contented. "Fine. Give me
L23 0600 11    your address. It will take a little time. I want to
L23 0610 11    study your landlord's habits and movements first. You
L23 0620  6    see, I always make it look like an accident. Maybe
L23 0630  4    suicide, if it looks reasonable. In that way there's
L23 0640  1    no trouble for the customer".
L23 0640  6       Haney's eyebrows flew up. "Customer"?
L23 0650  3       Pete smiled modestly. "It's my line of work", he
L23 0660  5    said ...
L23 0660  7       Five minutes later, before Haney could make his
L23 0670  4    break, the stranger stood up and nodded farewell. Haney
L23 0680  1    watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly
L23 0680 12    and silently, and felt relieved to see that nobody
L23 0690  8    else seemed to notice his departure.
L23 0700  1       Phil decided to stay a little longer, and as time
L23 0700 11    passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never
L23 0710 11    been there, but for the other glass on the table. Some
L23 0720  8    time before midnight he returned to his apartment and
L23 0730  5    hit the sack, putting the whole incident out of mind
L23 0740  2    before he fell asleep.
L23 0740  6       The next day, Sunday, the hangover reminded Haney
L23 0750  3    where he had been the night before. The hangover in
L23 0760  2    turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy,
L23 0760 11    and he groaned. He went for more aspirin later in the
L23 0770 10    day, and passed the surly landlord on the way- he was
L23 0780  7    still alive and scowling as usual, as if tenants were
L23 0790  5    a burden in his life. Phil shrugged and ignored him.
L23 0800  1       He went back to work Monday. By Wednesday the landlord
L23 0800 11    was still alive. Of course ... On Thursday, Haney mailed
L23 0810 10    the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife
L23 0820  8    Lolly, and wished the stranger could do something about
L23 0830  5    her ...
L23 0830  7       Coming home from work, he was startled to see a
L23 0840  7    police car parked in front of the apartment building.
L23 0850  2    Inside the lobby, people were standing around, talking
L23 0850 10    excitedly. His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition
L23 0860  8    as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened.
L23 0870  8       The landlord had died. Late that afternoon, it seemed,
L23 0880  6    he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand
L23 0890  5    or inspection. He had apparently been alone. Nobody
L23 0900  1    witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when
L23 0900  9    his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement
L23 0910  8    delivery entrance.
L23 0920  1       Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor,
L23 0920  9    as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks. He muttered
L23 0930  8    something about how terrible it was, and walked with
L23 0940  6    deliberate slowness to the elevator. Once inside his
L23 0950  3    apartment, he poured a drink with trembling hands and
L23 0950 12    flopped limply in a chair.
L23 0960  5       After a while he began to feel better about it,
L23 0970  2    especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.
L23 0970 11    But after all, why should they? Still later, he finally
L23 0980  9    convinced himself that it was an accident- just a coincidence.
L23 0990  9    The stranger really had nothing to do with it, of course
L23 1000  9    ...
L23 1000 10       Haney went to bed, happy that at least he was rid
L23 1010  8    of that lousy landlord. After all, the man had no family,
L23 1020  5    so no one suffered, and everybody was better off for
L23 1030  2    it. Really, he said to himself, nobody kills a man
L23 1030 12    just as a favor!
L23 1040  1       So you thought I didn't mean what I said. The stranger's
L23 1050  1    eyes were large and sad, as if Phil Haney had hurt
L23 1050 12    his feelings. It was like a recurrent, annoying dream,
L23 1060  8    but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones
L23 1070  6    of a nightmare.
L23 1070  9       However, Haney knew it was not a dream. He might
L23 1080  9    be very tight, but he knew where he was. It was the
L23 1090  6    same bar, and it was two weeks later- Saturday night,
L23 1100  2    when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual.
L23 1100 12    ##
L23 1100 13    HE had been sitting in the usual corner at the little
L23 1120 11    table, as far as possible from any talkative, friendly
L23 1130  5    lushes. He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing
L23 1140  4    down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened
L23 1150  1    with water. This favorite grievance was not the landlord.
L23 1150 10    He had already quite forgotten about him. In fact,
L23 1160  8    he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment.
L23 1170  7    His real grievance was Lolly.
L23 1180  1       Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball, while
L23 1180  9    he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with
L23 1190  8    the bottom of the glass, he became aware that he was
L23 1200  5    not alone. He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld
L23 1210  1    the stranger sitting across the table, smiling a secret
L23 1210 10    smile at him, as if they were fellow conspirators.
L23 1220  7    He hadn't even noticed- what was his name? Pete?- he
L23 1230  7    hadn't seen him sit down. The man was uncanny, like
L23 1240  4    a shadow, and made as much noise as a shadow.
L23 1250  1       Haney felt like shrinking out of sight, but he was
L23 1250 11    already trapped in the corner with the wiry, dark little
L23 1260  9    man. He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other
L23 1270  6    evening when the truck bore down through the crossing.
L23 1280  3    Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep
L23 1290  1    for a bar-buddy? He'd have to start going to some of
L23 1290 13    the other places again.
L23 1300  2       In a low voice, almost whispering, the man had asked
L23 1310  1    Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had
L23 1310 12    been taken off his back. He made the mistake of answering
L23 1320  9    in an offhand way, and instantly realized that his
L23 1330  4    skepticism must have showed in his face or voice.
L23 1340  1       Pete frowned slightly, then became sad and moody.
L23 1340  9    Haney didn't want to encourage his company, but felt
L23 1350  9    he ought to buy him a drink anyhow, to prevent possible
L23 1360  6    trouble. But there was no trouble. The guy sulked over
L23 1370  5    his drink, obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation.
L23 1380  2       To break the uncomfortable silence, Haney began
L23 1390  1    to talk. In time, and two drinks later, he was complaining
L23 1390 12    bitterly about his wife, He was on the subject for
L23 1400 10    ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest
L23 1410  5    in his listener- it showed in the alert face and the
L23 1420  4    suddenly bright eyes.
L23 1420  7       When he paused to moisten his throat, the stranger
L23 1430  5    broke in. "But why pay her bills? If she runs around
L23 1440  3    with other men, and if you hate her as you say, why
L23 1440 15    not just divorce her"?
L23 1450  4       Haney scowled. "That bitch would love a divorce",
L23 1460  3    he growled. "Then she'd get half of everything I have.
L23 1470  2    Community property deal- you know. I'd have to sell
L23 1470 11    out my business to pay her off with her share. She
L23 1480 11    can drop dead"!
L23 1490  1       Pete nodded understandingly. "Oh yes. Now I see.
L23 1490  9    You must understand, I haven't been in this state too
L23 1500  9    long. I came out here to retire. That's why I- why
L23 1510  7    I do a free job now and then. You should have told
L23 1520  4    me about her before".
L23 1520  8       Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the
L23 1530  7    now familiar line again. Then a wild thought ran circles
L23 1540  4    through his clouded brain. Suppose- just suppose this
L23 1550  2    guy was really what he said he was! A retired professional
L23 1550 13    killer ... If he was just a nut, no harm was done.
L23 1560 12    But if he was the real thing, he could do something
L23 1570  7    about Lolly. He felt very cunning, very proud of himself
L23 1580  5    as he played on the other man's soft spot.
L23 1590  1       "No offense intended", he said gently. "But it's
L23 1590  9    just that- well, you know. The cops didn't suspect
L23 1600 10    a thing, and I thought it was a coincidence. After
L23 1610  6    all, I didn't know you, Pete. It could have been an
L23 1620  5    accident". He shrugged casually. "But if you say you
L23 1630  4    managed it ..." The stranger was hooked. His eyes burned
L23 1640  1    feverishly. "Yes, yes", he muttered impatiently. "Of
L23 1640  8    course it looked like an accident. I always work it
L23 1650 10    that way- and always at a time when the customer has
L23 1660  8    an alibi. Let me prove it, Phil. I think I can manage
L23 1670  5    one more favor for you". He waited eagerly.
L23 1680  1       Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass.
