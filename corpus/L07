L07 0010  1       He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room.
L07 0010 12    The maid answered and he decided Nancy must be at work.
L07 0020 10       Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then,
L07 0030  9    ignoring his own advice, said excitedly, "But it does
L07 0040  4    sound good. A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything
L07 0050  2    about herself. That courtyard picture with the same
L07 0050 10    initials".
L07 0060  1       "I'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm.
L07 0070  1    I'll call you in a day or so".
L07 0070  9       On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive
L07 0080  5    over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast.
L07 0090  1       Gulf Springs was ten miles inland- more of a quaint
L07 0090 11    old coast town than those along the beach made garish
L07 0100 10    by tourist attractions.
L07 0110  1       He checked into a motel and drove downtown. The
L07 0110 10    courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary
L07 0120  9    dome. Instead of the usual straggling privet hedges
L07 0130  5    and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares,
L07 0140  2    the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth
L07 0140 11    of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably
L07 0150 10    bright-green shade of florist's grass.
L07 0160  5       He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff.
L07 0170  4    A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff
L07 0180  1    Carruthers, a big, paunchy man with thick, white hair
L07 0180 10    and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested
L07 0190  6    he should be running for higher office.
L07 0200  2       Seated in front of the desk, Hank said, "I'm looking
L07 0210  2    for some information with very little to go on, Sheriff".
L07 0210 12       He explained the background of the case, ending
L07 0220  9    with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf
L07 0230  8    Springs.
L07 0230  9       The sheriff's swivel chair tilted back. "So you're
L07 0240  7    looking for a woman who married a man who might have
L07 0250  6    lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned.
L07 0260  1    If there was such a person, I'm afraid she got away
L07 0260 12    with it. Pity we don't know more about him. I think
L07 0270 11    the best bet is to go through the society columns of
L07 0280  7    last year and see if any of the grooms match with the
L07 0290  4    obituaries a little later. It'll be a tedious job,
L07 0300  1    but if you want to try it, the old newspaper files
L07 0300 12    are in the basement here in the county supervisor's
L07 0310  6    office".
L07 0310  7       "Maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking
L07 0320  7    out-of-town bride".
L07 0330  1       "That's an idea. Mrs. Calhoun has been society editor
L07 0330 10    here for twenty-five years. The editor says that marriages
L07 0340 10    may be made in heaven, but weddings are made in Mrs.
L07 0350  8    Calhoun's columns. She's the one who decides which
L07 0360  6    wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper
L07 0370  2    and all that". He smiled. "Once, when the editor was
L07 0380  1    just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation,
L07 0380 10    Mrs. Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to
L07 0390 10    his house and fought it out beside his bed. She'd be
L07 0400  6    sure to remember any bride who was vague about background.
L07 0410  2    She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking
L07 0420  1    down heredity and environment. She'd also remember
L07 0420  8    if the groom died later". He stood up. "I wish you
L07 0430  9    good luck, but please don't dig up too tough a case
L07 0440  7    for me this close to election. If you find out anything,
L07 0450  4    come on back here and we'll get started on it".
L07 0460  1       Tracking down Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch
L07 0460 10    up with Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord.
L07 0470  7    It turned out that she also sold real estate, cosmetics,
L07 0480  7    and hospital insurance. The wearying trek stretched
L07 0490  3    into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance
L07 0500  1    office to her house and back to the newspaper, where
L07 0500 11    he found her at five o'clock.
L07 0510  5       She was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle
L07 0520  2    cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth
L07 0520 13    while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter. It
L07 0530 10    took a couple of minutes to run through her various
L07 0550  1    businesses and get down to the one he wanted.
L07 0560  1       "Last year? Well, I do remember one. From Baton
L07 0570  1    Rouge. Married a man named Vincent Black. I remember
L07 0570 10    her because she didn't want her picture in the paper.
L07 0580  9    First bride like that I've seen in twenty-five years".
L07 0590  6       "What reason did she give"?
L07 0600  1       "Said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort
L07 0610  1    of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough.
L07 0610 12    I didn't see her till several days later at the wedding,
L07 0620 10    and her face looked like it had never had a blemish
L07 0630  2    on it. But, of course, you couldn't see too well through
L07 0640  5    the veil".
L07 0640  7       "Was her name Lisa Carmody"?
L07 0650  1       "Now how in hell would I remember that"?
L07 0660  1       "Never mind. I can look it up. Do they still live
L07 0660 12    here"?
L07 0670  1       "I think they moved away shortly after they were
L07 0670 10    married. He was a salesman for something or other and
L07 0680  9    must have been transferred. I'm sure it'll be in the
L07 0690  7    files. We usually run a social note when somebody moves
L07 0710  3    away".
L07 0710  4       He stood up and thanked her.
L07 0720  1       "Have they inherited some money or something"? she
L07 0720  8    asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye.
L07 0730  6       He said vaguely, "Well, it is a little legal matter,
L07 0740  5    but nothing like that".
L07 0740  9       He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the
L07 0750  7    sheriff just as he was leaving.
L07 0760  1       "Sounds like what you're after", he said when Hank
L07 0760 10    had finished. "Come on, let's hurry down before they
L07 0770  9    lock up for the day".
L07 0780  2       In the basement the sheriff took him to a small,
L07 0780 12    dingy office occupied by a tall, thin man informal
L07 0790  9    in rolled-up shirt sleeves.
L07 0800  1       "Mr. Ferrell ... Hirey Lindsay, chairman of the
L07 0800  9    board of supervisors. Mr. Ferrell is a private detective,
L07 0810  9    Hirey. Wants to look up something in the newspaper
L07 0820  8    files, so don't lock him in here".
L07 0830  3       "Sure", said Hirey. "I'll just leave the door open.
L07 0840  3    It latches when you close it, so stay as long as you
L07 0840 15    like".
L07 0850  1       Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with
L07 0850 10    an open grillework in the top half. He pulled it open.
L07 0860 10    "Now don't shut this door. It won't open from inside.
L07 0870  7    Before we built the new jail, we used to keep prisoners
L07 0880  6    in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too
L07 0890  3    crowded. Hirey treats himself a lot better than we
L07 0890 12    do prisoners. They were a sight more comfortable than
L07 0900  8    the ones in the jail with the cold air from Hirey's
L07 0910  6    air conditioner coming through the grille".
L07 0920  1       He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room
L07 0920 10    with shelves full of big, leather-bound volumes from
L07 0930  9    floor to ceiling all around the walls. A metal table
L07 0940  7    and four chairs stood in the center.
L07 0950  1       "They're all here, back to 1865", Carruthers told
L07 0950  9    him. "It's all right to smoke, but make sure your cigarettes
L07 0960 11    are out before you leave. And, of course, you know
L07 0970  9    not to take clippings".
L07 0980  1       "I'll leave the air conditioner on for you, Mr.
L07 0980 10    Ferrell", said Hirey. "Don't forget to turn it off
L07 0990  9    and close the door good so it'll latch".
L07 1000  5       Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules.
L07 1010  4    When they had gone, he stood for a minute breathing
L07 1020  1    in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the
L07 1020 11    busily thrumming air conditioner couldn't quite dispel.
L07 1030  6    #CHAPTER FOURTEEN#
L07 1030  8    In a tour around the stacks, he found that the earliest
L07 1040 11    volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise
L07 1050  6    around the room. An old weakness for burrowing in records
L07 1060  4    rose up to tempt him.
L07 1060  9       It was, indeed, all here- almost a century. From
L07 1070  7    reconstruction to moon rockets. But he pulled away
L07 1080  4    from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to
L07 1090  1    the newer ones.
L07 1090  4       Last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches
L07 1100  3    below the ceiling. Near it was a metal ladder on casters
L07 1100 14    attached to the top shelf. He pulled it over, climbed
L07 1110 10    up, and lifted out the big volume, almost losing his
L07 1120  7    balance from the weight of it. He staggered over and
L07 1130  4    dropped it on the table.
L07 1130  9       Since Mrs. Calhoun remembered only that the marriage
L07 1140  6    had been in the spring, he started to plod through
L07 1150  4    several months. He tried to turn right to the society
L07 1160  1    page in each one, but interesting stories kept cropping
L07 1160 10    up to distract him. At last he found it in the paper
L07 1170 10    of April 2.
L07 1170 13       It told him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered,
L07 1180 10    stating that it had been a small, modest wedding compared
L07 1190  9    to some of the others.
L07 1200  1       There was a marked contrast in the amount of information
L07 1200 11    on bride and groom. Mr. Black's life was an open book,
L07 1210 10    so to speak, from his birth in Jackson, Mississippi,
L07 1220  6    through his basketball-playing days at L.S.U. and his
L07 1230  6    attainment of a B.A. degree, which had presumably prepared
L07 1240  4    him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless
L07 1250  3    Business Machines.
L07 1250  5       The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa
L07 1260  6    Carmody from Baton Rouge. No mention of New Orleans.
L07 1270  3       Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr.
L07 1280  2    Black. If Mrs. Black was who he thought she was, Mr.
L07 1280 13    Black's Peerless selling days might well be over.
L07 1290  8       Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs. This time
L07 1300  7    the search took twice as long, cutting down on his
L07 1310  5    extra reading, for he had to pick through several columns
L07 1320  2    of one- and two-line social notes in each issue. He
L07 1320 14    found it in the edition of May 15. The item said Mr.
L07 1330 12    and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson, his home town-
L07 1340  8    so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago.
L07 1350  6       Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office
L07 1360  2    of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent
L07 1370  1    Black was still with them- or, more specifically, still
L07 1370 10    with us.
L07 1380  1       He glanced at his watch, saw it was only seven,
L07 1380 11    and decided to indulge his weakness now. For the next
L07 1390  9    hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder, sharing
L07 1400  7    the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinley's
L07 1410  2    assassination, the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago,
L07 1420  1    and the Hall-Mills trial.
L07 1420  6       In the middle of the stock market crash, he heard
L07 1430  4    a slight noise in the outer office. He turned around,
L07 1440  1    saw nothing, and decided it must be a mouse. Something
L07 1440 11    else distracted him, yet there was no sound, only tomblike
L07 1450  9    silence. Then he knew it was not sound, but lack of
L07 1460  8    it. The air conditioner was no longer running.
L07 1470  2       He jumped up and turned around to see the metal
L07 1470 12    door closing. It clanged shut as he sprang toward it.
L07 1480 10       He pressed his face against the grille. "Who's there"?
L07 1490  8       The light shining through the grille dimly illumined
L07 1500  7    the office beyond- enough for him to see there was
L07 1510  7    no one there. Then he heard the outer door closing.
L07 1520  2       "Hey, come back", he shouted. He thought it must
L07 1530  1    be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around,
L07 1530 10    figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn
L07 1540 10    off everything and lock up. _
L07 1550  3       hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his
L07 1550 12    mind. Unless he was stone-blind, the person who'd just
L07 1560  9    left couldn't have missed seeing Hank through the open
L07 1570  6    door of the brightly lighted room. And even if he'd
L07 1580  4    somehow missed seeing him, he wouldn't have gone off
L07 1590  1    and left the light on and door open in the file room.
L07 1590 13       Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here,
L07 1600 11    had followed him and waited till the courthouse and
L07 1610  5    square were deserted. But why? To search his room at
L07 1620  4    the motel? To come back later and kill him after the
L07 1620 15    stores had closed around the square and everybody had
L07 1630  9    left? No, they could kill him just as easy right now.
L07 1650  8    Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground
L07 1660  5    vault.
L07 1660  6       Then he heard it and smelled it- the steady hissing,
L07 1670  6    the dread, familiar pungency of gas escaping. It must
L07 1680  3    be coming from an upright heater against the far wall
L07 1680 13    in the supervisors' office.
L07 1690  3       Until now, Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley had been
L07 1700  3    like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own
L07 1700 13    pace and choosing.
L07 1710  3       Except for those minutes in her room, he had lost
L07 1720  2    touch with her as a reality. Gaylor's obsession and
L07 1720 11    Cunningham's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized
L07 1730  6    him into thinking of Lila and Lilac, separately or
L07 1740  7    together, as a legend. They kept drifting apart and
L07 1750  3    merging again in his mind like some minute form of
L07 1750 13    life on a microscope slide.
