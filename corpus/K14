K14 0010  1    ... he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
K14 0010 12    of about a hundred pounds' weight. They took Jesus's
K14 0020  6    body, then, and wrapped it in winding-clothes with
K14 0030  5    the spices; that is how the Jews prepare a body for
K14 0040  3    burial.
K14 0040  4       Listed as present at the Descent were Mary, Mary's
K14 0050  2    sister, Mary Magdalene, John, Joseph of Arimathea,
K14 0050  9    Nicodemus. Search as he might, he could find no place
K14 0060 10    where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have
K14 0070  9    been alone with Jesus. Mostly the scene was crowded
K14 0080  5    with mourners, such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation
K14 0090  2    in Bologna, where the grief-stricken spectators had
K14 0100  1    usurped Mary's last poignant moment.
K14 0100  6       In his concept there could be no one else present.
K14 0110  6       His first desire was to create a mother and son
K14 0120  4    alone in the universe. When might Mary have had that
K14 0130  1    moment to hold her child on her lap? Perhaps after
K14 0130 11    the soldiers had laid him on the ground, while Joseph
K14 0140  8    of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's asking for Christ's
K14 0150  4    body, Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh
K14 0160  3    and aloes, and the others had gone home to mourn. Those
K14 0170  1    who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of
K14 0170 11    the biblical witnesses. They would feel what Mary was
K14 0180  7    undergoing. There would be no halos, no angels. These
K14 0190  5    would be two human beings, whom God had chosen.
K14 0200  1       He felt close to Mary, having spent so long concentrating
K14 0210  1    on the beginning of her journey. Now she was intensely
K14 0210 11    alive, anguished; her son was dead. Even though he
K14 0220  8    would later be resurrected, he was at this moment dead
K14 0230  7    indeed, the expression on his face reflecting what
K14 0240  2    he had gone through on the cross. In his sculpture
K14 0240 12    therefore it would not be possible for him to project
K14 0250 10    anything of what Jesus felt for his mother; only what
K14 0260  6    Mary felt for her son. Jesus' inert body would be passive,
K14 0270  5    his eyes closed. Mary would have to carry the human
K14 0280  2    communication. This seemed right to him.
K14 0280  8       It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical
K14 0290  8    problems. Since his Christ was to be life size, how
K14 0300  6    was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship
K14 0310  1    seeming ungainly? His Mary would be slender of limb
K14 0310 10    and delicate of proportion, yet she must hold this
K14 0320  9    full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she
K14 0330  5    would a child.
K14 0330  8       There was only one way to accomplish this: by design,
K14 0340  7    by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed
K14 0350  5    the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas
K14 0360  1    to carry his concept.
K14 0360  5       He started by making free sketches to loosen up
K14 0370  2    his thinking so that images would appear on paper.
K14 0370 11    Visually, these approximated what he was feeling within
K14 0380  8    himself. At the same time he started walking the streets,
K14 0390  6    peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls,
K14 0400  4    storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like,
K14 0410  2    how they moved. In particular he sought the gentle,
K14 0410 11    sweet-faced nuns, with head coverings and veils coming
K14 0420  8    to the middle of their foreheads, remembering their
K14 0430  3    expressions until he reached home and set them down
K14 0440  2    on paper.
K14 0440  4       Discovering that draperies could be designed to
K14 0450  2    serve structural purposes, he began a study of the
K14 0450 11    anatomy of folds. He improvised as he went along, completing
K14 0460  8    a life-size clay figure, then bought yards of an inexpensive
K14 0470  7    material from a draper, wet the lightweight cloth in
K14 0480  4    a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento
K14 0490  1    brought from the bank of the Tiber, to the consistency
K14 0490 11    of thick mud. No fold could be accidental, each turn
K14 0500  9    of the drapery had to serve organically, to cover the
K14 0510  5    Madonna's slender legs and feet so that they would
K14 0520  3    give substantive support to Christ's body, to intensify
K14 0530  1    her inner turmoil. When the cloth dried and stiffened,
K14 0530 10    he saw what adjustments had to be made.
K14 0540  6       "So that's sculpture", commented Argiento wryly,
K14 0550  3    when he had sluiced down the floor for a week, "making
K14 0560  1    mud pies".
K14 0560  3       Michelangelo grinned. "See, Argiento, if you control
K14 0570  4    the way these folds are bunched, like this, or made
K14 0570 14    to flow, you can enrich the body attitudes. They can
K14 0580 10    have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone".
K14 0590  6       He went into the Jewish quarter, wanting to draw
K14 0600  4    Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding
K14 0610  1    of how Christ might have looked. The Jewish section
K14 0610 10    was in Trastevere, near the Tiber at the church of
K14 0620 10    San Francesco a Ripa. The colony had been small until
K14 0630  7    the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into
K14 0640  5    Rome. Here, for the most part, they were well treated,
K14 0650  2    as a "reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity";
K14 0660  1    many of their gifted members were prominent in the
K14 0660 10    Vatican as physicians, musicians, bankers.
K14 0670  5       The men did not object to his sketching them while
K14 0680  5    they went about their work, but no one could be persuaded
K14 0690  3    to come to his studio to pose. He was told to ask for
K14 0700  1    Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon.
K14 0700  9    Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study,
K14 0710  8    a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey
K14 0720  4    eyes, robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his
K14 0730  2    head. He was reading from the Talmud with a group of
K14 0730 13    men from his congregation. When Michelangelo explained
K14 0740  5    why he had come, Rabbi Melzi replied gravely:
K14 0750  4       "The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make
K14 0760  5    graven images. That is why our creative people give
K14 0760 14    their time to literature, not to painting or sculpture".
K14 0770  9       "But, Rabbi Melzi, you don't object to others creating
K14 0780  9    works of art"?
K14 0790  1       "Not at all. Each religion has its own tenets".
K14 0800  1       "I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble.
K14 0800 10    I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew. I cannot accomplish
K14 0810  8    this if you will not help me".
K14 0820  3       The rabbi said thoughtfully, "I would not want my
K14 0830  2    people to get in trouble with the Church".
K14 0830 10       "I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi. I'm
K14 0840  8    sure he would approve".
K14 0850  1       "What kind of models would you prefer"?
K14 0850  8       "Workmen. In their mid-thirties. Not bulky laborers,
K14 0860  8    but sinewy men. With intelligence. And sensitivity".
K14 0870  4       Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but
K14 0880  6    merry eyes.
K14 0880  8       "Leave me your address. I will send you the best
K14 0890  7    the quarter has to offer". Michelangelo hurried to
K14 0900  3    Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches,
K14 0910  1    asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate
K14 0910 11    the seated Madonna. Sangallo studied the drawings and
K14 0920  8    improvised a trestle couch. Michelangelo bought some
K14 0930  5    scrap lumber. Together he and Argiento built the stand,
K14 0940  4    covering it with blankets.
K14 0940  8       His first model arrived at dusk. He hesitated for
K14 0950  8    a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe, so
K14 0960  5    Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around
K14 0970  3    his loins, led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes.
K14 0980  1    He then draped him over the rough stand, explained
K14 0980 10    that he was supposed to be recently dead, and was being
K14 0990  8    held on his mother's lap. The model quite plainly thought
K14 1000  5    Michelangelo crazy; only the instructions from his
K14 1010  3    rabbi kept him from bolting. But at the end of the
K14 1010 14    sitting, when Michelangelo showed him the quick, free
K14 1020  8    drawings, with the mother roughed in, holding her son,
K14 1030  7    the model grasped what Michelangelo was after, and
K14 1040  4    promised to speak to his friends ... He worked for
K14 1050  1    two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi.
K14 1050 12       Mary presented quite a different problem. Though
K14 1060  6    this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after
K14 1070  3    her moment of decision, he could not conceive of her
K14 1080  3    as a woman in her mid-fifties, old, wrinkled, broken
K14 1080 13    in body and face by labor or worry. His image of the
K14 1090 10    Virgin had always been that of a young woman, even
K14 1100  6    as had his memory of his mother.
K14 1100 13       Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes.
K14 1110  8    Here he sketched, sitting in their flowing gowns of
K14 1120  7    linen and silk, young girls not yet twenty, some about
K14 1130  4    to be married, some married a year or two. Since the
K14 1140  2    Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men, he had had
K14 1140 12    no experience in the study of female anatomy; but he
K14 1150  9    had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and
K14 1160  6    homes. He was able to discern the body lines of the
K14 1170  4    Roman women under their robes.
K14 1170  9       He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures
K14 1180  6    together: a Mary who would be young and sensitive,
K14 1190  3    yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and a
K14 1200  2    Jesus who, though lean, was strong even in death ...
K14 1200 12    a look he remembered well from his experience in the
K14 1210  7    dead room of Santo Spirito. He drew toward the composite
K14 1220  6    design from his meticulously accurate memory, without
K14 1230  2    need to consult his sketches.
K14 1230  7       Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional
K14 1240  7    figure in clay. Here he would have free expression
K14 1250  2    because the material could be moved to distort forms.
K14 1250 11    When he wanted to emphasize, or get greater intensity,
K14 1260  9    he added or subtracted clay. Next he turned to wax
K14 1270  7    because there was a similarity of wax to marble in
K14 1280  5    tactile quality and translucence. He respected each
K14 1290  1    of these approach techniques, and kept them in character:
K14 1290 10    his quill drawings had a scratchiness, suggesting skin
K14 1300  7    texture; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft
K14 1310  5    moving flesh, as in an abdomen, in a reclining torso;
K14 1320  2    the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an
K14 1330  1    elastic pull. Yet he never allowed these models to
K14 1330 10    become fixed in his mind; they remained rough starting
K14 1340  6    points. When carving he was charged with spontaneous
K14 1350  3    energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay and
K14 1360  2    wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of
K14 1360 13    his model.
K14 1370  1       The true surge had to be inside the marble itself.
K14 1370 11    Drawing and models were his thinking. Carving was action.
K14 1380  8    #10.#
K14 1380  9    The arrangement with Argiento was working well, except
K14 1390  7    that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was
K14 1400  6    master and who apprentice. Argiento had been trained
K14 1410  3    so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was
K14 1410 11    unable to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub
K14 1420 10    the floors, whether they were dirty or not; water boiling
K14 1430  8    on the fire for washing laundry every day, the pots
K14 1440  5    scoured with river sand after each meal.
K14 1450  1       "Argiento, this is senseless", he complained, not
K14 1450  8    liking to work on the wet floors, particularly in cold
K14 1460  8    weather. "You're too clean. Scrub the studio once a
K14 1470  6    week. That's enough".
K14 1470  9       "No", said Argiento stolidly. "Every day. Before
K14 1480  7    dawn. I was taught".
K14 1490  1       "And God help anyone who tries to unteach you"!
K14 1500  1    grumbled Michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing
K14 1500 10    to grumble about, for Argiento made few demands on
K14 1510  8    him. The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini
K14 1520  4    families that brought produce into Rome. On Sundays
K14 1530  3    he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with
K14 1540  1    them, and in particular to see their horses. The one
K14 1540 11    thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was
K14 1550  9    the animals; frequently he would take his leave of
K14 1560  5    Michelangelo by announcing:
K14 1560  8       "Today I go see the horses".
K14 1570  6       It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo
K14 1580  2    that the boy was devoted to him. He was crouched over
K14 1580 13    his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into
K14 1590  9    trim, when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and
K14 1600  8    imbedded itself in his pupil. He stumbled into the
K14 1610  3    house, eyes burning like fire. Argiento made him lie
K14 1620  1    down on the bed, brought a pan of hot water, dipped
K14 1620 12    some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract
K14 1630  7    the splinter. Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo
K14 1640  3    was not too concerned. He assumed he could blink the
K14 1650  3    splinter out. But it would not come. Argiento never
K14 1650 12    left his side, keeping the water boiled, applying hot
K14 1660  9    compresses throughout the night.
K14 1670  3       By the second day Michelangelo began to worry; and
K14 1680  2    by the second night he was in a state of panic: he
K14 1680 14    could see nothing out of the afflicted eye. At dawn
K14 1690  8    Argiento went to Jacopo Galli. Galli arrived with his
K14 1700  5    family surgeon, Maestro Lippi. The surgeon carried
K14 1710  2    a cage of live pigeons. He told Argiento to take a
K14 1710 13    bird out of the cage, cut a large vein under its wing,
K14 1720 12    let the blood gush into Michelangelo's injured eye.
K14 1730  5       The surgeon came back at dusk, cut the vein of a
K14 1740  7    second pigeon, again washed out the eye.
