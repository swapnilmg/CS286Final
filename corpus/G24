G24 0010  1    The President's personality would have opened that
G24 0010  8    office to him. And for the first time a representative
G24 0020  8    of the highest office in the land would have been liable
G24 0030  6    to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship
G24 0040  4    by inheritance. It is testimony to the deep respect
G24 0050  1    in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all
G24 0050 11    parties that the moral considerations raised by his
G24 0060  7    approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached.
G24 0070  6       These began to be apparent in a press conference
G24 0080  3    held during the second illness in order that the consulting
G24 0090  1    specialists might clarify the President's condition
G24 0090  7    for the nation. And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled
G24 0100  8    thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession,
G24 0110  7    his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a
G24 0120  4    good deal more. It forced us to fix the responsibility
G24 0130  1    for the position in which all medical commentators
G24 0130  9    had been placed. The discussion of professional ethics
G24 0140  7    inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective
G24 0150  7    the President's decision will finally clarify itself
G24 0160  4    as a moral, rather than a medical, problem. Because
G24 0170  1    the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with
G24 0170  9    the President, rather than with his doctors, nothing
G24 0180  7    raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness
G24 0190  5    faces in dealing with complex moral problems under
G24 0200  2    political pressure. For the President had dealt with
G24 0200 10    the matter humbly, in what he conceived as the democratic
G24 0210 10    way. But the problem is one which gives us the measure
G24 0220  9    of a man, rather than a group of men, whether a group
G24 0230  6    of doctors, a group of party members assembled at a
G24 0240  3    dinner to give their opinion, or the masses of the
G24 0240 13    voters.
G24 0250  1       Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central
G24 0250 10    issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the
G24 0260 10    man who could not conceive it as the central issue
G24 0270  6    will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic
G24 0280  2    and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors
G24 0280 11    and President in a situation which should never have
G24 0290  9    arisen. It was a response to the conflict between political
G24 0300  7    pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in
G24 0310  4    attempts at prediction. In no other situation would
G24 0320  2    a group of doctors, struggling competently to improve
G24 0320 10    the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world,
G24 0330  9    be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning,
G24 0340  4    and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind
G24 0350  3    of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind
G24 0360  1    the problems it faces. And though we can look back
G24 0360 11    now and see their errors, we can look back also to
G24 0370  8    the ultimate error.
G24 0370 11       It recurred in the press conferences: the President's
G24 0380  7    remarks about his running developed a singular tone,
G24 0390  5    one which we find in few statements made by public
G24 0400  4    individuals on such a matter. The press conference
G24 0400 12    became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private
G24 0410 10    thinking, rather than his convictions. He commented-
G24 0420  5    thoughtfully, a reporter told us- that it was "not
G24 0430  7    too important for the individual how he ends up". He
G24 0440  2    gave us a simile to explain his admission that even
G24 0440 12    at the worst period of his second illness it never
G24 0450  8    occurred to him there was any renewed question about
G24 0460  4    his running: as in the Battle of the Bulge, he had
G24 0470  3    no fears about the outcome until he read the American
G24 0470 13    newspapers. Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency
G24 0480 10    demands in such a situation is quite distinct from
G24 0490  7    the simple courage that can proceed with battles to
G24 0500  4    be fought, regardless of the consequences. In this
G24 0510  1    case others should not have had to raise the doubts
G24 0510 11    and fears. The Presidency demands an incisive awareness
G24 0520  6    of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent.
G24 0530  7    It is of the utmost importance to the people of America
G24 0540  4    and of the world how their governing President "ends
G24 0550  1    up" during the four years of his term. Only when that
G24 0550 12    term is ended and he is a private citizen again can
G24 0560 10    he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount
G24 0570  6    the dangers of his death. Ironically enough, in this
G24 0580  3    instance such personal virtues were a luxury.
G24 0580 10       At the national and international level, then, what
G24 0590  8    is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen
G24 0600  7    represents an instance of political immorality. And
G24 0610  3    we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the
G24 0620  1    moral and the political progressed amid the events
G24 0620  9    which concern us. For the tone of the editorials which
G24 0630  8    greeted Mr. Eisenhower's original announcement of his
G24 0640  5    running had been strangely disquieting. Neither the
G24 0650  3    vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive
G24 0660  1    sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments
G24 0660 10    nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that
G24 0670  5    something significant has transpired was in evidence.
G24 0680  4    Nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than
G24 0690  1    the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue
G24 0690 10    of Life Magazine, the issue which also carried the
G24 0700  7    second announcement of the candidacy. The double editorial
G24 0710  5    on two aspects of "The U. S. Spirit" was subtly calculated
G24 0720  5    to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well
G24 0730  4    as small, reflecting popular approval of this questionable
G24 0740  1    attitude toward the highest office in the land. "The
G24 0740 10    Moral Creed" and "The Will to Risk" live happily together,
G24 0750 10    if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn.
G24 0760 11    "I may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal
G24 0770  7    person of my age", the President had said on February
G24 0780  4    29th of the election year, ignoring the fact that no
G24 0790  2    one of his age had ever lived out another term. "My
G24 0790 13    doctors assure me that this increased percentage of
G24 0800  7    risk is not great". But by the time the risk was doubled,
G24 0810  7    events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages
G24 0820  3    and a previously stated intention of considering carefully
G24 0830  2    anything more serious than a bout of influenza. Only
G24 0830 11    infrequently did the situation color his thinking.
G24 0840  7    Ironically no president we have had would have regretted
G24 0850  7    more than President Eisenhower the possibility to which
G24 0860  4    his own words, in the press conference held at the
G24 0870  2    beginning of August, testified: that unable as he was
G24 0870 11    himself to say his running was best for the country,
G24 0880 10    unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation.
G24 0890  6       So it is that we relive his opening statement in
G24 0900  3    the first television address with the dramatic immediacy
G24 0910  1    of the present. No consideration of risk urges itself
G24 0910 10    upon him now: for this is what the mind does with the
G24 0920 11    ideas on which it has not properly focussed. Yet with
G24 0930  5    a mind less shallow, if less sharp, than some of the
G24 0940  4    fortune-happy syndicates which back him, he feels what
G24 0950  1    he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones
G24 0950 11    which suggest he could never in any conscience urge
G24 0960  8    a risk upon the voters. Moving as he is into the phase
G24 0970  7    of the campaign which demands conviction of him, he
G24 0980  3    adopts a position that is morally indefensible. He
G24 0980 11    ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal
G24 0990 11    matter- the assurance that he can physically sustain
G24 1000  6    the burden of the office longer than any individual
G24 1010  4    in the history of our nation has been able to do- has
G24 1020  4    brought him. What is simply an opinion formed in defiance
G24 1020 14    of the laws of human probability, whether or not it
G24 1030  9    is later confirmed, has become by September of the
G24 1040  6    election year "a firm conviction". As a means of silencing
G24 1060  5    a discussion which ought to have taken place, the statement
G24 1070  2    is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal
G24 1070 11    confusion which gives rise to such convictions. But
G24 1080  8    it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters
G24 1090  7    in our current political history.
G24 1100  1       In assigning to God the responsibility which he
G24 1100  9    learned could not rest with his doctors, Eisenhower
G24 1110  7    gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition
G24 1120  5    which was to characterize his administration in the
G24 1130  3    years to follow. In any other man this reassurance
G24 1130 12    to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral
G24 1140  8    shock. About this man we had to think twice. We knew
G24 1150  7    that it was, as reassurance, the ironic fruit of a
G24 1160  4    deeply moral nature. But the fact remains that even
G24 1160 13    the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny
G24 1170  9    divinely protected must be censored in any man who
G24 1180  8    evades the responsibility for his major decisions,
G24 1190  2    and thus for imposing his will on the people. And in
G24 1190 13    the context of drifting personal utterances we have
G24 1200  8    examined, there was occasional evidence of the origin
G24 1210  6    of all such evasions. When the possibility that he
G24 1220  3    had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision
G24 1230  1    seemed to disconcert his questioners, Mr. Eisenhower
G24 1240  7    was known to make his characteristic statement to the
G24 1250  7    press that he was not going to talk about the matter
G24 1260  6    any more. Thinking had stopped; it was not to be resumed.
G24 1270  4       The portrait that had developed, fragmentarily but
G24 1280  2    consistently, was the portrait of a man to whom serious
G24 1280 12    thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision
G24 1290 10    inhibits, when it does not forestall, any ability to
G24 1300  5    review the decision in the light of new evidence. This
G24 1310  2    does not mean that the decision to run for office should
G24 1320  1    inevitably have been revoked. Instead it means that
G24 1320  9    the thinking in which decision issues has the power
G24 1330  7    to determine the morality of the decision, as in this
G24 1340  5    instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative
G24 1350  1    attention to the constitutional problems the decision
G24 1350  8    had uncovered might have done. Drifting through a third
G24 1360  8    illness, apparently without any provision for the handling
G24 1370  7    of a major national emergency other than a talk with
G24 1380  6    the vice-president, Eisenhower revealed the singularly
G24 1390  1    static quality of his thinking. Despite three warnings,
G24 1390  9    no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish
G24 1400  9    his situation, and thus his responsibilities, from
G24 1410  5    Wilson's.
G24 1410  6    ##
G24 1410  7    By contrast, the energetic reaction of the leader to
G24 1420  7    the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens
G24 1430  4    the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the
G24 1440  3    man. Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with
G24 1440 12    the detailed considerations following from any decision
G24 1450  6    can he ensure attention to the practical details to
G24 1460  6    be dealt with if the implications of immorality in
G24 1470  2    the major decision are effectively to be checked. In
G24 1470 11    the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political
G24 1480  6    fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in
G24 1490  7    the significant detail, and to articulate the distinctions
G24 1500  3    which clarify the detail as significant, with what
G24 1510  1    is sometimes astounding rapidity. Like Lincoln, he
G24 1510  8    can distinguish his relation to God from the constitutional
G24 1520  8    responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of
G24 1530  4    him. Like Roosevelt, he can distinguish an attitude
G24 1540  2    toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of
G24 1540 13    Americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention
G24 1550  6    may impose upon him. He chooses to subordinate one
G24 1560  6    to the other, sometimes reluctantly, accepting criticism
G24 1570  3    for the lesser immoralities facts breed. The very nature
G24 1580  2    of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads
G24 1580 12    to the valid convictions which become force of will
G24 1590  8    in the manifest leader. The capacity for making the
G24 1600  6    distinctions of which diplomacy is compact, and the
G24 1610  3    facility with language which can render them into validity
G24 1620  1    in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for
G24 1620 12    transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership.
G24 1630  6       The making of distinctions, like the perception
G24 1640  4    of the great distinctions made, is an inordinately
G24 1650  1    difficult business. Lincoln's slow progress towards
G24 1650  7    the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable
G24 1660  8    as such, and loosely interpreted as the alternation
G24 1670  5    of inconsistency with vision. But because it is the
G24 1680  5    function of the mind to turn the one into the other
G24 1690  1    by means of the capacities with which words endow it,
G24 1690 11    we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction,
G24 1700  6    in the sphere of politics, on which decisions hang.
G24 1710  3    Only recently, and perhaps because a television debate
G24 1720  1    can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary
G24 1730  1    mastery of detail, have the abilities on which the
G24 1730 10    capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be
G24 1740  6    clearly discernible at the level of politics. In his
G24 1760  3    recent evaluation of Kennedy's potentialities for leadership,
G24 1770  2    Walter Lippmann has cited the "precision" of his mind,
G24 1780  1    his "immense command" of factual detail, and his "instinct
G24 1780 10    for the crucial point" as impressive in the extreme;
G24 1790  9    and it is surely clear that the first of these is the
G24 1800  9    result of the way in which the individual's command
G24 1810  3    of language interacts with the other two.
