A38 0010  1       The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what
A38 0010  9    it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.
A38 0020  9    Gary Player, the small, trim South African, was the
A38 0030  6    eventual winner, but in all his 25 years he never spent
A38 0040  5    a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory
A38 0050  2    to drop in his lap. Arnold Palmer, the defending champion,
A38 0050 12    lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes
A38 0060 11    of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping
A38 0070  7    in disbelief.
A38 0070  9       "Just when you think you have it licked, this golf
A38 0080  8    course can get up and bite you", Player had said one
A38 0090  5    afternoon midway through the tournament. And that is
A38 0100  3    just what happened on the last few holes. The Augusta
A38 0100 13    National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player
A38 0110 10    and Palmer.
A38 0120  1       Player was the first to feel its teeth. After playing
A38 0120 11    a splendid first nine holes in 34- two strokes under
A38 0130  8    par- on this fifth and final day of the tournament
A38 0140  5    (Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent
A38 0150  4    rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's
A38 0160  1    game rapidly fell to pieces. He bogeyed the 10th. After
A38 0160 11    a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed
A38 0170  7    the 13th. He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt
A38 0180  6    and finally scrambled through the last three holes
A38 0190  2    without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole
A38 0190 15    total of 280.
A38 0200  3       As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course,
A38 0210  1    Player was almost in tears. He could read on the nearby
A38 0210 12    scoreboard that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole,
A38 0220  9    was leading him by a stroke. Palmer had started the
A38 0230  5    round four strokes behind Player, and at one point
A38 0240  3    in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.
A38 0240 14    Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect
A38 0250 13    the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf.
A38 0260  6       When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway
A38 0270  5    on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship
A38 0280  1    won. But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the
A38 0280 12    green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight
A38 0290 10    depression. In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge
A38 0300  8    Palmer bounced the ball over the green, past spectators
A38 0310  3    and down the slope toward a TV tower.
A38 0310 11       Afterwards, Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round
A38 0320  8    partner, that he simply played the hole too fast. He
A38 0330  8    did seem hasty on his second and third shots, but then
A38 0340  5    there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while
A38 0350  1    Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to
A38 0350 10    recover his composure, which he had quite visibly lost.
A38 0360  7       When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth
A38 0370  6    shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet. Palmer was now
A38 0380  4    putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting
A38 0390  1    beside his wife and watching it all on television in
A38 0390 11    Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment,
A38 0400  5    stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt.
A38 0410  5       Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was
A38 0420  4    a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest
A38 0430  1    pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place
A38 0430 12    tie with Coe. The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur,
A38 0440  7    who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many
A38 0450  5    years, refused to let the Masters jitters overtake
A38 0460  2    him and closed the tournament with his second straight
A38 0460 11    69.
A38 0470  1    #END AT SEVEN#
A38 0470  3    Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played
A38 0480  1    seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters- four
A38 0480 10    last year and three this- without ever being out of
A38 0490  9    first place. As evening approached and Palmer finished
A38 0500  5    his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par
A38 0510  4    73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks
A38 0510 12    to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69. His
A38 0520 11    three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than
A38 0530  8    the next best score, a 213 by Bill Collins, the tall
A38 0540  4    and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very
A38 0550  2    well all winter long.
A38 0550  6       But Palmer knew, as did everybody else at Augusta,
A38 0560  4    that his streak was about to be broken. Half an hour
A38 0570  1    after he finished his round, Player holed out at the
A38 0570 11    18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206,
A38 0580 10    four strokes ahead of Palmer.
A38 0590  1       More than a streak had ended. Long after the erratic
A38 0590 11    climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have
A38 0600 10    become meteorological footnotes, the 1961 Masters will
A38 0610  6    be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between
A38 0620  5    Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. Unlike most such sports
A38 0630  3    rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously,
A38 0640  1    although this was not exactly the case.
A38 0640  8       When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January
A38 0650  8    there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering
A38 0660  4    prestige. As if to confirm his stature, he quickly
A38 0670  3    won three of the first eight tournaments. Player won
A38 0670 12    only one. But as the tour reached Pensacola a month
A38 0680 10    ago, Player was leading Palmer in official winnings
A38 0690  6    by a few hundred dollars, and the rest of the field
A38 0700  5    was somewhere off in nowhere. On the final round at
A38 0710  1    Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player
A38 0710 11    in the same threesome and, although it was far from
A38 0720  8    obvious at the time, the gallery was treated to the
A38 0730  5    first chapter of what promises to be one of the most
A38 0740  3    exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.
A38 0740 13       On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer
A38 0750  8    nor Player was leading the tournament and, as it turned
A38 0760  7    out, neither won it. But whichever of these two finished
A38 0770  5    ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial
A38 0780  1    leader of the tour. Player immediately proved he was
A38 0780 10    not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of
A38 0790  8    Palmer. He outplayed Palmer all around the course and
A38 0800  6    finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71. Thereafter,
A38 0810  3    until the Masters, Player gradually increased his lead
A38 0820  3    over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament
A38 0820 12    victory at Miami. When they reached Augusta last week,
A38 0830  9    together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to
A38 0840  8    date.
A38 0840  9    #INSTANT RIVALRY#
A38 0840 11    On Thursday, the first day of the Masters, the contest
A38 0850  9    between Palmer and Player developed instantly. It was
A38 0860  6    a dismal, drizzly day but a good one on which to score
A38 0870  6    over the Augusta National course. The usually skiddy
A38 0880  2    greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able
A38 0880 12    to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick
A38 0890  9    and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry
A38 0900  7    about the consequences. Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got
A38 0910  3    him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob
A38 0910 14    Rosburg. But Player was only one stroke back, with
A38 0920  9    a 69.
A38 0920 11       Even so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous
A38 0930 12    horde of spectators- unquestionably the largest golf
A38 0940  7    crowd ever- that this tournament was to be, essentially,
A38 0950  5    a match between Palmer and Player. A lot of people
A38 0960  3    were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular
A38 0970  1    young amateur, who had a 70; or Ken Venturi, who had
A38 0970 12    a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better; or
A38 0980  9    Rosburg, whose accurate short game and supersensitive
A38 0990  4    putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries;
A38 1000  1    or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one
A38 1010  1    wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.
A38 1010 11    (On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking
A38 1020  7    of Charlie Coe.)
A38 1030  1       On Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday
A38 1030 10    had been gray and ugly, the plot of the tournament
A38 1040  7    came clearly into focus. Rosburg had started early
A38 1050  4    in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were
A38 1060  1    on the course- separated, as they were destined to
A38 1060 10    be for the rest of the weekend, by about half an hour-
A38 1080  6    they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted
A38 1090  3    around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a 73,
A38 1100  2    was not having a good day.
A38 1100  8       As Player began his second round in a twosome with
A38 1110  5    amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery was
A38 1120  2    not conspicuously large for a contender. Player began
A38 1120 10    with a birdie on the first hole, added five straight
A38 1130  8    pars and then another birdie at the 9th. On the back
A38 1140  7    nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery
A38 1150  3    that stayed with him the rest of the tournament. He
A38 1150 13    birdied the 13th, the 15th and the 18th- five birdies,
A38 1160 10    one bogey and 12 pars for a 68.
A38 1170  4       Starting half an hour behind Player in company with
A38 1180  1    British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the
A38 1180  9    2nd, the 9th, the 13th and the 16th- four birdies,
A38 1190  9    one bogey and 13 pars for a 69. The roar of Palmer's
A38 1200  7    gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out
A38 1210  3    across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be
A38 1210 12    answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery
A38 1220  9    for a similar triumph. At one point late in the day,
A38 1230  8    when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th,
A38 1240  5    a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green
A38 1250  2    unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the
A38 1250  9    final hole. Without so much as a grimace or a gesture
A38 1260 10    to show that he had noticed (although he later admitted
A38 1270  5    that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer,
A38 1280  4    and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling
A38 1290  1    back along the intervening fairways in reply.
A38 1290  8    #THE BOLDNESS OF CHAMPIONS#
A38 1300  1    Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under
A38 1300 11    way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted
A38 1310  9    golfers were playing this most difficult golf course.
A38 1320  6    It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the
A38 1330  4    game of golf for any period of time attack their shots
A38 1340  1    with a vehemence bordering on violence. The bad luck
A38 1340 10    that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is
A38 1350  9    simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous
A38 1360  4    boldness of these champions. Bob Jones played that
A38 1370  2    way. Byron Nelson did, Hogan did. And last week at
A38 1370 12    the Masters Palmer and Player did.
A38 1380  5       As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday
A38 1390  4    and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's
A38 1400  1    superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.
A38 1400  9    This day Palmer had started first. As Player stepped
A38 1410  9    on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the
A38 1420  8    first two holes and already was 2 under par for the
A38 1430  6    day. Player immediately proceeded to follow suit. In
A38 1440  2    fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well,
A38 1440 14    to go 4 under par for the first eight holes.
A38 1450  7       But Player's real test came on the ninth hole, a
A38 1460  6    downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards. He
A38 1470  2    hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods
A38 1470 14    separating the 9th and first fairways. Having hit one
A38 1480  9    of the trees, the ball came to rest not more than 160
A38 1490  7    yards out. Player then had the choice of punching the
A38 1500  3    ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and
A38 1500 14    settling for a bogey 5, or gambling. The latter involved
A38 1510 10    hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and
A38 1520  9    toward the clubhouse, hoping to slice it back to the
A38 1530  6    deeply bunkered 9th green.
A38 1530 10       "I was hitting the ball well", Player said later,
A38 1540  7    "and I felt strong. When you're playing like that you'd
A38 1550  6    better attack".
A38 1550  8       Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot
A38 1560  9    that few who saw it will ever forget. It struck the
A38 1570  5    9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge.
A38 1580  2    From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a
A38 1580 13    par 4.
A38 1590  1       Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles.
A38 1590  8    They started on the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3. On
A38 1600 10    this day the wind had switched 180` from the northwest
A38 1610  4    to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the course
A38 1620  2    was different from the previous few days. At the 4th
A38 1620 12    tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood
A38 1630 11    was the proper club, so he put the ball in a bunker
A38 1640  8    in front of the green. His bogey 4 on this hole and
A38 1650  3    subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at
A38 1650 14    8 brought him back to even par.
A38 1660  6       Starting the second nine, Palmer was already four
A38 1670  3    strokes behind Player and knew it.
