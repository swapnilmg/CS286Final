J34 0010  1       It is obvious enough that linguists in general have
J34 0010 10    been less successful in coping with tone systems than
J34 0020  8    with consonants or vowels. No single explanation is
J34 0030  5    adequate to account for this. Improvement, however,
J34 0040  2    is urgent, and at least three things will be needed.
J34 0050  1       The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful
J34 0050 10    tonal analyses. Even beginning students in linguistics
J34 0060  5    are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant
J34 0070  4    systems, both in their general outlines and in many
J34 0080  2    specific details. An advanced student has read a considerable
J34 0090  1    number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including
J34 0090  8    some of the more unusual types. By contrast, even experienced
J34 0100  7    linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities
J34 0110  8    in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between
J34 0120  3    register and contour languages. This limited familiarity
J34 0130  2    with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work
J34 0140  1    with tone. Tone analysis will continue to be difficult
J34 0140 10    and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection
J34 0150  6    of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist.
J34 0160  5    Papers like these four, if widely read, will contribute
J34 0170  3    importantly to improvement of our analytic work.
J34 0180  1       The second need is better field techniques. The
J34 0180  9    great majority of present-day linguists fall into one
J34 0190  8    or more of a number of overlapping types: those who
J34 0210  4    are convinced that tone cannot be analysed, those who
J34 0220  1    are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally,
J34 0220 10    those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary
J34 0230  9    marginal feature in those languages where it occurs,
J34 0240  6    those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis,
J34 0250  4    those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter.
J34 0260  2    The result has been neglect, fumbling efforts, or superficial
J34 0270  1    treatment. As these maladies overlap, so must the cure.
J34 0270 10    Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat
J34 0280  7    the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it
J34 0290  6    is simple. They will give suggestions that can be worked
J34 0300  4    up into field procedures. Good field techniques will
J34 0300 12    not only equip linguists for better work, but also
J34 0310  9    help them overcome negative attitudes. Actually, none
J34 0320  4    of these papers says much directly about field techniques.
J34 0330  3    But it is worth pondering that very little has been
J34 0340  2    published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics.
J34 0340 11    These things have been disseminated by other means,
J34 0350  8    but always in the wake of extensive publication of
J34 0360  5    analytic results.
J34 0360  7       The third need is for better theory. We should expect
J34 0370  8    that general phonologic theory should be as adequate
J34 0380  5    for tone as for consonants and vowels, but it has not
J34 0390  2    been. This can only be for one of two reasons: either
J34 0390 13    the two are quite different and will require totally
J34 0400  8    different theory (and hence techniques), or our existing
J34 0410  5    theories are insufficiently general. If, as I suspect,
J34 0420  5    the problem is largely of the second sort, then development
J34 0430  1    of a theory better able to handle tone will result
J34 0430 11    automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.
J34 0440  8       One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty
J34 0450  9    of analysis of different phonologic subsystems. Since
J34 0460  4    tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either
J34 0470  4    consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they
J34 0480  1    would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis.
J34 0480 10    Actual practice does not often work out this way. Tone
J34 0490  9    systems are certainly more complex than the number
J34 0500  4    of units would suggest, and often analytically more
J34 0510  2    difficult than much larger consonantal systems.
J34 0510  8       Welmers has suggested one explanation. Tone languages
J34 0520  6    use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which
J34 0530  4    also function heavily in nonlinguistic use. This may
J34 0540  3    both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause
J34 0540 12    confusion for the more knowledgeable. The problem is
J34 0550  8    to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from
J34 0560  6    the co-occurring nonlinguistic features. Of course,
J34 0570  3    something of the same sort occurs with other sectors
J34 0570 12    of the phonology: consonantal articulations have both
J34 0580  7    a linguistic and an individual component. But in general
J34 0590  7    the individual variation is a small thing added onto
J34 0600  6    basic linguistic features of greater magnitude. With
J34 0610  2    tone, individual differences may be greater than the
J34 0610 10    linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them.
J34 0620  7    Pitch differences from one speaker to another, or from
J34 0630  7    one emotional state to another, may far exceed the
J34 0640  3    small differences between tones. However, any such
J34 0640 10    suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties
J34 0650  8    in hearing tone, or in developing a realistic attitude
J34 0660  5    about tone, but not for the analytic difficulties that
J34 0670  3    occur even when tone is meticulously recorded.
J34 0680  1       A second explanation is suggested by the material
J34 0680  9    described in Rowlands' paper. Tone and intonation often
J34 0690  6    become seriously intermeshed. Neither can be adequately
J34 0700  5    systematized until we are able to separate the two
J34 0710  3    and assign the observed phenomena individually to one
J34 0710 11    or the other. Other pairs of phonologic subsystems
J34 0720  7    also interact or overlap in this way; for example,
J34 0730  6    duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system
J34 0740  3    and the intonation. Some phonetic features, for example
J34 0750  1    glottal catch or murmur, are sometimes to be assigned
J34 0750 10    to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems.
J34 0760  6    But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult
J34 0770  5    to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages.
J34 0780  3    This explanation of tone difficulties, however, does
J34 0790  1    not apply in all languages. In some (the Ewe type mentioned
J34 0790 12    above) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted
J34 0800  8    to the ends of intonation spans. In many of the syllables,
J34 0810  7    intonation can be safely ignored, and much of the tonal
J34 0820  6    analysis can be done without any study of intonation.
J34 0830  1    Still, even in such languages tone analysis has not
J34 0830 10    been as simple as one might expect.
J34 0840  6       A third explanation is suggested by Richardson's
J34 0850  3    analysis of Sukuma tone. There we see a basically simple
J34 0860  2    phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling
J34 0860 11    morphophonemic system. While the phonemes can be very
J34 0870  8    easily stated, no one is likely to be satisfied with
J34 0880  7    the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related
J34 0890  4    in some way to morphemic units, i.e. until the morphophonemics
J34 0900  1    is worked out, or at least far enough that it seems
J34 0900 12    reasonable to expect success.
J34 0910  4       In the "typical tone language", tonal morphophonemics
J34 0920  3    is of the same order of complexity as consonantal
J34 0930  1    morphophonemics.
J34 0930  2    The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic
J34 0940  1    systems, however, are very different. The inventory
J34 0940  8    of tones is much smaller, and commonly the contrasts
J34 0950  8    range along one single dimension, pitch level. Consonantal
J34 0960  5    systems are not merely larger, they are multidimensional.
J34 0970  3    Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain
J34 0980  2    points in the system. The possibilities in the consonantal
J34 0990  1    system are very numerous, and only a small portion
J34 0990 10    of them are actually used. Phonemes connected by a
J34 1000  6    morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic
J34 1010  6    similarity, possible because of the several dimensions
J34 1020  1    of contrast in the system. Tonal morphophonemics, in
J34 1020  9    a common case, can do nothing but either raise or lower
J34 1030 10    the tone. The possibilities are few, and the total
J34 1040  6    number of rules may be considerably greater. Often,
J34 1050  2    therefore, there are a number of rules having the same
J34 1060  1    effect, and commonly other sets of rules as well, having
J34 1060 11    the opposite effect. Tonal morphophonemics is much
J34 1070  6    more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal
J34 1080  4    morphophonemics, even when the total number of rules
J34 1090  3    is no greater.
J34 1090  6       The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the
J34 1100  3    phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller
J34 1100 12    systems are more troublesome- for any given degree
J34 1110  8    of morphophonemic complexity. This hypothesis will
J34 1120  5    account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal
J34 1130  3    analysis, as well as the fact that vowel systems are
J34 1140  1    often more puzzling than consonantal systems. The statement
J34 1140  9    of the system is a different matter. Smaller systems
J34 1150  7    can of course be stated much more succinctly. A phonemic
J34 1160  6    system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics,
J34 1170  3    but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics.
J34 1180  1    And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in
J34 1180 10    relation to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic
J34 1190 10    system will be analysed without close attention to
J34 1200  5    the morphophonemics- at least, the less satisfying
J34 1210  2    will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related
J34 1210 12    through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful
J34 1220  6    structures.
J34 1230  1       The design of orthographies has received much less
J34 1230  9    attention from linguists than the problem deserves.
J34 1240  6    There has been a tendency on the part of many American
J34 1250  5    linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will
J34 1260  2    automatically be the best possible orthography and
J34 1260  9    that the only real problem will then be the social
J34 1270  8    one of securing acceptance. This seems naive. Most
J34 1280  4    others have been content to give only the most general
J34 1290  2    attention to the broadest and most obvious features
J34 1290 10    of the phonology when designing orthographies. Apparently
J34 1300  5    the feeling is that anything more would be involvement
J34 1310  6    in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest
J34 1320  3    but of no visible significance in practical affairs.
J34 1330  1    The result of this attitude has been the domination
J34 1330 10    of many orthography conferences by such considerations
J34 1340  5    as typographic 'esthetics', which usually turns out
J34 1350  5    to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried
J34 1360  2    over from European languages. Many of the suggested
J34 1360 10    systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship
J34 1370  9    to the language structures that they purport to represent.
J34 1380  6    Linguists have not always been more enlightened than
J34 1390  4    "practical people" and sometimes have insisted on incredibly
J34 1400  3    trivial points while neglecting things of much greater
J34 1410  1    significance. As a result, many people have been confirmed
J34 1410 10    in their conviction that orthography design is not
J34 1420  7    an activity to which experts can contribute anything
J34 1430  4    but confusion.
J34 1430  6       A. E. Sharp, in Vowel-Length and Syllabicity in
J34 1440  7    Kikuyu, examines one set of related orthographic questions
J34 1450  3    and its phonologic background in detail. His objective
J34 1460  2    is merely to determine "what distinctions of length
J34 1460 10    and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit
J34 1470  9    in a Kikuyu orthography" (59). To do so, he finds it
J34 1480  8    necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology
J34 1490  5    thoroughly and in detail. In the process, he develops
J34 1500  2    some very significant observations about problems of
J34 1500  9    a sort that are often difficult. A few of his examples
J34 1510 10    are of very great interest, and the whole discussion
J34 1520  5    of some importance for theory. His orthographic recommendations
J34 1530  2    are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one
J34 1540  3    hand or of superficiality on the other. Rather he weighs
J34 1540 13    each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic
J34 1550  9    usefulness. He concludes that some changes can made
J34 1560  6    in the current orthography which will appreciably improve
J34 1570  3    its usefulness, but hesitates to suggest precise graphic
J34 1580  2    devices to effect these changes. I hope his suggestions
J34 1580 11    are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu
J34 1590  8    circles. This, however, will not exhaust their practical
J34 1600  6    usefulness, as they rather clearly indicate what thorough
J34 1610  4    phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography
J34 1620  1    design. We need many more studies of this sort if the
J34 1620 12    design of written languages is to be put on a sound
J34 1630 11    basis.
J34 1630 12       One other paper deals with a phonologic problem:
J34 1640  7    Vowel Harmony in Igbo, by J. Carnochan. This restates
J34 1650  5    the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies.
J34 1660  3    As a restatement it makes only a small contribution
J34 1670  1    to knowledge of Igbo. But it would seem more intended
J34 1670 11    as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper
J34 1680  7    directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology.
J34 1690  4    The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy
J34 1700  2    introduction to this approach, particularly since it
J34 1700  9    treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon
J34 1710  7    where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional
J34 1720  8    (though not structural) statement. It does show one
J34 1730  5    feature of the system that has not been previously
J34 1740  1    described. But it does not, as it claims, demonstrate
J34 1740 10    that this could not be treated by traditional methods.
J34 1750  7    It seems to me that it rather easily can.
J34 1760  3       Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems.
J34 1770  1    On the whole they maintain much the same high standard,
J34 1770 11    but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail
J34 1780  9    because of their wider variety of subject matter. My
J34 1790  6    comments must be briefer than the papers deserve.
J34 1800  2       W. H. Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical in Iraqw.
J34 1810  3    This must be considered primarily an amendment and
J34 1810 11    supplement to his early A short Description of Item-Categories
J34 1820 10    in Iraqw. It exhibits much the same descriptive technique
J34 1830  8    and is open to much the same criticisms. The treatment
J34 1840  6    seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex, largely
J34 1850  4    because the method is lax and the analysis seems never
J34 1860  2    to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent
J34 1860 12    stopping-point.
