G55 0010  1    ##
G55 0010  2    It was not until we had returned to the city to live,
G55 0010 14    while I was still at Brown and Sharpe's, that I felt
G55 0020 10    the full impact of evangelical Christianity. I came
G55 0030  5    under the spell of a younger group in the church led
G55 0040  5    by the pastor's older son. The spirit of this group
G55 0050  1    was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed
G55 0050 12    to eternal punishment, but that God through Jesus Christ
G55 0060  8    has provided a way of escape for those who confess
G55 0070  6    their sins and accept salvation.
G55 0080  1       There are millions who accept this doctrine, but
G55 0080  9    few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the
G55 0090  8    fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night
G55 0100  4    and day. This group in Park Place Church was made up
G55 0110  2    of the earnest few. I was drawn deeper and deeper into
G55 0110 13    these concerns and responsibilities. I engaged more
G55 0120  6    and more in religious activities. Besides Church and
G55 0130  4    Sunday School I went to out-of-door meetings on the
G55 0140  3    sidewalk at the church door. I went to an afternoon
G55 0140 13    service at the YMCA. I went to the Christian Endeavor
G55 0150 10    Society and to the evening service of the church. Much
G55 0160 10    of this lacked the active support of the pastor. The
G55 0170  6    young people were self-energizing, and I was energized.
G55 0180  4    Once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing
G55 0190  1    a bit in my churchgoing.
G55 0190  6       Meanwhile I myself was not yet saved. At least I
G55 0200  5    had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion.
G55 0210  2    Try as I might to confess my sins and accept salvation,
G55 0220  1    no answer came to me from heaven. Finally, after years,
G55 0220 11    I gave up.
G55 0230  1       The basic difficulty, I suppose, was in my ultimate
G55 0230 10    inability to feel a burden of sin from which I sought
G55 0240 11    relief. I was familiar with Pilgrim's Progress, which
G55 0250  5    I read as literature. No load of sin had been laid
G55 0260  6    on my shoulders, nor did earnest effort enable me to
G55 0270  3    become conscious of one.
G55 0270  7       There is, of course, the doctrine of original sin,
G55 0280  4    which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes
G55 0290  1    of the guilt of our first ancestor. In the rhyming
G55 0290 11    catechism this doctrine is worded thus: "In Adam's
G55 0300  7    fall We sin-ned all".
G55 0310  1       This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense. I
G55 0310 10    did not feel it presumptuous to expect that the Creator
G55 0320  8    would be at least as just as the most righteous of
G55 0330  6    His creatures; and the doctrine of original sin is
G55 0340  3    compounded of injustice.
G55 0340  6       Some of these thoughts- not all of them- have taken
G55 0350  6    organized form in later years. The actual impelling
G55 0360  2    force which severed me from evangelical effort was
G55 0360 10    of another sort. I became disgusted at being so preoccupied
G55 0370  9    with the state of my own miserable soul. I found myself
G55 0380  8    becoming one of that group of people who, in Carlyle's
G55 0390  5    words, "are forever gazing into their own navels, anxiously
G55 0400  3    asking 'Am I right, am I wrong'"? I bethought me of
G55 0410  3    the Lord's Prayer, and these words came to mind: "Thy
G55 0420  2    kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in
G55 0420 14    heaven". They have remained on the opened page of my
G55 0430 10    mind in all the years which since have passed. From
G55 0440  6    that time to this my religious concern is that I might
G55 0450  5    give effective help to the bringing in of God's kingdom
G55 0460  1    on earth.
G55 0460  3       I do not claim to be free from sin, or from the
G55 0470  1    need for repentance and forgiveness. In my experience
G55 0470  9    the assurance of forgiveness comes only when I have
G55 0480  8    confessed to the wronged one and have made as full
G55 0490  5    reparation as I can devise.
G55 0490 10    ##
G55 0490 11    There was one further step in my religious progress.
G55 0500  7    This was taken after I came to live in Springfield,
G55 0510  5    and it was made under the guidance of the Reverend
G55 0520  1    Raymond Beardslee, a young preacher who came to the
G55 0520 10    Congregational Church there at about the same time
G55 0530  8    that I moved from New York. His father was a professor
G55 0540  6    at Hartford Theological Seminary, and from him he acquired
G55 0550  6    a conviction, which he passed along to me, that there
G55 0560  2    is in the universe of persons a moral law, the law
G55 0560 13    of love, which is a natural law in the same sense as
G55 0570 11    is the physical law.
G55 0580  1       It is most important that we recognize the law of
G55 0580 11    love as being unbreakable in all personal relationships,
G55 0590  5    whether individually, socially or as between whole
G55 0600  5    nations of people. If obeyed, the law brings order
G55 0610  1    and satisfaction. If disobeyed, the result is turmoil
G55 0610  9    and chaos.
G55 0620  1       As we observe moral law and physical law they appear
G55 0620 11    as being inevitable. We can conceive of no alternatives.
G55 0630  7    Their basis seems deeper than mere authority. They
G55 0640  5    are not true because scientists or prophets say they
G55 0650  3    are true. It is not the authority of God Himself which
G55 0660  1    makes them true. Because God is what He is, the laws
G55 0660 12    of the universe, material and spiritual, are what they
G55 0670  7    are. Deity and Law are one and inseparable.
G55 0680  3       With this conviction, the partition between the
G55 0690  2    sacred and the secular disappears. One's daily work
G55 0690 10    becomes sacred, since it is performed in the field
G55 0700  8    of influence of the moral law, dealing as it does with
G55 0710  6    people as well as with matter and energy.
G55 0720  1       In his book Civilization and Ethics Albert Schweitzer
G55 0720  9    faces the moral problems which arise when moral law
G55 0730  9    is recognized in business life, for example. His Ethics
G55 0740  6    defines "possessions as the property of the community,
G55 0750  5    of which the individual is sovereign steward. One serves
G55 0760  3    society by conducting a business from which a certain
G55 0770  1    number of employees draw their means of subsistence;
G55 0770  9    another by giving away his property in order to help
G55 0780  8    his fellow man. Each will decide on his own course
G55 0790  5    somewhere between these two extreme cases according
G55 0800  1    to the sense of responsibility which is determined
G55 0800  9    for him by the particular circumstances of his own
G55 0810  5    life. No one is to judge others".
G55 0820  1       He is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man
G55 0820 10    who finds it necessary to inflict or permit injury
G55 0830  8    to one individual or group for the sake of a larger
G55 0840  6    good. For this decision a man must take personal responsibility.
G55 0850  2    Says he, "I may never imagine that in the struggle
G55 0860  1    between personal and supra-personal responsibility
G55 0860  7    it is possible to make a compromise between the ethical
G55 0870  8    and the purposive in the shape of a relative ethic;
G55 0880  5    or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive.
G55 0890  1    On the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision
G55 0890 13    as between the two".
G55 0900  3       Schweitzer seems, in fact, to acquire for himself
G55 0910  1    a burden of sin, not bequeathed by Adam, but accumulated
G55 0910 11    in the inevitable judgments which life requires of
G55 0920  7    him as between greater and lesser responsibilities.
G55 0930  3    This viewpoint I find interesting, but it has never
G55 0940  3    weighed on my soul. Perhaps it should have. My own
G55 0940 13    experience has followed simpler lines.
G55 0950  5       An uncompromising belief in the moral law has the
G55 0960  5    advantage of making religion natural, even as physical
G55 0970  1    law is natural. Neither the engineer nor the ordinary
G55 0970 10    citizen feels any self-consciousness in obeying the
G55 0980  7    laws of matter and energy, nor can he achieve a sense
G55 0990  7    of self-righteousness in such obedience. To obey the
G55 1000  3    moral law is just ordinary common sense, applied to
G55 1000 12    a neglected field. Religion thus becomes integrated
G55 1010  6    with life.
G55 1010  8       This truth that the moral law is natural has other
G55 1020 10    important corollaries. One of them is that it gives
G55 1030  7    meaning and purpose to life. In seeking for such meaning
G55 1040  4    and purpose, Albert Schweitzer seized upon the concept
G55 1050  1    of the "sacredness of life". It is puzzling to the
G55 1050 11    occidental mind (to mine at least) to assign "sacredness"
G55 1060  9    to animal, insect, and plant life. These lives are
G55 1070  7    in themselves outside of the moral order and are unburdened
G55 1080  4    with moral responsibility. There is indeed a moral
G55 1090  2    responsibility on man himself, for his own soul's sake,
G55 1090 11    to respect lower life and to avoid the infliction of
G55 1100  9    suffering, but this viewpoint Schweitzer rejects.
G55 1110  3       So far as "sacredness" inheres in any aspect of
G55 1120  5    creation it seems to me to be found in human personality,
G55 1130  1    whether in Lambarene, Africa, or in Washington, D.C.
G55 1130  9    One cannot read the records of scientists, officials
G55 1140  8    and travelers who have penetrated to the minds of the
G55 1150  8    most savage races without realizing that each individual
G55 1160  4    met with is a person. Read, for instance, in Malcolm
G55 1170  2    MacDonald's Borneo People of Segura and her wise father
G55 1180  2    Tomonggong Koh, and her final adjustment to encroaching
G55 1180 10    civilization. Above all read in Jens Bjerre's The Last
G55 1190  9    Cannibals how the old man of the Wailbri tribe (not
G55 1200 10    cannibals) in central Australia gave to the white man
G55 1210  6    his choicest possession, while the tears streamed down
G55 1220  3    his face. The Australian aborigine is the conventional
G55 1230  1    exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth
G55 1230 10    of sensibility which is lacking in a considerable portion
G55 1240  8    of the beneficiaries of our civilization.
G55 1250  2       Persons, whether white, black, brown or yellow,
G55 1260  1    are a concern of God. Respect for personality is a
G55 1260 11    privilege and a duty for us as brothers.
G55 1270  6       Such is the field for exercising our reverence.
G55 1280  2    As to our action, let us align ourselves with the purpose
G55 1290  1    expressed by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer: "Thy kingdom
G55 1290 10    come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven".
G55 1300 12    With the knowledge that the kingdom comes by obedience
G55 1310  7    to the moral law in our relations with all people,
G55 1320  4    we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means
G55 1330  1    and the ends of our lives.
G55 1330  7       This intellectual approach to spiritual life suited
G55 1340  3    me well, because I was never content to lead a divided
G55 1350  1    life. As I have said, words from Tennyson remain ever
G55 1350 11    in my memory: "That mind and soul, according well,
G55 1360  7    May make one music as before".
G55 1370  2       Let us now give some thought to the soul. When the
G55 1380  1    young biologist, Dr. Ballard, began to show interest
G55 1380  9    in our daughter Elizabeth, this induced a corresponding
G55 1390  6    interest, on our part, in him. I asked one day what
G55 1400  7    he was doing. He told me that he had a big newt and
G55 1410  3    a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye
G55 1410 14    of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye
G55 1420 11    of the little newt onto the big newt. He was then noting
G55 1430  8    that the big eye on the little newt hung back until
G55 1440  4    the little eye had grown up to it, while the little
G55 1450  1    eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big
G55 1450 13    as the other. Then I asked, "What does that teach you"?
G55 1460  8    Said he, "It teaches me to wonder".
G55 1470  4       This was a profound statement. In the face of the
G55 1480  3    unfolding universe, our ultimate attitude is that of
G55 1480 11    wonder. Wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to
G55 1490  8    the spiritual world.
G55 1500  1       Gone are the days when, in the nineteenth century,
G55 1500 10    scientists thought that they were close to the attainment
G55 1510  8    of complete knowledge of the physical universe. For
G55 1520  5    them only a little more needed to be learned, and then
G55 1530  3    all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted, packaged
G55 1540  1    and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution
G55 1540 13    of any human problem.
G55 1550  2       This complacency was blown to bits by the relativity
G55 1560  1    of Einstein, the revelation of the complex anatomy
G55 1560  9    of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe.
G55 1570  6    None of these discoveries were neatly rounded off bits
G55 1580  5    of knowledge. Each faded out into the unexplored areas
G55 1590  2    of the future.
G55 1590  5       It is as if we, in our center of human observation,
G55 1600  2    from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown.
G55 1610  1    As our radius of penetration, R, increases, the area
G55 1610 10    of new knowledge increases by **f, and the total of
G55 1630  8    human knowledge becomes measured in terms of **f. Wonder
G55 1640  6    grows. It is endless.
G55 1640 10       There are some people, intelligent people, who seem
G55 1650  7    to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we are
G55 1660  7    immersed and in which we spend our lives. One such
G55 1670  2    is Abraham Meyer, the writer of a recent book, Speaking
G55 1670 12    of Man. This is a straightforward denial of the spiritual
G55 1680 10    world and a vigorous defense of pure materialism. His
G55 1690  8    inability to wonder vitiates his argument.
G55 1700  3       The subject of immortality brings to mind a vivid
G55 1710  2    incident which took place in 1929 at Montreux in Switzerland.
