A18 0010  1       "A Night in New Orleans" is the gayety planned by
A18 0010 11    members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont
A18 0020 11    Country Club. The women have a reputation for giving
A18 0030  8    parties that are different and are fun and this year's
A18 0040  7    promises to follow in this fine tradition. Mrs. H.
A18 0050  3    J. Grinsfelder is chairman.
A18 0050  7       The Louisiana city is known, of course, for its
A18 0060  8    fine food, good music and its colorful hospitality
A18 0065  2    "and, when guests arrive at Philmont that night", says
A18 0080  2    Mrs. Grinsfelder, "that is exactly what we expect to
A18 0080 11    offer them. We've been working for weeks. The prospects
A18 0090  9    look great. We are keeping a number of surprises under
A18 0100  9    our hats. But we can't tell it all now and then have
A18 0110  8    no new excitement later".
A18 0110 12    #BASIN STREET BEAT#
A18 0120  2    But she does indicate festivities will start early,
A18 0120 10    that a jazz combo will "give with the Basin Street
A18 0130 10    beat" during the cocktail and dinner hours and that
A18 0140  7    Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the
A18 0150  4    dancing.
A18 0150  5       As for food, Mrs. Henry Louchheim, chairman of this
A18 0155  4    phase, is a globetrotter who knows good food. "New
A18 0170  1    Orleans"? she says, "of course I've had the best. It
A18 0180  1    is just bad luck that we are having the party in a
A18 0180 13    month with no R's, so no oysters. But we have lots
A18 0190  8    of other New Orleans specialties. I know they will
A18 0200  5    be good. We've tried them out on the club chef- or
A18 0210  4    say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected
A18 0210 16    the best".
A18 0220  1    #SCENIC EFFECTS#
A18 0220  3    Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic effects.
A18 0230  2    There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the
A18 0240  1    handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other
A18 0240  9    things that are typical of New Orleans. Mrs. Harry
A18 0250  7    K. Cohen is chairman of this phase and she is getting
A18 0260  6    an artistic assist from A. Van Hollander, display director
A18 0270  3    of Gimbel Brothers.
A18 0270  6       The gala is the Thrift Shop's annual bundle party
A18 0280  5    and, as all Thrift Shop friends know, that means the
A18 0290  5    admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition,
A18 0300  1    contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and
A18 0300  9    such to stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters
A18 0310  8    at 1213 Walnut St.
A18 0320  1    #BUNDLE CENTERS#
A18 0320  3    For the convenience of guests bundle centers have been
A18 0330  3    established throughout the city and suburbs where the
A18 0330 11    donations may be deposited between now and the date
A18 0340  9    of the big event. In addition to the bundles, guests
A18 0350  5    pay the cost of their dinners. Members of the young
A18 0360  4    set who would like to come to the party only during
A18 0360 15    the dancing time are welcomed.
A18 0370  4       The Thrift Shop, with Mrs. Bernhard S. Blumenthal
A18 0380  3    as president, is one of the city's most successful
A18 0390  1    fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies.
A18 0390  9    Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated
A18 0400  9    in the contribution made by them during the past 25
A18 0410  7    years that totals $840,000.
A18 0410 11    #IT'S BIG BUSINESS#
A18 0420  2    "Big business, this little Thrift Shop business", say
A18 0430  2    the members. For most of the 25 years the operation
A18 0430 12    was under feminine direction. In the past few years
A18 0440  7    the men, mostly husbands of members, have taken an
A18 0450  4    interest. Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's committee
A18 0460  2    that, among other jobs, takes over part of the responsibility
A18 0470  1    for staffing the shop during its evening hours.

A18 0820 11       The Troop is proud of its camping-out program- on
A18 0830  7    year-round schedule and was continued even when sub-zero
A18 0840  5    temperatures were registered during the past winter.
