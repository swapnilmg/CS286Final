P17 0010  1    ##
P17 0010  2    When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car, the Jaguar his
P17 0010 12    wife Linda had given him for his last birthday, and
P17 0020  9    himself quite thoroughly with it, driving back from
P17 0030  6    an afternoon's golf at Oakmont, it seemed to mark the
P17 0040  4    end of a long, miswritten chapter in the social life
P17 0040 14    of the community. Linda looked remote yet lovely in
P17 0050  9    black, and everyone held his or her breath.
P17 0060  6       Not that Linda was heartless, not that she would
P17 0070  3    do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than
P17 0070 13    John Cooper would. Hadn't Linda been a perfect wife
P17 0080  9    to Bobbie, who was the least bit of a disappointment
P17 0090  8    all these years?
P17 0090 11       Wasn't John Cooper even more attractive at forty-seven
P17 0100  9    than he had been twenty-five years earlier? And wasn't
P17 0110  7    John's wife, Edythe, even more appalling, if possible?
P17 0120  6    Didn't John Cooper, after all this time, deserve something
P17 0130  5    better of life? Wasn't it adult and realistic to look
P17 0140  4    at it that way? And romantic?
P17 0140 10       Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe
P17 0150  8    on the rebound. It was the kind of thing that could
P17 0160  7    ruin a man's life, and it was a tribute to John's strength
P17 0170  4    of character and very real business ability that it
P17 0180  2    hadn't ruined his. "Of course, there was nothing you
P17 0180 11    could do, but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself
P17 0190 11    for letting it happen", Mousie Chandler said to Linda
P17 0200  6    Stuart. "Poor John"! Linda accepted the reproach, which
P17 0210  5    was something she did rarely in all her life and most
P17 0220  5    rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds
P17 0230  1    the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the
P17 0230 10    Allegheny Mountains, and John was surely one of the
P17 0240  8    handsomer and brighter young men around Pittsburgh.
P17 0250  4       For it had been John and Linda ever since she had
P17 0260  4    come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the
P17 0260 15    goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but
P17 0270  9    even of her fellow debs. John had claimed her from
P17 0280  7    the stag line, a young man a year out of Dartmouth
P17 0290  3    with skiing crinkles still around his eyes.
P17 0290 10       You saw them always together those years. You talked
P17 0300  9    about John-and-Linda as an entity. John-and-Linda were
P17 0310  8    at Longue Vue last night; John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut
P17 0320  7    in three and a half hours. Then there was a spat over
P17 0330  5    something, as there had been lovers' spats before;
P17 0340  1    only this one didn't heal.
P17 0340  6       You still said "John-and-Linda", but as if you were
P17 0350  6    speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression
P17 0360  4    or Dillinger. It got worse instead of better. First,
P17 0370  1    it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled- he
P17 0370 11    had died the year before- that John and his mother
P17 0380  9    weren't rich any more. And then there was Linda's engagement
P17 0390  7    to Bobbie Evans.
P17 0400  1       There was no connection between the two events,
P17 0400  9    because Bobbie wasn't rich, either, though he was more
P17 0410  7    aggressive than John. He was a bright and handsome
P17 0420  5    young man from New York, who worked for the same steel
P17 0430  2    company as John did.
P17 0430  6       Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement
P17 0440  4    to jolt John into some action, but when John came home
P17 0450  3    from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe, with
P17 0450 12    Edythe his bride, it could no longer be John-and-Linda
P17 0460 11    even to sentimental wishful thinkers. It wasn't even
P17 0470  6    John and Edythe. It was simply Poor John.
P17 0480  3       There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe,
P17 0490  1    but there was absolutely nothing right about her either.
P17 0490 10    Mousie Chandler had been to school with her someplace
P17 0500  9    near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend
P17 0510  7    her to the gang having lunch at Horne's.
P17 0520  1       "Well, you shouldn't underestimate Edythe", Mousie
P17 0530  2    said. "I know she gives the impression of being shallow
P17 0530 12    and frivolous and scatterbrained. She is frivolous
P17 0540  7    and scatterbrained, but she really isn't shallow"...
P17 0550  5       Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding.
P17 0560  5    John was at the church with Edythe. She giggled during
P17 0570  3    the ceremony, and Mousie Chandler, who was one of Linda's
P17 0580  2    bridesmaids, said John glared black as death at her.
P17 0580 11    "As if he were choking", she said. "Poor John"!
P17 0590  9       Edythe settled down to become a social myth and
P17 0600  9    a horrible example. Her hair never seemed to be in
P17 0610  6    place and her skirts were never quite the correct length.
P17 0620  2    She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at
P17 0620 13    the pool at Longue Vue, but her bathing suits were
P17 0630 10    far from smart. And you didn't see her much at Longue
P17 0640  8    Vue or anywhere, for John had drifted away from the
P17 0650  4    gang. Mousie said it was because he was too proud to
P17 0660  2    stand pity. Others thought he couldn't stand seeing
P17 0660 10    Linda, Mrs. Bobbie Evans, still so beautiful, so much
P17 0670  8    in command of everything.
P17 0680  1       There were less-dramatic reasons too. John's mother
P17 0690  1    died not long after his marriage, and there was even
P17 0690 11    less Cooper money left. John sold the big old place
P17 0700  8    in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel.
P17 0710  5    He was not reduced to poverty, but his job at the steel
P17 0720  4    company had become a real job and not a method of passing
P17 0730  1    the day.
P17 0730  3       John was good at his job. It probably wasn't hard
P17 0740  1    for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing
P17 0740 12    but Edythe to come home to. Though that may be unfair
P17 0750 10    since Ben Cooper, John's first son, came along early
P17 0760  6    in 1938, the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing
P17 0770  4    that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes,
P17 0780  1    nary a trace of Edythe.
P17 0780  6       But the continuing charm of the other children-
P17 0790  1    Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944- and all John's success
P17 0800  1    at his work only made Edythe's dizziness and general
P17 0800 10    uselessness more glaring. She never could fit into
P17 0810  8    a crowd which had known, which still knew and admired
P17 0820  5    Linda.
P17 0820  6       When there was bridge at Edythe's house, the cards
P17 0830  4    shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably
P17 0840  2    was wet graham crackers. She managed a missionary drive
P17 0850  1    for the church once and got the books so confused that
P17 0850 12    old Mr. Webber, the eldest elder, who'd never donated
P17 0860  8    more than five dollars to anything, had to cough up
P17 0870  7    five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe
P17 0880  4    called "the bosoms of the church". John did find the
P17 0890  2    missing checks and money afterward, and the drive was
P17 0890 11    actually oversubscribed, which was a real bit of luck
P17 0900  8    for the missionaries.
P17 0900 11    ##
P17 0910  1    Being an intelligent man, John must have guessed what
P17 0910 10    everyone thought about Edythe, but he never let on
P17 0920  8    by so much as a brave smile. Poor John was the kind
P17 0930  5    of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and
P17 0940  2    maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one. He was
P17 0940 13    an attentive and generous husband, overgenerous, a
P17 0950  6    lot of people felt, because they knew that money must
P17 0960  5    be a problem to him. But he got ahead in business:
P17 0970  1    on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment
P17 0980  1    during the war; after the war back to the heir apparency
P17 0980 12    of the steel company.
P17 0990  2       The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially, but no
P17 1000  2    more than was necessary. Bobbie had been successful,
P17 1000 10    too, though he didn't match John's pace, and after
P17 1010  7    all he didn't need to, with all the Stuart money. He
P17 1020  6    and Linda settled down to being social leaders, and
P17 1030  3    Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each
P17 1030 12    year.
P17 1040  1       And then came the hairpin turn, the smashed Jaguar
P17 1040 10    and Linda, mourning alone and lovely.
P17 1050  5       Everyone held his or her breath.
P17 1060  1       "Don't think Linda couldn't have got John back any
P17 1060 10    time, if she'd tried", Mousie Gordon, who had been
P17 1070  9    Mousie Chandler, said between bites of a chicken sandwich
P17 1080  8    at a luncheon table at Le Mont. "Now you know she could've,
P17 1090  7    but she isn't that kind of girl. But now- well, it
P17 1100  6    would be a blessing, I think. Poor John".
P17 1110  1       Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever
P17 1110 10    dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling. What
P17 1120  9    she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste
P17 1130  7    to it, not so much sorrow for handsome, ambitious Bobbie,
P17 1140  3    but for the lost years that had been brought into high
P17 1150  2    relief by his death.
P17 1150  6       She knew what people were thinking; it was what
P17 1160  4    she had been thinking herself. It was up to her to
P17 1160 15    save Poor John, dear John, to undo the wrong she had
P17 1170 11    done, but she trembled at the decision as at the brink
P17 1180  8    of a cold stream.
P17 1180 12       There was no one who would blame her or John; she
P17 1190 11    could be sure of that. It might be rough on Edythe
P17 1200  7    at first, but Linda and John between them could make
P17 1210  4    a settlement handsome enough to soothe her, to send
P17 1210 13    her back to Cleveland or anywhere. And Linda felt capable
P17 1220 10    of capturing the affection of the children, anxious
P17 1230  7    even, since she and Bobbie had had none of their own.
P17 1240  7    It would be good for them to have a mother they need
P17 1250  3    not be ashamed of.
P17 1250  7       Linda would have to wait, she knew. But what was
P17 1260  4    a decent six months or so after the more than twenty
P17 1270  1    years gone by? Years of watching while Poor John struggled
P17 1270 11    without the help and understanding of the kind of wife
P17 1280 10    a man needed to get ahead. Of course, he had done wonders
P17 1290  8    ...
P17 1290  9    ##
P17 1290 10    Alloy steels and regular steels had different sales
P17 1300  6    departments at Smith + MacIsaacs, where John and Bobbie
P17 1310  5    both worked. Bobbie had been head of the alloy division,
P17 1320  3    while John was just another good salesman in the regular
P17 1330  1    branch. So when old Mr. Lovejoy, the company president,
P17 1330 10    talked about putting in a single sales manager for
P17 1340  9    both branches after the head of the regular steels
P17 1350  6    had gone with Carnegie-Illinois, it looked like the
P17 1360  3    perfect chance for Bobbie. For Linda knew how to help
P17 1360 13    her husband, not just the Stuart-family contacts but
P17 1370  9    also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy.
P17 1380  4       She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the
P17 1390  5    news that Poor John had won the job. "What did you
P17 1400  2    do"? she asked Bobbie. "You must have done something,
P17 1400 11    something wrong. Lord knows I had everything set for
P17 1410  9    you".
P17 1410 10       Bobbie said something about damned Pittsburghers
P17 1420  6    sticking together, and Linda got angry at him. They
P17 1430  7    had their first real fight, and Bobbie went off to
P17 1440  4    get drunk.
P17 1440  6       Linda dragooned her uncle, Donald Murkland, into
P17 1450  2    a lunch the next day to find out what had happened.
P17 1450 13    He was a director of S. + M. and must have been in
P17 1460 13    on the decision. But jolly old Uncle Donald would tell
P17 1470  8    her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered
P17 1480  5    for the job, but there were factors in a large company
P17 1490  4    which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand.
P17 1500  1       He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where
P17 1510  1    Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other.
P17 1510 10       "I'm behind John Cooper", Mr. Lovejoy said finally.
P17 1520  8    "I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in
P17 1530  9    ability, so we have to look at the thing in terms of
P17 1540  7    incentive.
P17 1540  8       "Now, I believe Poor John'll work just a little
P17 1550  6    harder. With that wife of his, I think he feels every
P17 1560  4    chance he gets is his big chance. Bobbie, with Linda
P17 1570  1    behind him, will have plenty of other opportunities.
P17 1570  9    And also, the money can't mean as much to Bobbie.
P17 1580  8       "Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and
P17 1590  7    work hard at it; Poor John will take it as a miracle
P17 1600  5    and have every other independent steel company sitting
P17 1610  1    up nights worrying about us".
P17 1610  6       Most of the directors nodded. Uncle Donald Murkland
P17 1620  4    found himself nodding agreement too.
P17 1630  1       After the surprise was over, Linda was almost as
P17 1630  9    pleased as anyone with John's good luck, though she
P17 1640  7    agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to
P17 1650  5    move to Funk Furnaces. The job at Funk wasn't particularly
P17 1660  2    better, but it got him away from being subordinate
P17 1660 11    to John and assured him steady advancement, since Funk
P17 1670  9    was owned to a large degree by various branches of
P17 1680  7    Linda's family.
P17 1680  9       Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric. When
P17 1690  7    he was made a vice president only a year after the
P17 1700  6    new sales job, a leading business magazine ran his
P17 1710  2    photograph with a brief biography in a series on NATIONAL
P17 1710 12    BUSINESS LEADERS OF THE FUTURE.
