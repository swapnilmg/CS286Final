M03 0010  1    This was not, for the Angel, just a matter of running
M03 0010 12    through a logical or deductive chain, or deciding on
M03 0020  7    some action from some already established premise.
M03 0030  3    No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as
M03 0040  2    fast as any computer.
M03 0040  6       What Gabriel was being asked to do now, however,
M03 0050  3    was to re-examine all his basic assumptions, make value-judgments
M03 0060  1    on them, and give them new and different powers in
M03 0060 11    his mind to govern his motives. This is not wholly
M03 0070  9    a reasoning process- a computer cannot do it all- and
M03 0080  6    even in an Angel it takes time. (Or, perhaps, especially
M03 0090  3    in an Angel, whose assumptions had mostly been fixed
M03 0100  2    millions of years ago.)
M03 0100  6       Being reasonably sure of the reason for the long
M03 0110  5    pause, however, did not make it seem any less long
M03 0120  1    to Jack. He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping
M03 0120 11    back answers to questions almost before Jack could
M03 0130  7    get them asked.
M03 0140  1       There was nothing he could do but wait. The dice
M03 0140 10    were cast.
M03 0140 12       At last Gabriel spoke.
M03 0150  4       "We misjudged you", he said slowly. "We had concluded
M03 0160  4    that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time
M03 0170  2    to develop a sense of justice. Of course we have before
M03 0170 13    us the example of the great races at the galactic center;
M03 0180 10    individually they are nearly as mortal as you- the
M03 0190  8    difference does not seem very marked to us, where it
M03 0200  5    exists. But they have survived for long periods as
M03 0210  1    races, whereas you are young. We shall recommend to
M03 0210 10    them that they shorten your trial period by half.
M03 0220  8       "For now, it is clear that we were in the wrong.
M03 0230  7    You may reclaim your property, and the penalty on Hesperus
M03 0240  4    is lifted. Hesperus, you may speak".
M03 0250  1       "I did not perceive this essential distinction either,
M03 0250  8    First-Born", Hesperus said at once, "I was only practicing
M03 0260  9    a concept that Jack taught me, called a deal".
M03 0270  6       "Nevertheless, you were its agent. Jack, what is
M03 0280  5    the nature of this concept"?
M03 0280 10       "It's a kind of agreement in which each party gives
M03 0290 10    something to the other", Jack said. "We regard it as
M03 0300  7    fair only when each party feels that what he has received
M03 0310  6    is as valuable, or more valuable, than what he has
M03 0320  3    given". His heart, he discovered, was pounding. "For
M03 0330  1    instance, Hesperus agreed to help me find my property,
M03 0330 10    and I agreed to take him to Earth. Between individuals,
M03 0340  8    this process is called bargaining. When it is done
M03 0350  6    between races or nations, it is called making a treaty.
M03 0360  4    And the major part of my mission to your nest is to
M03 0370  1    make a treaty between your race and mine. Recovering
M03 0370 10    the property was much less important".
M03 0380  4       "Strange", Gabriel said. "And apparently impossible.
M03 0390  3    Though it might be that we would have much to give
M03 0400  2    you, you have nothing to give us".
M03 0400  9       "Hesperus and Lucifer", Jack said, "show that we
M03 0410  6    do".
M03 0410  7       Another pause; but this one was not nearly as long.
M03 0420  9       "Then it is a matter of pleasure; of curiosity;
M03 0430  4    of a more alive time. Yes, those could be commodities
M03 0440  3    under this concept. But you should understand, Jack,
M03 0450  1    that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery.
M03 0450 12    Visiting the Earth would not be an offering of worth
M03 0460 10    to those of us who are older".
M03 0470  1       This explained a great deal. "All the more reason,
M03 0480  1    then", Jack said, "why we must have a treaty. We will
M03 0480 12    gladly entertain your young and give them proper living
M03 0490  8    quarters, in return for their help in running our fusion
M03 0500  7    reactors. But we must know if this is in accordance
M03 0510  4    with your customs, and must have your agreement they
M03 0520  1    will not misuse the power we put in their hands, to
M03 0520 12    our hurt".
M03 0530  1       "But this simply requires that they behave in accordance
M03 0530 10    with the dictates of their own natures, and respect
M03 0540  8    yours in turn. To this we of course agree".
M03 0560  4       Jack felt a wave of complete elation, but in a second
M03 0570  4    it had vanished without a trace. What Gabriel was asking
M03 0580  1    was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments,
M03 0580 10    and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it
M03 0590 10    is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws.
M03 0600  6    The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints
M03 0610  3    in respect for the natural preferences and natures
M03 0620  1    of the Earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of
M03 0620 11    man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws
M03 0630  7    which were contrary to his own preferences and violations
M03 0640  4    of his nature.
M03 0640  7       The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking
M03 0650  5    him to ratify, in short, was nothing less than total
M03 0660  4    trust.
M03 0660  5       Nothing less would serve. And it might be, considering
M03 0670  3    the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking
M03 0680  1    of everything in terms of absolutes, that the proposal
M03 0680 10    of anything less might well amount instead to something
M03 0690  7    like a declaration of war.
M03 0700  1       Furthermore, even the highly trained law clerk who
M03 0700  9    was a part of Jack's total make-up could not understand
M03 0710  8    how the principle could ever be codified. Almost the
M03 0720  6    whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion,
M03 0730  2    not trust, as the safest and sanest attitude toward
M03 0730 11    all outsiders.
M03 0740  2       Yet there was some precedent for it. The history
M03 0740 11    of disarmament agreements, for instance, had been unreassuringly
M03 0750  8    dismal; but the United States and the Union of Soviet
M03 0760 10    Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree
M03 0770  5    on an atomic bomb test ban, and a sort of provisional
M03 0780  5    acceptance of each other's good intentions on this
M03 0790  2    limited question. Out of that agreement, though not
M03 0790 10    by any easy road, eventually emerged the present world
M03 0800  7    hegemony of the United Nations; suspicion between member
M03 0810  4    states still existed, but it was of about the same
M03 0820  4    low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry
M03 0830  1    between Arizona and California over water supplies.
M03 0830  8       Besides, agreements "in principle", with the petty
M03 0840  7    details to be thrashed out later, were commonplace
M03 0850  5    in diplomatic history. The trouble with them was that
M03 0860  4    they almost never worked, and in fact an agreement
M03 0860 13    "in principle" historically turned out to be a sure
M03 0870  9    sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled.
M03 0880  7       Suppose that this one were to work? There was no
M03 0890  7    question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side,
M03 0900  5    at least. If mankind could be convinced of that ...
M03 0910  1       It was worth trying. In fact, it had to be tried.
M03 0910 12    It would be at once the most tentative and most final
M03 0920 10    treaty that Earth had ever signed. Secretary Hart had
M03 0930  6    taught Jack, at least partially, to be content with
M03 0940  4    small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there
M03 0950  1    was no small way to handle this one.
M03 0950  9       He turned back to the screens, the crucial, conclusive
M03 0960  5    phrase on his lips. But he was too late. He had lost
M03 0970  4    his audience.
M03 0970  6    ##
M03 0970  7    For a moment he could make no sense at all of what
M03 0980  6    he saw. It seemed to be only a riot of color, light
M03 0990  1    and meaningless activity. Gradually, he realized that
M03 0990  8    the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished, and that
M03 1000  8    the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken
M03 1010  6    up. The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly
M03 1020  2    in all directions, seemingly at random.
M03 1020  8       "Hesperus! What's going on here? What's happened"?
M03 1030  7       "Your brothers have been found. They are on their
M03 1040  9    way here".
M03 1050  1       "Where? I don't see them. The instruments don't
M03 1050  8    show them".
M03 1060  1       "You can't see them yet, Jack. They'll be in range
M03 1070  1    in a short while".
M03 1070  5       Jack scanned the skies, the boards, and the skies
M03 1080  3    again. Nothing. No- there was a tiny pip on the radar;
M03 1090  1    and it was getting bigger rapidly. If that was the
M03 1090 11    skiff, it was making unprecedented speed.
M03 1100  3       Then the skiff hove into sight, just a dot of light
M03 1110  5    at first against the roiling blackness and crimson
M03 1110 13    streaks of the Coal Sack. Through the telescope, Jack
M03 1120  9    could see that both spacesuits were still attached
M03 1130  6    to it. The sail was still unfurled, though there were
M03 1140  4    a good many holes in it, as Langer had predicted would
M03 1150  2    be the case by now.
M03 1150  7       It was a startling, almost numenous sight; but even
M03 1160  4    more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous
M03 1170  2    comet's-tail of Angels.
M03 1170  6       The skiff was not heading for the nursery, however.
M03 1180  5    It seemed unlikely that her crew, if either of them
M03 1190  3    were alive, could even see the Ariadne, for they were
M03 1190 13    passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year. And
M03 1200 11    there would be no chance of signaling them- without
M03 1210  6    the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful
M03 1220  6    enough to get through all the static, and by the time
M03 1230  3    he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be
M03 1230 13    gone.
M03 1240  1       Fuming, helpless, he watched them pass him. The
M03 1240  9    sail, ragged though it was, still had enough surface
M03 1250  8    to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out
M03 1260  5    from the nursery stars. He would never have believed,
M03 1270  1    without seeing it, that the bizarre little vessel could
M03 1270 10    go so fast.
M03 1280  2       But where was it going? And why was it causing so
M03 1280 13    much agitation among the Angels, and being followed
M03 1290  8    by so many of them?
M03 1300  1       There was only one possible answer, but Jack's horrified
M03 1310  1    mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar
M03 1310 12    plots of the skiff's course into the computer. The
M03 1320  6    curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't
M03 1330  6    be argued with, however.
M03 1330 10       The skiff was headed for the very center of the
M03 1340  9    nebula- toward that place which, Jack knew now, could
M03 1350  5    hold nothing less important than the very core of the
M03 1360  3    Angel's life and religion.
M03 1360  7       It was clear that Langer had at last found a way
M03 1370  7    to attract the Angel's attention.
M03 1375  1       It was equally clear that as of this moment, the
M03 1375 11    treaty was off.
M03 1380  1    #STERN CHASE 10#
M03 1380  4    LANGER WOULD HAVE to be headed off, whether he knew
M03 1390  3    where he was going or not. Almost surely he did; after
M03 1390 14    all, he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had
M03 1400 13    to work from, and he was an almost frighteningly observant
M03 1410  7    man. But not having talked to the Angels, he had made
M03 1420  7    a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line.
M03 1430  3    Had he decided, perhaps, that the center of the cloud
M03 1435  1    was a center of government, instead of a center of
M03 1440 10    life and faith"?
M03 1450  1       But it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade
M03 1450 11    the Holy of Holies, or was simply headed in that direction
M03 1460 10    by accident. If it was intentional, it was now also
M03 1470  8    unnecessary; and whether intentional or not, the outcome
M03 1480  5    would be disastrous.
M03 1480  8       Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six
M03 1490  7    feet of lead line he had excised from the Nernst generator
M03 1500  4    switch. When he was back on his feet again and about
M03 1510  3    to reinstall the fuses, however, he hesitated.
M03 1510 10       He had to have fusion power to catch up with the
M03 1520 10    skiff, and he had to have it fast. But fusion power
M03 1530  6    in the Coal Sack was what had triggered all the trouble
M03 1540  4    in the first place- and he already had an Angel aboard.
M03 1550  1       "Hesperus"?
M03 1550  2       "Receiving".
M03 1550  3       "I'm going to turn my generator back on, as I promised
M03 1560 11    to do. But I can't take you to Earth yet. First I've
M03 1570  8    got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper
M03 1580  6    into trouble. Will you obstruct this, or will you help?
M03 1590  5    I know it's not part of the bargain, and your elders
M03 1600  2    might not like it".
M03 1600  6       "Nobody else can live in your hearth while I am
M03 1610  5    in it", Hesperus said promptly. "As for my elders,
M03 1620  1    they have already admitted that they were wrong. If
M03 1620 10    because of this incident they become angry with Earth,
M03 1630  8    I will not be permitted to go there at all. Therefore
M03 1640  7    of course I will help".
M03 1640 12       With a short-lived sigh of relief, Jack plugged
M03 1650  9    the fuses back in and threw the switch. Without an
M03 1660  5    instant's transition, the green light that meant full
M03 1670  3    fusion power winked on the board. Always before, it
M03 1670 12    had taken five minutes to-
M03 1680  5       Of course. Hesperus was in there. From here on out,
M03 1690  4    the Ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser
M03 1700  2    man had ever dreamed of.
M03 1700  7       But since he had failed to anticipate it, he lost
M03 1710  5    the five minutes anyhow, in plotting an intercept orbit.
M03 1720  2       "Hesperus, don't use this t-tau vector trick of
M03 1730  3    yours, please.
