E13 0010  1       BUILT UPON seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is
E13 0010  9    one of the most ancient cities in the world, filled
E13 0020  9    with splendor and contrast. It is an exotic place,
E13 0030  6    so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist
E13 0040  2    is likely to see at first only the contrast and the
E13 0040 13    ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses.
E13 0050  8    At the moment, many of these are being pulled down.
E13 0060  7    Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled
E13 0070  3    to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will
E13 0080  1    show off its treasures to better advantage- the great
E13 0080 10    domes and graceful spires of its mosques, the panorama
E13 0090  7    of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. Even when they
E13 0100  5    are finished, however, the contrast will remain, for
E13 0110  3    Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built
E13 0110 14    upon two continents. For almost 3,000 years Europe
E13 0120  8    and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets.
E13 0130  5       Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called
E13 0140  4    Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of the
E13 0150  2    Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after
E13 0150 10    himself. About a thousand years after that, when the
E13 0160  8    Roman Empire was divided, it became capital of the
E13 0170  6    Eastern section. On May 11, 330 A.D., its name was
E13 0180  4    changed again, this time to Constantinople after its
E13 0190  1    emperor, Constantine. In 1453 when the last vestige
E13 0190  9    of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks, the city
E13 0200  8    officially shifted religions- although the Patriarch,
E13 0210  4    or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued to live there,
E13 0220  4    and still does- and became the capital of the Ottoman
E13 0230  1    Empire. When that was broken up after the First World
E13 0230 11    War, its name was changed once more. Rich in Christian
E13 0240 10    and Moslem art, Istanbul is today a fascinating museum
E13 0250  7    of East and West that recently became a seaside resort
E13 0270  5    as well with the development of new beaches on the
E13 0280  2    Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance
E13 0280 12    from the center of town. Easy to get to, and becoming
E13 0290 10    more popular every year, it is only fourteen hours
E13 0300  6    from New York by Pan American World Airways jet, four
E13 0310  4    hours from Rome.
E13 0310  7    #START OF TOUR#
E13 0310 10    Most of the sights lie in the old section across the
E13 0320  9    Golden Horn from the modern hotels. I started my tour
E13 0330  6    of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office, next
E13 0340  3    to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the
E13 0350  2    driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel. From there
E13 0350 11    I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels
E13 0360  8    and a park on the left, Republic Gardens, and came
E13 0370  5    in a few moments to Taksim Square, one of the hubs
E13 0380  4    of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected
E13 0390  1    in 1928, in its center.
E13 0390  6       Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop
E13 0400  5    sign for T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus, with
E13 0410  2    the sports center on my left just before I reached
E13 0410 12    the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately
E13 0420  7    after that. There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus,
E13 0430  8    past ocean liners at anchor, to Galata Bridge over
E13 0440  5    the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep of water
E13 0450  3    that empties into the Bosphorus. Across the bridge
E13 0450 11    on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown
E13 0460 11    minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires
E13 0470  7    of the Blue Mosque.
E13 0470 11       On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through
E13 0480 11    Eminonu Square, with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque,
E13 0490  8    which dates from the Seventeenth Century, just across
E13 0500  4    from the entrance to the bridge. Passing it, the bus
E13 0510  3    climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the
E13 0510 13    right and Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant,
E13 0520  7    above it. At the top of the hill the buildings on the
E13 0530  9    left gave way to a park. I got off there, crossed the
E13 0540  5    street, walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left, the
E13 0550  3    Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the
E13 0550 15    entrance of St. Sophia.
E13 0560  4       Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous
E13 0570  3    St. Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine,
E13 0580  1    this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532
E13 0580 10    and completed twenty years later. On his first trip
E13 0590  8    to the finished structure he boasted that he had built
E13 0600  7    a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem. A few
E13 0610  3    years later the dome fell in. Nevertheless, it remained
E13 0620  1    one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire,
E13 0620 11    where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned. After the
E13 0630  8    Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it
E13 0640  7    to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets. In the second
E13 0650  4    half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect
E13 0660  1    who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive
E13 0660 11    buttresses that now help support the dome. With the
E13 0670  9    birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World
E13 0680  6    War, St. Sophia became a museum, and the ancient mosaics,
E13 0690  5    which were plastered over by the Moslems, whose religion
E13 0700  3    forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.
E13 0710  1       Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which
E13 0710 12    shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary
E13 0720  9    and Justinian offering the temple. On the columns around
E13 0730  7    the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing.
E13 0740  4    The eight green columns, I learned, came from the Temple
E13 0750  4    of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple
E13 0760  1    of the Sun at Heliopolis.
E13 0760  6       Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine
E13 0770  5    Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected now
E13 0780  2    by a wooden fence. Behind this is a minber or Moslem
E13 0780 13    pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork,
E13 0790 10    where the emperors and, after them, the sultans, sat.
E13 0800  7    Directly opposite is the emperor's door, through which
E13 0810  4    they entered the building.
E13 0810  8       Outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden
E13 0820  9    in front of it, with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left.
E13 0830  8    Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome,
E13 0840  4    now a park. It was laid out in 196 for chariot races
E13 0850  2    and other public games. Statues and other monuments
E13 0850 10    that stood there were stolen, mostly by the waves of
E13 0860  9    Crusaders.
E13 0860 10       At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's
E13 0870 10    Fountain, an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome,
E13 0880  8    built in 1895 by the German Emperor, and on my left,
E13 0890  6    directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan Ahmet,
E13 0900  2    who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known
E13 0900 10    by his name.
E13 0910  3       Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed
E13 0920  1    the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead
E13 0920  9    to the Obelisk of Theodosius, originally erected in
E13 0930  6    Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose, who
E13 0940  5    also built those now in New York, London and Rome at
E13 0950  5    the Lateran. This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on
E13 0960  2    a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues
E13 0960 12    of the emperor and his family watching games in the
E13 0970 10    Hippodrome, done so realistically that the obelisk
E13 0980  5    itself is included in them.
E13 0980 10       Beyond it I noted a small green column, about twelve
E13 0990 10    feet below the present ground level- the Serpentine
E13 1000  5    Column, three entwined serpents, which once stood at
E13 1010  5    the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece. Near the end
E13 1020  3    of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated
E13 1030  1    obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that
E13 1030 11    once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes.
E13 1040  5    #MAGNIFICENT MOSQUE#
E13 1040  7    Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only
E13 1050  8    one with six minarets, I entered the courtyard, with
E13 1060  4    a gallery supported by pointed arches running around
E13 1070  2    it and a fountain in the middle. One of the most beautiful
E13 1080  1    buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early
E13 1080 10    years of the Seventeenth Century, with a huge central
E13 1090  6    dome, two half domes that seem to cascade down from
E13 1100  5    it, and smaller full domes around the gallery. The
E13 1110  2    round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular
E13 1110 10    bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin
E13 1120  8    can chant his call to prayer. Inside, the walls are
E13 1130  5    covered with blue and white tile, the floor with red
E13 1140  3    and cream carpets.
E13 1140  6       Back at the Kaiser's Fountain, I walked left to
E13 1150  5    the streetcar stop and rode up the hill- any car will
E13 1160  3    do- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the
E13 1160 13    Burnt Column, at the top on my right. It stands in
E13 1170 11    the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine,
E13 1180  7    who brought it from Rome.
E13 1190  1       I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning
E13 1190 12    right, it entered a huge square, Bayezit, with the
E13 1200  7    Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university
E13 1210  6    just beyond it. There I got off, crossed the square,
E13 1220  3    and on the side directly opposite the gate found a
E13 1220 13    good restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the
E13 1230 11    city. Called the Marmara Gazinosu, it is on the third
E13 1240  7    floor, with signs pointing the way there, and has a
E13 1250  5    terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. After lunch,
E13 1260  1    in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street
E13 1260 12    I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava-
E13 1270 10    a sweet, flaky cake- in Istanbul. It's a great favorite
E13 1280  9    of the university students, and I joined them there
E13 1290  6    for dessert.
E13 1290  8       Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain,
E13 1300  4    I walked ahead, then left down the street opposite
E13 1310  2    St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small,
E13 1320  1    one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the
E13 1320 12    entrance to the Sunken Palace. Actually an underground
E13 1330  6    cistern, its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars,
E13 1340  7    it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply
E13 1350  4    the palace with water. There is still water in it.
E13 1360  1    I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.
E13 1370  1       Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia,
E13 1370  9    turned left at the end of it, and continued toward
E13 1380  8    a gate in the wall ahead. Just before reaching it I
E13 1390  5    came to a grey and brown stone building that looks
E13 1400  1    somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering
E13 1400  9    in gold and colored tile decorations- the Fountain
E13 1410  6    of Sultan Ahmet.
E13 1420  1       Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered
E13 1420 11    the grounds of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans
E13 1430  8    and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire, and walked
E13 1440  5    along a road toward another gate in the distance, past
E13 1450  3    the Church of St. Irene, completed by Constantine in
E13 1460  2    330 A.D. on my left, and then, just outside the second
E13 1470  1    gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right-
E13 1470 15    the Executioner's Spring, where he washed his hands
E13 1480  7    and his sword after beheading his victims.
E13 1490  3       Passing through the gate, with towers on either
E13 1500  1    side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square
E13 1500 11    surrounded by buildings, and on the wall to my right
E13 1510  9    found a general plan of the grounds, with explanations
E13 1520  3    in English for each building. There are a good many
E13 1530  3    of them. At one time about 10,000 people lived there.
E13 1540  1       Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the
E13 1540  9    former kitchens, complete with chimneys, which now
E13 1550  6    house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese
E13 1560  4    porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services.
E13 1570  2    Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils
E13 1580  1    and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length
E13 1580 13    robe.
E13 1590  1       In the court once more, I went right toward the
E13 1590 11    Reception House, a long one-story building with a deep
E13 1600  9    portico. Going through a door into another small court,
E13 1610  5    I had the Throne Room directly in front. I walked to
E13 1620  4    the right around it to buildings containing illuminated
E13 1630  1    manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses
E13 1630  9    such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds, jewelled
E13 1640  6    swords, rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like
E13 1650  6    thrones as large as small beds, on which the sultans
E13 1660  3    sat cross-legged. They are made of gold and covered
E13 1660 13    with emeralds, pearls and other jewels.
E13 1670  6       Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building
E13 1680  7    directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery, I went right
E13 1690  4    at the end of it, through a garden to a small building
E13 1700  1    at the back- a sitting room furnished with low blue
E13 1700 11    divans, its floor covered with carpets, its ceiling
E13 1710  7    painted with gold squares and floral designs.
