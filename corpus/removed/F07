F07 0010  1       SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young
F07 0010  9    couples are a thing of the remote, Victorian past;
F07 0020  9    that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar
F07 0030  4    with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk
F07 0040  3    with friends and personal experimentation to take all
F07 0050  1    the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.
F07 0050  9       Perhaps- but extensive discussions with contemporary
F07 0060  4    practitioners, family doctors and gynecologists indicate
F07 0070  3    that this is still an area of enormous ignorance. Joking
F07 0080  2    and talking may be freer and easier, but the important
F07 0080 12    factual information is still lacking for far too many
F07 0090  9    newly-married men and women.
F07 0100  3       Various factors in the setting can still be of great
F07 0110  1    advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather
F07 0110 10    than a bad memory for one or both. Privacy must be
F07 0120  9    highly assured both in time and place. That is, locking
F07 0130  5    the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location,
F07 0140  2    but it is equally important to be sure there is time
F07 0140 13    enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.
F07 0150  6       If the wedding party lasted late, and the travel
F07 0160  5    schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming
F07 0170  2    the trip or making an early start, the husband may
F07 0170 12    forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to
F07 0180  7    his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss
F07 0190  8    enough for these few hours. The consummation should
F07 0200  3    come at the next stopping place when they have a long
F07 0210  1    private time (day or night) for that purpose.
F07 0210  9    ##
F07 0210 10    First intercourse for the bride brings with it the
F07 0220  8    various problems connected with virginity and the hymen.
F07 0230  6       One thing should be clear to both husband and wife-
F07 0240  5    neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when
F07 0250  2    the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance
F07 0250 12    on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety,
F07 0260 10    misunderstanding and suspicion.
F07 0270  3       The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane that
F07 0280  2    more or less completely covers the entrance to the
F07 0280 11    vagina in most female human beings who have not had
F07 0290  8    sex relations. (Hymen, in fact, is the Greek word for
F07 0300  6    membrane.)
F07 0300  7       Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily
F07 0310  5    to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.
F07 0320  1    As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed
F07 0320 10    very little and perhaps not at all in the process of
F07 0330 10    losing their virginity.
F07 0340  1       It is also important to realize that many girls
F07 0340 10    are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace
F07 0350 10    of one; so that the absence of the hymen is by no means
F07 0360  8    positive proof that a girl has had sex relations.
F07 0370  2       But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations
F07 0380  1    of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly
F07 0380 11    developed that they cannot be torn without considerable
F07 0390  7    pain to the girl and marked loss of blood. More rarely,
F07 0400  6    the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration.
F07 0410  4       Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor
F07 0430  1    has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen
F07 0430 11    to permit marital relations to be consummated. These
F07 0440  6    cases, for all their rarity, are so dramatic that friends
F07 0450  5    and relations repeat the story until the general population
F07 0460  2    may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen
F07 0470  1    is a serious problem to newly-weds.
F07 0475  1    ##
F07 0475  2    In recent times, when sexual matters began to be discussed
F07 0480  6    more scientifically and more openly, the emotional
F07 0490  3    aspects of virginity received considerable attention.
F07 0500  1    Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to
F07 0500  9    make to their new situation. Is it necessary to add
F07 0510  7    to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving
F07 0520  4    husband the one who brought pain to his bride?
F07 0530  1       Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise
F07 0530  8    that the bride should consult a physician before marriage.
F07 0540  7    If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of
F07 0550  6    the hymen, it was recommended that simple procedures
F07 0560  2    be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably,
F07 0570  1    to dilate it.
F07 0570  4       As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often
F07 0580  2    suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation
F07 0580 10    for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.
F07 0590  7       This recommendation was based on the fact that the
F07 0600  8    hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation
F07 0610  2    of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable
F07 0620  2    contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is
F07 0620 11    remembered that, during childbirth, the vagina must
F07 0630  7    dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby.
F07 0640  6       The intricate system of muscles that manage the
F07 0650  3    contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly
F07 0650 11    under voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex
F07 0660  7    may work against the conscious intention of the woman.
F07 0670  5    That is, when first penetration takes place, the pressure
F07 0680  4    and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal
F07 0690  2    muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion
F07 0690 12    and prevent further pain.
F07 0700  3    ##
F07 0700  4    The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both
F07 0710  3    physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional
F07 0720  1    situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making
F07 0720 11    or the beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing
F07 0730  8    size, the vagina is gently, and with minimum pain at
F07 0740  8    each stage, taught to yield to an object of the appropriate
F07 0750  6    shape.
F07 0750  7       In this process the vaginal muscles come under better
F07 0760  5    conscious control by the girl. She learns how to relax
F07 0770  4    them to accept- instead of contracting them to repel
F07 0780  1    the entering object.
F07 0780  4       Apart from the standard problem of controlling the
F07 0790  3    vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that
F07 0800  1    need special gynecological treatment. It is far better
F07 0800  9    to have such conditions treated in advance than to
F07 0810  7    have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create
F07 0820  5    a really serious situation.
F07 0820  9       When no medical problems exist, the newly married
F07 0830  7    couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments
F07 0840  5    of their new relationship by themselves. Special information
F07 0850  2    and guidance about the possible difficulties are still
F07 0860  1    of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered
F07 0860  9    passages from erotic literature can create physical
F07 0870  6    and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific
F07 0880  4    facts and useful hints.
F07 0880  8    ##
F07 0880  9    The importance of loving tenderness is obvious. The
F07 0890  7    long, unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation
F07 0900  4    of fore-play work on several levels. Under the excitement
F07 0910  3    of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes
F07 0920  1    and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases,
F07 0920  9    providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an
F07 0930  6    easier penetration.
F07 0930  8       Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal
F07 0940  6    examinations have established the fact that a single
F07 0950  6    finger inserted along the anterior wall (the top line
F07 0960  4    of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause
F07 0970  1    a great deal of distress in a virgin. But during the
F07 0970 12    same examination, two fingers may be inserted along
F07 0980  7    the posterior wall (the bottom of the vagina in the
F07 0990  7    same position) without any pain; and in fact without
F07 1000  3    any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at
F07 1000 12    all times.
F07 1010  2       These regional differences of sensitivity to pain
F07 1010  9    may be of crucial significance during the earliest
F07 1020  8    intercourse. The husband and wife should start with
F07 1030  6    this anatomical information clearly in mind. They may
F07 1040  4    then adjust their positions and movements to avoid
F07 1040 12    too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall
F07 1050 10    of the vagina; at least until repeated intercourse
F07 1060  5    has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat
F07 1070  4    against the full pleasure of love-making.
F07 1080  1       In fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations
F07 1080  8    may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the
F07 1090  8    husband during the honeymoon.
F07 1100  1       Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a
F07 1100 10    man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and
F07 1110 10    ruthless during the first penetration. The false reasoning
F07 1120  4    is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a
F07 1130  3    swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the
F07 1130 13    girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his
F07 1140  8    decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all.
F07 1150  7       Such talk is seriously in error. Ruthlessness at
F07 1160  3    this time can be a very severe shock to the bride,
F07 1170  1    both physically and psychologically. The insistent,
F07 1170  7    forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal
F07 1180  7    walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen.
F07 1190  4       The pain and distress associated with the performance
F07 1200  3    may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital
F07 1210  1    relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the
F07 1210  9    sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising
F07 1220  7    her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead
F07 1230  4    of relaxing them to facilitate it.
F07 1230 10    ##
F07 1240  1    Serious attention must also be given to the husband's
F07 1240 10    problems in the honeymoon situation. The necessity
F07 1250  6    for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as
F07 1260  5    an interference with the man's spontaneous desire.
F07 1270  2    The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may
F07 1270 12    experience a premature climax. This is a very common
F07 1280  9    experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten
F07 1290  6    either husband or wife.
F07 1290 10       Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself
F07 1300  8    to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him
F07 1310  6    off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously
F07 1320  4    ready for penetration over a long period. The signals
F07 1330  1    to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily
F07 1330 10    not able to take advantage of them.
F07 1340  5       The best course is to recover his physical excitement
F07 1350  2    by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This
F07 1360  1    may require imagination and reminding himself that
F07 1360  8    now he can be demanding and self-centered. He can take
F07 1370  7    security from the fact that the progress he has made
F07 1380  5    by his gentle approach will not be lost.
F07 1390  1       Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses
F07 1390 10    from her, his bride will sympathetically understand
F07 1400  4    the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical
F07 1410  4    situation so they can have the consummation they both
F07 1420  2    so eagerly desire.
F07 1420  5       A final word. The accumulated information on this
F07 1430  3    point shows that first intercourse, even when it is
F07 1430 12    achieved with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom
F07 1440  8    an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman. Too many
F07 1450  7    new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic
F07 1460  5    fulfillment.
F07 1460  6       Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience
F07 1470  5    an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both man and
F07 1480  3    wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax,
F07 1480 15    and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure
F07 1490  9    are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid.
F07 1500  8       If the early approaches are wise, understanding
F07 1510  2    and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment
F07 1520  1    will probably be discovered before the marriage is
F07 1520  9    much older.
F07 1530  1       WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting
F07 1530 11    and sculptures, titled The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,
F07 1540  9    Kenneth Clark declares: "... The human body, as a nucleus,
F07 1550 10    is rich in associations. ... It is ourselves and arouses
F07 1560  7    memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves".
F07 1565  7       Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and
F07 1570  5    power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated
F07 1575  1    by the nude form.
F07 1575  5       The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated
F07 1580  4    in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality. Differences
F07 1590  2    were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.
F07 1600  1    Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were
F07 1600 10    more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated
F07 1610 10    beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved
F07 1620  6    nudity in sexual relations.
F07 1630  1       Such understanding helps to explain why one matron
F07 1630  9    celebrating thirty-five years of married life could
F07 1640  8    declare with some pride that her husband had "never
F07 1650  5    seen her entirely naked", while another woman, boasting
F07 1660  2    an equal number of years of married life, is proud
F07 1660 12    of having "shared the nudist way of life- the really
F07 1670  9    free, natural nude life- for most of that period".
F07 1680  6       Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal
F07 1690  4    such complex and multiple individual reactions. The
F07 1695  2    indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human
F07 1700  2    form as "lewd and pornographic, a threat and danger"
F07 1710  7    to all the young, or good, or religious, or moral persons.
F07 1720  6       The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any
F07 1740  4    kind of censorship may find the nude human form the
F07 1750  1    "natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and
F07 1750  9    the epitome of beauty and inspiration".
F07 1760  5       One is always a little surprised to bump into such
F07 1770  5    individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I still
F07 1780  2    recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material
F07 1780 11    of an enthusiastic advocate of the "clean, healthful,
F07 1790  6    free way of natural life in nudism", who seemed to
F07 1800  6    brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine
F07 1810  3    spirit.
