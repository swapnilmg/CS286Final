K07 0010  1    If the crummy bastard could write! That's how it should
K07 0010 11    be. It's those two fucken niggers! Krist, I wish they
K07 0020 10    could write! Nigger pussy. He thought of sweet wet
K07 0030  8    nigger pussy. Oh, sweet land of heaven, haint there
K07 0050  6    just nothin like sweet nigger pussy! He thought of
K07 0060  4    her, the first one. He had caught her coming out of
K07 0060 15    the shack. She was a juicy one. Oh how they bounced!
K07 0070 11    Fresh, warm, sweet and juicy, sweet lovin sixteen,
K07 0080  7    she was. Man how I love nigger pussy! The snow came
K07 0090  6    a little faster now, he noted. He thought of Joe Harris,
K07 0100  4    the nigger who had gone after his sister. He chuckled,
K07 0110  1    the memory vivid. Jee- sus, We Fixed him! Yooee, we
K07 0120  1    fixed him! The snow again. If only the fucken weather
K07 0120 11    wasn't so lousy! Goddamn niggers, Lord. What I have
K07 0130  9    to put up with! Sonuvabitch, I can't figure out what
K07 0140  7    in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for.
K07 0150  6    Only one worth a shit, and that's Brandon. He ain't
K07 0160  3    so bad ...
K07 0160  6       His thoughts turned to other things ... The big
K07 0170  4    shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those
K07 0180  1    others done for. Kaboom for.
K07 0180  6       He had been pretty scared himself, wondering what
K07 0190  4    the hell was coming off. But he soon saw which way
K07 0200  2    the ball was bouncing. Soon came back to his senses.
K07 0200 12    "I soon came back to my senses", he said, aloud, to
K07 0210 10    the young blizzard, proudly, drawing himself up, as
K07 0220  5    if making a report to some important superior ... I
K07 0230  3    was the first to get my squad on the ball, and anybody
K07 0240  1    thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb. Look at thum.
K07 0240 12    That goddamn redheader was the worst. He kept sayin,
K07 0250  8    not me, not me, I don't wanta wind up like em. But
K07 0260  6    I told him, goddammit. "I told him", he said aloud
K07 0270  4    ... They'll get the guys that done it. That'll put
K07 0280  2    the place back to normal. Normal, by God. Maybe it's
K07 0280 12    a good thing it happened. Maybe they'll stop it now,
K07 0290  9    once for all. Clean the place up. They're doin it now.
K07 0300  8    I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow.
K07 0310  5    They'll get the guys that done it ... There was something
K07 0320  3    troubling him though: as yet they hadn't ... Five days
K07 0330  3    ... Keerist ... Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through
K07 0340  1    him. His eyes blinked hard, snapping on and squashing
K07 0340 10    some bad things that were trying to push their way
K07 0360  6    into him. A tune began to whirl inside his head. One
K07 0370  5    of his favorites: "Guitar Boogie". It always came on,
K07 0380  4    faithfully, just like a radio or juke box, whenever
K07 0380 13    he started to worry too much about something, when
K07 0390  9    the bad things tried to push their way into him. The
K07 0400  8    music drove them off, or away, and he was free to walk
K07 0410  5    on air in a very few moments, humming and jiving within,
K07 0420  1    beating the rhythm within. He glowed with anticipation
K07 0420  9    about what would happen to the culprits when they caught
K07 0430  9    them ... Turn the bastards over to me- to me and my
K07 0440  9    boys- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them-
K07 0450  5    reactionary bastards ... He had never heard the word
K07 0460  3    reactionary before his life as a POW began. It was
K07 0470  1    a word he was proud of, a word that meant much to him,
K07 0470 14    and he used it with great pleasure, almost as if it
K07 0480  8    were an exclusive possession, and more: he sensed himself
K07 0490  5    to be very highly educated, four cuts above any of
K07 0500  3    the folks back home ... "Four cuts at least", he chuckled
K07 0510  1    to himself, "and I owe it all to them". The word also
K07 0520  1    made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled.
K07 0520 11    He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his
K07 0530  8    squad on the ball. It came up again and again in the
K07 0540  6    discussion sessions ... Lousy Reactionary bastards
K07 0550  2    been tryin to fuck up the Program for months. Months.
K07 0550 12    Hired, hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists.
K07 0560  7    Not captured, sent here. To fuck up the Program. You
K07 0570  8    guys remember that. Remember that ... He heard himself
K07 0580  5    haranguing them. He saw himself before them delivering
K07 0590  2    the speech. He laughed, suddenly, feeling a surge of
K07 0590 11    power telling him of his hold over them, seeing himself
K07 0600 10    before them, receiving utmost respect and attention.
K07 0610  5    One day, Ching had told him (smiling, patting him on
K07 0620  4    the back) as they walked to the weekly conference of
K07 0630  2    squad leaders, "Keep it up, your squad is good, one
K07 0630 12    of the best, keep it up, keep up the good work". He
K07 0640 10    would! That was really something, coming from Ching
K07 0650  5    ... "Really something", he said, aloud ... Dirty Reactionary
K07 0660  4    bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off
K07 0670  3    ol Slater and those other poor bastards. "They'll get
K07 0680  2    them by God and let them bring them down here to me,
K07 0680 14    just let them, God I'll slice their balls right off
K07 0690  8    ..." His arm moved swiftly, violently, once, twice.
K07 0700  4    He felt intense satisfaction. He was tingling within.
K07 0710  3    Before him, mutilated, bleeding to death, they lay.
K07 0720  1    It was as if it had been done. "Bastards", he said
K07 0720 12    aloud, spitting on them. He halted, and looked around.
K07 0730  8    Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within
K07 0740  4    him. The thought came back, the one nagging at him
K07 0750  3    these past four days. He tried to stifle it. But the
K07 0750 14    words were forming. He knew he couldn't. He braced
K07 0760  8    himself ... Somebody'll hafta start thinkin ... He
K07 0770  6    fought it, seeking to kill the last few words, but
K07 0780  4    on they came ... bout takin- his ... He was trembling,
K07 0790  2    a strange feeling upon him, fully expecting some catastrophe
K07 0800  1    to strike him dead on the spot. But it didn't. And
K07 0800 12    he took heart; the final word came forth ... place
K07 0810  8    ... Now he heard it, fully: "... bout takin his place
K07 0820  6    ..." He listened, waited, nothing happened. He felt
K07 0830  4    good. His old self. The music arrived, taking him ...
K07 0840  3    its rhythm stroked him, snaked all through him, the
K07 0840 12    lyrics lifted him, took him from one magic isle to
K07 0850 10    another, stopping briefly at each ... Brandon. He is
K07 0860  7    good. Damn good. But a nigger. Johnson. Jesus, the
K07 0870  3    guy says he is trying. But he isn't with it, not at
K07 0880  2    all with it. When I talked to Ching about it, he said,
K07 0880 14    Everyone can learn, if he is not a Reactionary or lazy.
K07 0890 11    No one is stupid. That's what he said. He oughta know.
K07 0900  7    It is plain as hell Johnson is no Reactionary. So you're
K07 0910  5    not tryin, Johnson, you bastard you ... He looked over
K07 0920  5    at him, lying there, asleep, and he felt a wave of
K07 0930  1    revulsion. How he loathed him. Sleepy-eyed, soft-spoken
K07 0930 10    Johnson ... Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken
K07 0940 10    squad ... He was the guy what always goofed at Question
K07 0950  8    Time ... Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone
K07 0960  7    else? Why me? Why didn't the damn Reactionaries bump
K07 0970  4    him off? Why Slater? ... Like a particle drawn to a
K07 0980  4    magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard
K07 0990  1    in his mind. The music surged up, but it failed to
K07 0990 12    check it. Who is the man to take His place? The guy
K07 1000 10    with most on the Ball. Most on the Ball. Handle men.
K07 1010  6    Thoroughly Wised Up. Knows the score ... With a supreme
K07 1020  5    effort, he broke it off. He turned to the window again.
K07 1030  3    A gnawing and gnashing within him. The snow was tumbling
K07 1040  1    down furiously now. Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground,
K07 1040 10    piling higher and higher. He stared at it, amazed,
K07 1050  8    alarmed ... The whole fucken sky's cavin in! Keeeerist!
K07 1060  5    Lookit it! Cover the whole building, bury us all, by
K07 1070  6    nightfall. Jesus! ... Somebody, got to be somebody
K07 1080  2    ... If I don't put my two cents in soon, somebody else
K07 1090  1    will ... I know they're waitin only for one thing:
K07 1090 11    for the bastards what done it to be nailed. Maybe they
K07 1100  9    already got them. He was again tingling with pleasure,
K07 1110  5    seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes. Top dog,
K07 1120  3    sleeping and eating right there with the Staff. Ching,
K07 1130  1    Tien, all of them ... Top dog ... Poor ol Slater ...
K07 1130 13    Jesus, imagine, the crummy bastards, they'll get em,
K07 1140  7    they'll get what's comin to em ... He whirled about
K07 1150  8    suddenly. It was nothing, though his heart was thumping
K07 1160  5    wildly. Somebody was up. That was all.
K07 1170  1       "Boy, you're stirrin early", a sleepy voice said.
K07 1170  8       "Yehhh", said Coughlin, testily, eyeing him up and
K07 1180  8    down.
K07 1180  9       "Lookit that come down, willya", said the man, scratching
K07 1190  9    himself, yawning.
K07 1200  1       "Yehhh", said Coughlin, practically spitting on
K07 1200  7    him.
K07 1210  1       The man moved away.
K07 1210  5       That's the way. They'll toe the line. Goddamn it.
K07 1220  5    Keep the chatter to a minimum, short answers, one word,
K07 1230  3    if possible. Less bull the more you can do with um.
K07 1230 14    That's Brown's trouble. All he does is to bullshit
K07 1240  9    with his squad, and they are the stupidest bastards
K07 1250  7    around. Just about to get their asses kicked into hut
K07 1260  4    Seven. Plenty of room there now. All those dumb 8-Balls
K07 1270  3    croaked. You can do anything with these dumb fucks
K07 1270 12    if you know how. Anything. They'd cut their mothers'
K07 1280  8    belly open. Give um the works. See, he's already snapping
K07 1290  8    it up, the dumb jerk ... Coughlin grinned, feeling
K07 1300  5    supremely on top of things ... He watched the snow
K07 1310  3    once again. It infuriated him. It made no sense to
K07 1310 13    him ... He whirled around, suddenly hot all over, finding
K07 1320 10    the man who had been standing before him a few moments
K07 1330  8    back, nailing him to the spot on which he now stood,
K07 1340  6    open-mouthed-
K07 1340  8       "You- Listen!- name William Foster's Four Internal
K07 1350  8    Contradictions in Capitalism. Quick- Quick- NOW"!
K07 1360  2       The man shrank before the hot fury, searching frantically
K07 1370  6    for the answer ...
K07 1370 10       Finnegan woke up. There was a hell of a noise this
K07 1380 11    time of morning. He stared out the window. For Christ's
K07 1390  6    sake! The whole fucken sky's caved in! He looked for
K07 1400  6    the source of the noise that had awakened him ... It
K07 1410  4    was that prick Coughlin. What the hell was he up to
K07 1420  2    now? Why didn't he drop dead? How did they miss him
K07 1420 13    when they got Slater? How? ... Then he was asking himself
K07 1430 10    the usual early morning questions: What the Hell am
K07 1440  8    I doin here? Is this a nut-house? Am I nuts? Is this
K07 1450 10    for real? Am I dreamin? ...
K07 1460  2       From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice.
K07 1470  1       "How long did you study? How long, buddy"?
K07 1470  9       "For Christ's sake"! a voice pleaded.
K07 1480  6       "Don't Christsake me, buddy! Just answer. C'mon-
K07 1490  6    c'mon!"
K07 1500  1       ... I'm no hero. Did I start the damn war? ... Automatically,
K07 1510  1    Finnegan started going over today's lesson ... Capitalism
K07 1510  9    rots from the core. Did I start the damn war? Who did?
K07 1520 11    That's a good one. I thought I knew. Why don't Uncle
K07 1530  9    Sam mind his own fucken business? I'll bet both together
K07 1540  6    did. I bet. So fuck them both. Goddamn. Goddammit.
K07 1550  3    Just let me go home to Jersey, back to the shore, oh,
K07 1560  3    Jesus, the shore. The waves breakin in on you and your
K07 1560 14    girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight
K07 1570 11    even Jesus sweet Mary. If I hafta do this to stay alive
K07 1580 10    by God I'll do it. I hated the goddamn army from the
K07 1590  7    first day I got in anyhow. All pricks like Coughlin
K07 1600  3    run it anyway, one way or another. Fuck them ... He
K07 1610  1    rolled over and tried to shut out the noise, now much
K07 1610 12    louder. He snuggled into the blanket ...
K07 1620  5    ##
K07 1620  6    Brandon dreamed. He was sitting on top of a log which
K07 1630  7    was spinning round and around in the water. A river,
K07 1640  2    wide as the Missouri, where it ran by his place. The
K07 1640 13    log was spinning. But he was not. So what? Why should
K07 1650 10    I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning?
K07 1660  7    (he asked this out loud, but no one heard it over the
K07 1670  7    other noise in the hut). Over on the bank, the west
K07 1680  3    bank, a man stood, calling to him. He couldn't make
K07 1680 13    out what he was saying. No doubt it had to do with
K07 1690 12    the log. Why should he be concerned?
