K05 0010  1    Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins
K05 0010 10    to Herold. There was a fog, which increased the darkness
K05 0020  9    of the night. Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading
K05 0030  8    glow. He might have been anywhere or nowhere.
K05 0040  3       The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription
K05 0050  1    from Dr. Verdi. Secretary of State Seward was a sick
K05 0050 11    man. The idea had come from Herold, who had once been
K05 0060 11    a chemist's clerk. The sick were always receiving medicines.
K05 0070  7    No one would question such an errand. The bottle was
K05 0080  7    filled up with flour.
K05 0080 11       Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse, Seward's
K05 0090  6    home, where Key had once been killed. Now it would
K05 0100  6    have another death. From the outside it was an ordinary
K05 0110  4    enough house of the gentry. He clomped heavily up the
K05 0120  1    stoop and rang the bell. Like the bell at Mass, the
K05 0120 12    doorbell was pitched too high. It was still Good Friday,
K05 0130  8    after all.
K05 0130 10       A nigger boy opened the door. Payne did not notice
K05 0140  9    him. He was thinking chiefly of Cap. If their schedules
K05 0150  6    were to synchronize, there was no point in wasting
K05 0160  3    time. He pushed his way inside.
K05 0160  9       For a moment the hall confused him. This was the
K05 0170  8    largest house he had ever been in, almost the largest
K05 0180  4    building, except for a hotel. He had no idea where
K05 0190  1    Seward's room would be. In the half darkness the banisters
K05 0190 11    gleamed, and the hall seemed enormous. Above him somewhere
K05 0200  9    were the bedrooms. Seward would be up there.
K05 0210  6       He explained his errand, but without bothering much
K05 0220  3    to make it plausible, for he felt something well up
K05 0230  2    in him which was the reason why he had fled the army.
K05 0230 14    He did not really want to kill, but as in the sexual
K05 0240 10    act, there was a moment when the impulse took over
K05 0250  5    and could not be downed, even while you watched yourself
K05 0260  2    giving way to it. He was no longer worried. Everything
K05 0260 12    would be all right. He knew that in this mood he could
K05 0270 12    not be stopped.
K05 0280  1       Still, the sensation always surprised him. It was
K05 0280  9    a thrill he felt no part in. He could only watch with
K05 0290 10    a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick,
K05 0300  6    appalling, and efficient things.
K05 0310  1       He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily
K05 0310  9    up the stairs. They were carpeted, but made for pumps
K05 0320  7    and congress gaiters, not the great clodhoppers he
K05 0330  3    wore. The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled
K05 0340  1    drum.
K05 0340  2       At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing
K05 0340 13    there angrily in a dressing gown. He stopped and whispered
K05 0350 10    his errand. Young Frederick Seward held out his hand.
K05 0360  8    Panting a little, Payne shook his head. Dr. Verdi had
K05 0370  7    told him to deliver his package in person.
K05 0380  2       Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping, and
K05 0380 10    then went through a pantomime at his father's door,
K05 0390  9    to prove the statement.
K05 0400  1       "Very well", Payne said. "I will go". He smiled,
K05 0410  1    but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he
K05 0410 12    did not intend to go. He pulled out his pistol and
K05 0420  9    fired it. It made no sound. It had misfired. Reversing
K05 0430  4    it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's
K05 0440  2    head, over and over again.
K05 0440  7       It was the first blow that was always difficult.
K05 0450  5    After that, violence was exultantly easy. He got caught
K05 0460  4    up into it and became a different person. Only afterwards
K05 0470  1    did an act like that become meaningless, so that he
K05 0470 11    would puzzle over it for days, whereas at the time
K05 0480  8    it had seemed quite real.
K05 0490  1       The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming,
K05 0490  9    "Murder".
K05 0500  1       It was not murder at all. Payne was more methodical
K05 0500 10    than that. He was merely clearing a way to what he
K05 0510  9    had to do.
K05 0510 12       He ran for the sick room, found his pistol was broken,
K05 0520  8    and threw it away. A knife would do. From childhood
K05 0530  4    he had known all about knives. Someone blocked the
K05 0540  2    door from inside. He smashed it in and tumbled into
K05 0540 12    darkness. He saw only dimly moving figures, but when
K05 0550  9    he slashed them they yelled and fled. He went for the
K05 0560  7    bed, jumped on it, and struck where he could, repeatedly.
K05 0570  2    It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares
K05 0580  1    to punish one's dreams.
K05 0580  5       Two men pulled him off. Nobody said anything. Payne
K05 0590  4    hacked at their arms. There was a lady there, in a
K05 0600  2    nightdress. He would not have wanted to hurt a lady.
K05 0600 12    Another man approached, this one fully dressed. When
K05 0610  7    the knife went into his chest, he went down at once.
K05 0620  6       "I'm mad", shouted Payne, as he ran out into the
K05 0630  6    hall. "I'm mad", and only wished he had been. That
K05 0640  2    would have made things so much easier. But he was not
K05 0640 13    mad. He was only dreaming.
K05 0650  4       He clattered down the stairs and out of the door.
K05 0660  3    Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling
K05 0660 13    murder. One always wakes up, even from one's own dreams.
K05 0670 10    The clammy air revived him. Herold, he saw, had fled.
K05 0680  8       Well, one did not expect much of people like Herold.
K05 0690  6       He unhitched his horse, walked it away, mounted,
K05 0700  4    and spurred it on. The nigger boy was close behind
K05 0710  2    him. Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone.
K05 0710 13    He rode on and on. He had no idea where he was. After
K05 0720 12    some time he came to an open field. An open field was
K05 0730  8    better than a building, that was for sure, so he dismounted,
K05 0740  5    turned off the horse, and plunged through the grass.
K05 0750  2       He felt curiously sleepy, the world seemed far away;
K05 0760  1    he knew he should get to Cap, but he didn't know how.
K05 0760 13    He was sure, for he had done as he was told, hadn't
K05 0770 10    he? Cap would find him and take care of him. So choosing
K05 0780  8    a good tree, he clambered up into it, found a comfortable
K05 0790  4    notch, and curled up in it to sleep, like the tousled
K05 0800  1    bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though
K05 0800 12    surfeited with honey.
K05 0810  3       Violence always made him tired, but he was not frightened.
K05 0820  2    ##
K05 0820  3    In Boston, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance
K05 0830  1    of A New Way to Pay Old Debts. It was a part so familiar
K05 0840  1    to him that he did not bother to think about it any
K05 0840 13    more. Acting soothed him. On a stage he always knew
K05 0850  8    what to do, and tonight, to judge by the applause,
K05 0860  4    he must be doing it better than usual.
K05 0860 12       As Sir Giles Overreach (how often had he had to
K05 0870 10    play that part, who did not believe a word of it),
K05 0880  7    he raised his arm and declaimed: "Where is my honour
K05 0890  4    now"?
K05 0890  5       That was one of the high spots of the play. The
K05 0900  3    audience, as usual, loved it. He was delighted to see
K05 0900 13    them so happy. If he had any worries, it was only the
K05 0910 12    small ones, about Mother in New York, and his daughter
K05 0920  8    Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour, with
K05 0930  6    her Aunt Asia, in Philadelphia.
K05 0940  1       Everyone is ambivalent about his profession, if
K05 0940  7    he has practised it long enough, but there were still
K05 0950  6    moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen
K05 0960  3    people out there, who might cheer you or boo you, but
K05 0960 14    that was largely, though not entirely, up to you.
K05 0970  9       They made the world seem friendly somehow, though
K05 0980  6    he knew it was not.
K05 0980 11    #VII#
K05 0980 12    Wilkes was quite right about one thing. Laura Keene
K05 0990  9    had been in the green room. The commotion had brought
K05 1000  7    her into the wings. Since she could not act, one part
K05 1010  6    suited her as well as any other, and so she was the
K05 1020  2    first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water,
K05 1020 12    holding it up to the box, high above her head, to Miss
K05 1040 11    Harris, who had asked for it.
K05 1050  2       She had been one of the first to collect her wits.
K05 1060  1       It was not so much that the shot had stunned the
K05 1060 12    audience, as that they had been stunned already. Most
K05 1070  7    of them had seen Our American Cousin before, and unless
K05 1080  5    Miss Keene was on stage, there was not much to it.
K05 1090  4    The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.
K05 1100  1       The stage had been empty, except for Harry Hawk,
K05 1100 10    doing his star monologue. The audience was fond of
K05 1110  7    Harry Hawk, he was a dear, in or out of character,
K05 1120  6    but he was not particularly funny. At the end of the
K05 1130  3    monologue the audience would applaud. Meanwhile it
K05 1130 10    looked at the scenery.
K05 1140  3       "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside
K05 1150  1    out, you sockdologizing old mantrap"! said Trenchard,
K05 1150  8    otherwise Hawk. There was always a pause here, before
K05 1160  9    the next line.
K05 1170  1       That was when the gun went off. Yet even that explosion
K05 1170 12    did not mean much. Guns were going off all over Washington
K05 1180  9    City these days, because of the celebrations, and the
K05 1190  6    theatre was not soundproof.
K05 1200  1       Then the audience saw a small, dim figure appear
K05 1200  9    at the edge of the Presidential box. "Sic semper tyrannis",
K05 1210  5    it said mildly. Booth had delivered his line. Behind
K05 1220  6    him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke.
K05 1230  3       They strained forward. They had not heard what had
K05 1240  1    been said. They had been sitting too long to be able
K05 1240 12    to stand up easily. The figure leapt from the box,
K05 1250  7    almost lost its balance, the flag draped there tore
K05 1260  4    in the air, the figure landed on its left leg, fell
K05 1270  1    on its hands, and pressed itself up.
K05 1270  8       Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the
K05 1280  5    wings. His speech faltered. He did not lower his arm.
K05 1290  3       The figure was so theatrically dressed, that it
K05 1290 11    was as though a character from some other play had
K05 1300  8    blundered into this one. The play for Saturday night
K05 1310  5    was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon. This
K05 1320  2    figure looked like the slave dealer from that. But
K05 1320 11    it also looked like a toad, hopping away from the light.
K05 1330 11    There was something maimed and crazy about its motion
K05 1340  7    that disturbed them.
K05 1340 10       Then it disappeared into the wings.
K05 1350  6       Harry Hawk had not shifted position, but he at last
K05 1360  6    lowered his arm.
K05 1360  9       Mrs. Lincoln screamed. There was no mistaking that
K05 1380  6    scream. It was what anyone who had ever seen her had
K05 1390  4    always expected her to do. Yet this scream had a different
K05 1400  1    note in it. That absence of an urgent self-indulgence
K05 1400 11    dashed them awake like a pail of water.
K05 1410  7       Clara Harris, one of the guests in the box, stood
K05 1420  5    up and demanded water. Her action was involuntary.
K05 1430  1    When something unexpected happened, one always asked
K05 1430  8    for water if one were a woman, brandy if one were a
K05 1440 10    man.
K05 1440 11       Mrs. lincoln screamed again.
K05 1450  2       In the Presidential box someone leaned over the
K05 1460  1    balustrade and yelled: "He has shot the President"!
K05 1470  1       That got everybody up. On the stage, Harry Hawk
K05 1470  9    began to weep. Laura Keene brushed by him with the
K05 1480  6    glass of water. The crowd began to move. In Washington
K05 1490  3    City everyone lived in a bubble of plots, and one death
K05 1500  1    might attract another. It was not exactly panic they
K05 1500 10    gave way to, but they could not just sit there. The
K05 1510  9    beehive voices, for no one could bear silence, drowned
K05 1520  4    out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping.
K05 1530  1       At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men
K05 1530 10    tried to push open the door to the box corridor. It
K05 1540 10    would not give.
K05 1540 13       A Dr. Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and
K05 1550 10    got the actors to hoist him up to the box. In the audience
K05 1560 10    a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue
K05 1570  7    a little girl from the mob, on the same principle which
K05 1580  2    had led Miss Harris to demand water.
K05 1580  9       Someone opened the corridor door from the inside,
K05 1590  8    and called for a doctor. Somehow Dr. Charles Leale
K05 1600  4    was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the
K05 1610  3    dingy corridor. He went straight to the Presidential
K05 1610 11    box.
K05 1620  1       As usual, Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head, but nobody
K05 1620 11    blamed her for doing so now. There was a little blood
K05 1630 11    on the hem of her dress, for the assassin had slashed
K05 1640  6    Miss Harris's companion, Major Rathbone, with a knife.
K05 1650  5    Rathbone said he was bleeding to death. By the look
K05 1660  3    of him he wasn't that far gone.
