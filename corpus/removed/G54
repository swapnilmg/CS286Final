G54 0010  1    When Fred wheeled him back into his room, the big one
G54 0010 12    looking out on the back porch, and put him to bed,
G54 0020  9    Papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed
G54 0030  6    greatly the trip downtown. "I've been cooped up so
G54 0040  3    long", he added. Getting out again, seeing old friends,
G54 0050  1    had given his spirits a lift.
G54 0050  7       That night after supper I went back over to 48 Spruce
G54 0060  6    Street- Ralph and I at that time were living at 168
G54 0070  3    Chestnut- and Ralph went with me. Papa was still elated
G54 0080  1    over his afternoon visit downtown. "Baby, I saw a lot
G54 0080 11    of old friends I hadn't seen in a long time", he told
G54 0090 10    me, his eyes bright. "It was mighty good for the old
G54 0100  8    man to get out again".
G54 0100 13       The next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape
G54 0110 11    and still in excellent spirits. But a few days after
G54 0120  7    Fred's return he began hemorrhaging and that was the
G54 0130  5    beginning of early and complete disintegration. It
G54 0140  1    began in the morning, and very quickly the hemorrhage
G54 0140 10    was a massive one. We got Dr. Glenn to him as quickly
G54 0150  9    as we could, and we wired Tom of Papa's desperate condition.
G54 0160  6    The hemorrhage was in the prostate region; Dr. Glenn
G54 0170  4    saw at once what had happened.
G54 0170 10       "He has lost much blood", he said. "It'll take a
G54 0180 10    lot to replace it".
G54 0190  2       "Dr. Glenn, I've got a lot of blood", Fred spoke
G54 0200  2    up, "plenty of it. Let me give Papa blood".
G54 0200 11       The doctor agreed, but explained that it would be
G54 0210  8    necessary first to check Fred's blood to ascertain
G54 0220  4    whether or not it was of the same type as Papa's. To
G54 0230  3    give a patient the wrong type of blood, said the doctor,
G54 0240  1    would likely kill him.
G54 0240  5       That was in the days before blood banks, of course,
G54 0250  3    and transfusions had to be given directly from donor
G54 0250 12    to patient. One had to find a donor, and usually very
G54 0260 11    quickly, whose blood corresponded with the patient's.
G54 0270  5    And then it took considerably longer to make preparations
G54 0280  5    for giving transfusions. They had to take blood samples
G54 0290  3    to the laboratory to test them, for one thing, and
G54 0290 13    there was much required preliminary procedure.
G54 0300  6       They made the tests and came to Fred; by now it
G54 0310  8    was perhaps two days or longer after Papa had begun
G54 0320  3    hemorrhaging.
G54 0320  4       "Fred, your blood matches your father's, all right",
G54 0330  4    Dr. Glenn said. "But we aren't going to let you give
G54 0340  5    him any".
G54 0340  7       "But why in the name of God can't I give my father
G54 0350  5    blood"? Fred demanded. "Why can't I, Doctor"?
G54 0360  2       "Because, Fred, it could do him no good. It's too
G54 0370  2    late now. He's past helping. He's as good as gone".
G54 0380  1       And in a few minutes Papa was dead. It was well
G54 0380 12    past midnight. Papa had left us about the same hour
G54 0390  9    of the night that Ben had passed on. The date was June
G54 0400  6    20, 1922.
G54 0400  8       "W. O. Wolfe, prominent business man and pioneer
G54 0410  6    resident of this section, died shortly after midnight
G54 0420  3    Tuesday at his home 48 Spruce Street", the Asheville
G54 0430  1    Times of Wednesday, June 21, announced. "Mr. Wolfe
G54 0440  1    had been in declining health for many years and death
G54 0440 11    was not unexpected". A biographical sketch followed.
G54 0450  5       Funeral services were held Thursday afternoon at
G54 0460  5    four o'clock at the home. Beloved Dr. R. F. Campbell,
G54 0470  4    our First Presbyterian Church pastor, was in charge.
G54 0480  3    The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery. All about
G54 0480 12    him stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands
G54 0490  8    had fashioned.
G54 0500  1       A few years before his death Papa had agreed with
G54 0500 11    Mama to make a joint will with her in which it would
G54 0510  9    be provided that in the event of the death of either
G54 0530  4    of them an accounting would be made to their children
G54 0540  1    whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000
G54 0540 10    cash. At his death Fred and Ralph, my husband, were
G54 0550  7    named executors of the estate under the terms of the
G54 0560  5    will.
G54 0560  6       Fred and Ralph qualified as executors and paid off
G54 0570  4    what debts were currently due, and they were all current,
G54 0580  1    since Papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid.
G54 0580 12    The bills were principally for hospitalization and
G54 0590  6    doctors' fees during the last years of his life, and
G54 0600  7    when he died he owed in the main only current doctor's
G54 0610  2    bills. After they had paid all his debts and the funeral
G54 0620  1    costs, Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars,
G54 0620 10    as I remember, with which to pay the bequests. This,
G54 0630  8    manifestly, would not provide $5000 to each of the
G54 0640  7    surviving five children.
G54 0640 10       So what Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate
G54 0650 10    the money fairly by taking into account what each of
G54 0660  6    the five had received, if anything, from the estate
G54 0670  3    before Papa's death. Consequently, Fred and Tom, the
G54 0680  1    two who had been provided college educations, signed
G54 0680  9    statements to the effect that each had received his
G54 0690  7    bequest in full, and Effie and I were each allotted
G54 0700  4    $5000. Frank had been given about half his legacy to
G54 0710  2    use in a business venture before Papa's death; he was
G54 0710 12    given the difference between that amount and $5000.
G54 0720  7    Tom had received four years of education at the University
G54 0730  6    of North Carolina and two at Harvard, and Fred had
G54 0740  4    been in and out of Georgia Tech and Carneigie Tech
G54 0750  2    and part of the time had been a self-help student.
G54 0750 13    So, because he had received less than Tom, it was felt
G54 0760 10    proper that Fred should receive the few hundred dollars
G54 0770  5    that remained. And that's how Papa's estate was divided.
G54 0780  4       Papa, I should emphasize, had been an invalid the
G54 0790  3    last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor
G54 0800  1    bills had been large and his income had been cut until
G54 0800 12    he was receiving little except small rentals on some
G54 0810  5    properties he still owned. Had he been able to escape
G54 0820  6    this long siege of invalidism, I'm convinced, Papa
G54 0830  2    would have left a sizable estate. But he had succeeded
G54 0830 12    well, we agreed. He had left us a legacy far more valuable
G54 0840 10    than houses and lands and stocks and bonds.
G54 0850  5       For years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers.
G54 0860  2    I recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800.
G54 0870  1    In those years of lower property valuations and lower
G54 0870 10    tax rates, that payment represented ownership of much
G54 0880  6    property.
G54 0880  7       "Merciful God, Julia"! I have known Papa to exclaim
G54 0890  8    on getting his tax bill, "we're going to the dogs"!
G54 0900  6       But he never expected to do that. And he didn't,
G54 0910  6    by a long shot!
G54 0910 10    #35.#
G54 0910 11    In the spring of his second year at Harvard, Tom had
G54 0920  9    been offered a job at Northwestern University as an
G54 0930  4    instructor in the English Department. But he had delayed
G54 0940  4    accepting this job, and as he was leaving to come home
G54 0950  1    to Papa in response to our telegram, he dropped a postcard
G54 0950 12    to Miss McCrady, head of the Harvard Appointment Office,
G54 0960  8    asking her please to write Northwestern authorities
G54 0970  5    and explain the circumstances.
G54 0980  1       Actually Tom had been postponing giving them an
G54 0980  9    answer, I'm confident, because he did not want to go
G54 0990  9    out there to teach. In fact, he didn't want to teach
G54 1000  6    anywhere. He wanted to go back to Harvard for another
G54 1010  3    year of playwriting. But Papa's death had further complicated
G54 1020  1    the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year, and for
G54 1020 11    the weeks following it Tom did not know whether his
G54 1030 10    return to Harvard could be arranged.
G54 1040  3       But things were worked out in the family and late
G54 1050  2    in August he wrote Miss McCrady an explanatory letter
G54 1050 11    in which he told her that matters at home had been
G54 1060 10    in an unsettled condition after Papa's death and he
G54 1070  6    had not known whether he would stay at home with Mama,
G54 1080  3    accept the Northwestern job, or return to Harvard.
G54 1080 11    But he was happy to tell her that his finances were
G54 1090 11    now in such condition that he could go back to Harvard
G54 1100  8    for a third year with Professor Baker.
G54 1110  2       And that's what he did. That third year he wrote
G54 1110 12    plays with a fury. I believe there are seventeen short
G54 1120 10    plays by Tom now housed in the Houghton Library at
G54 1130  7    Harvard; I think I'm right in that figure. That fall
G54 1140  6    he submitted to Professor Baker the first acts and
G54 1150  3    outlines of the following acts of several plays, six
G54 1150 12    of them, according to some of his associates, and he
G54 1160  9    also worked on a play that he first called Niggertown,
G54 1170  6    the material for which he had collected during the
G54 1180  3    summer at home. Later this play would be called Welcome
G54 1190  1    to Our City. In the spring, it must have been, he began
G54 1200  1    working on the play that he called The House, which
G54 1200 11    later would be Mannerhouse. That spring Welcome to
G54 1210  7    Our City was selected for production by the 47 Workshop
G54 1220  7    and it was staged in the middle of May. It ran two
G54 1230  6    nights, and though it was generally praised, there
G54 1240  1    was considerable criticism of its length. It ran until
G54 1240 10    past one o'clock. That was Tom's weakness; it was demonstrated,
G54 1250  8    many critics would later point out, in the length of
G54 1260  9    his novels. In this play there were so many characters
G54 1270  6    and so much detail. Tom never knew how to condense,
G54 1290  3    to boil down. He was always concerned with life, and
G54 1290 13    he tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed,
G54 1300 10    tight. He was a big man, and he wanted nothing little,
G54 1310 10    squeezed; he despised parsimony, and particularly of
G54 1320  4    words. In this play there were some thirty or more
G54 1330  3    named characters and I don't know how many more unnamed.
G54 1340  1    In describing it to Professor Baker after it had been
G54 1340 11    chosen for production, he defended his great array
G54 1350  7    of characters by declaring that he had included that
G54 1360  5    many not because "I didn't know how to save paint",
G54 1370  2    but because the play required them. And he threatened
G54 1370 11    someday to write a play "with fifty, eighty, a hundred
G54 1380 10    people- a whole town, a whole race, a whole epoch".
G54 1390  8    He said he would do it, though probably nobody would
G54 1400  4    produce it, for his own "soul's ease and comfort".
G54 1410  2       That summer Tom attended the summer session at Harvard,
G54 1420  1    but he did not ask Mama to send him back in the fall.
G54 1420 14    Instead, he went down to New York and submitted Welcome
G54 1430 10    to Our City to the Theatre Guild, which had asked him
G54 1440  9    to let them have a look at it after Professor Baker
G54 1450  5    had recommended it highly. He hung around New York,
G54 1460  3    waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production
G54 1470  1    and in that time came down to Asheville and also paid
G54 1470 12    a short visit to Chapel Hill, where with almost childish
G54 1480  8    delight he visited old friends and favorite campus
G54 1490  5    spots. On returning to New York he had a job for several
G54 1500  5    weeks; it was visiting University of North Carolina
G54 1510  1    alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to
G54 1510 11    the Graham Memorial Building fund. The Graham Memorial
G54 1520  7    would be the campus student union honoring the late
G54 1530  6    and much beloved Edward Kidder Graham, who had been
G54 1540  4    president when Tom entered the university.
G54 1550  1       Well, the Theatre Guild kept that play, and kept
G54 1550  9    it, and finally in December they turned it down. But
G54 1560  7    they would reconsider it, they assured him, if he would
G54 1570  5    rewrite it. Tom told me about it, how one evening he
G54 1580  2    went over to see the Theatre Guild man. This man, Tom
G54 1580 13    said, had the play shut up in his desk, I believe,
G54 1590 11    and when Tom sat down, he pulled it out and apologetically
G54 1600  7    told Tom that they wouldn't be able to use it.
G54 1610  5       Tom said he almost burst into tears, he was so disappointed
G54 1620  2    and put out. The man, Tom said, explained that it was
G54 1630  1    not only too long and detailed but that as it stood
G54 1630 12    it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted. The
G54 1640  7    public, Tom said the man told him, wanted realism,
G54 1650  3    and his play wasn't that. It was fantastic writing,
G54 1660  1    beautiful writing, the man declared, but the public,
G54 1660  9    he insisted, wanted realism.
G54 1670  3       Tom was not willing to revise the play according
G54 1680  1    to the plan the man suggested. Such a revision, he
G54 1680 11    said, would ruin it, would change his whole conception
G54 1690  7    of the play as well as the treatment. He thought about
G54 1700  4    it and he told the man he just couldn't do it over
G54 1710  3    in accordance with the suggestions he had made.
