F08 0010  1       @ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is
F08 0010 11    a place of unity and harmony. The partners each bring
F08 0020  9    to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal
F08 0030  7    share of pleasure and joy.
F08 0030 12       At its most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are
F08 0040  8    elevated far above worldly cares. Everything else is
F08 0050  5    closed away.
F08 0050  7       This is the ideal. But marriage experts say that
F08 0060  6    such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom
F08 0070  3    achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates
F08 0070 11    the sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the
F08 0080 10    husband who has been dominant and the wife passive.
F08 0090  6    But today there are signs that these roles are being
F08 0100  4    reversed.
F08 0100  5       In a growing number of American homes, marriage
F08 0110  2    counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding
F08 0110 10    role in sexual relationships. It is she who decides
F08 0120  9    the time, the place, the surroundings, and the frequency
F08 0130  6    of the sexual act. It is she who says aye or nay to
F08 0140  6    the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-
F08 0150  3    not the husband. The whole act is tailored to her pleasure,
F08 0160  1    and not to theirs.
F08 0160  5       Beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can
F08 0170  4    be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is
F08 0170 14    little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss
F08 0180 10    of the marital bed.
F08 0190  1       Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages
F08 0190  9    in which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even
F08 0200  9    in these marriages, psychologists say, wives are asserting
F08 0210  6    themselves more strongly. The meekest, most submissive
F08 0220  4    wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's
F08 0230  3    standards.
F08 0230  4       To many experts, this trend was inevitable. They
F08 0240  3    consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society
F08 0250  1    has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence
F08 0250  9    and new authority. It is only natural that she assert
F08 0260  9    herself in the sexual role.
F08 0270  2       "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum",
F08 0280  1    declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director
F08 0280  8    of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and
F08 0290  7    author of the recent book, Release From Sexual Tensions.
F08 0300  6    "It reflects what is going on in other areas of the
F08 0310  7    marriage and in society itself. A world in which wives
F08 0320  4    have taken a more active role is likely to produce
F08 0320 14    sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive,
F08 0330  9    too".
F08 0340  1       Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree
F08 0340  8    that domination of the sex relationship by one partner
F08 0350  8    or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous. It
F08 0360  5    can, in fact, wreck a marriage.
F08 0360 11       When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless
F08 0370  8    of his wife's desires, she is cheated of the fulfillment
F08 0380  6    and pleasure nature intended for her. And she begins
F08 0390  4    to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.
F08 0400  1       On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the
F08 0400  9    husband, saps his self-respect, and robs him of his
F08 0410  6    masculinity. He is a target of ridicule to his wife,
F08 0420  4    and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-
F08 0430  3    to the outside world as well.
F08 0430  9       "A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress
F08 0440  5    except an open and direct challenge to the husband's
F08 0450  1    maleness", declares Dr. Calderone. This opinion is
F08 0450  8    supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists,
F08 0460  8    Dr. Maurice E. Linden, director of the Mental Health
F08 0470  8    Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.
F08 0480  5       "When the roles of husband and wife are reversed,
F08 0490  6    so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower",
F08 0500  3    Dr. Linden says, "the effects on their whole relationship,
F08 0510  2    sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous".
F08 0510  8    ##
F08 0520  1    IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist,
F08 0520 10    an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations
F08 0530  8    with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries
F08 0540  7    she demanded. To win her favors, her husband first
F08 0550  3    took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle
F08 0560  1    from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced
F08 0560 10    to prison. While he was in custody his wife divorced
F08 0570  8    him.
F08 0570  9       More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island
F08 0580  8    housewife described by a marriage counselor. This woman
F08 0590  4    repeatedly complained she was "too tired" for marital
F08 0600  3    relations. To please her, her husband assumed some
F08 0600 11    of the domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing
F08 0610  8    dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing- and
F08 0620  6    still his wife refused to have relations as often as
F08 0630  4    he desired them.
F08 0630  7       One wife, described by a New York psychologist,
F08 0640  4    so dominated her husband that she actually placed their
F08 0650  2    sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down
F08 0650 10    right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night
F08 0660  9    neighborhood card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents
F08 0670 11    basis. After every money argument, she rebuffed her
F08 0680  7    husband's overtures until the matter was settled in
F08 0690  5    her favor.
F08 0690  7       Experts say the partners in marriages like these
F08 0700  4    can almost be typed.
F08 0700  8       The wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart
F08 0710  6    as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising
F08 0720  3    career for marriage. She knows the power of the sex
F08 0730  2    urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.
F08 0730 12       The husband is usually a well-educated professional,
F08 0740  7    preoccupied with his job- often an organization man
F08 0750  7    whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't rock the boat".
F08 0760  4       Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly
F08 0770  2    dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable
F08 0770 12    to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be
F08 0780 12    supreme in at least one area.
F08 0790  2       More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting
F08 0800  1    to authority on the job without argument that he lives
F08 0800 11    by the same rule at home.
F08 0810  3       Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound
F08 0820  1    husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages
F08 0820 11    than their wives. The wife's attempt at control, these
F08 0830  8    psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic
F08 0840  6    effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention
F08 0850  4    to her as he does to his job.
F08 0850 12       Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize
F08 0860  6    the sexual initiative. Unless her husband also desires
F08 0870  4    sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally, however,
F08 0880  2    in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at
F08 0880 12    his wife's mercy.
F08 0890  2       "The pattern", says Dr. Morton Schillinger, psychologist
F08 0900  2    at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy,
F08 0910  1    "is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly,
F08 0910 11    virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash
F08 0920  9    him the signal that tonight is the night".
F08 0930  4       No one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering
F08 0940  3    wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our
F08 0940 12    world. After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish
F08 0950  9    wife is a comic figure of long standing, in literature
F08 0960  7    and on the stage, as Dr. Schillinger points out. There
F08 0970  4    is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly
F08 0980  3    emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the
F08 0980 11    master bedroom.
F08 0990  2    ##
F08 0990  3    FURTHERMORE, Dr. Calderone says, a certain number of
F08 1000  3    docile, retiring men always have been around. They
F08 1000 11    aren't "frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're
F08 1010  7    just restrained in all of life. They like to be dominated.
F08 1020 10    One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik, New
F08 1030  7    York psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife
F08 1040  6    the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied primly:
F08 1050  2    "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".
F08 1060  1       But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society
F08 1060 10    here and abroad has been built around the dominating
F08 1070  7    male- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept.
F08 1080  5       Family survival on our own Western frontier, for
F08 1090  2    example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength
F08 1100  1    and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent
F08 1100 11    wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything,
F08 1110  6    including the marriage bed.
F08 1120  1       This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th
F08 1120 10    and early 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost
F08 1130  9    in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner.
F08 1140  5       In those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the
F08 1150  5    domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.
F08 1160  1    "Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr. Marion Hilliard,
F08 1170  1    the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude
F08 1170 10    of the '90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought
F08 1180  8    of themselves as "used" by their husbands- and, history
F08 1190  7    indicates, they often quite literally were.
F08 1200  3       When was the turning point? When did women begin
F08 1210  2    to assert themselves sexually?
F08 1210  6    ##
F08 1210  7    SOME DATE IT from woman suffrage, others from when
F08 1220  6    women first began to challenge men in the marketplace,
F08 1230  4    still others from the era of the emancipated flapper
F08 1240  1    and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however,
F08 1240  8    that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness
F08 1250  5    was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush
F08 1260  4    to the suburbs.
F08 1260  7       Left alone while her husband was miles away in the
F08 1270  6    city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties
F08 1280  1    normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave
F08 1280  8    her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing, money-handling
F08 1290  7    and home maintenance. She found she could cope with
F08 1300  7    all kinds of problems for which she was once considered
F08 1310  3    too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and
F08 1320  1    independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to
F08 1320  9    give it up.
F08 1330  1       "Very few wives", says Dr. Calderone, "who balance
F08 1330  9    the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family
F08 1340  8    will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly
F08 1350  5    going to become submissive where sex is concerned.
F08 1360  1    A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate
F08 1360 10    the sexual relationship as well".
F08 1370  5       And an additional factor was helping to make women
F08 1380  5    more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively recent
F08 1390  2    discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.
F08 1400  1    Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began
F08 1400  8    to stress the importance of the female climax. They
F08 1410  7    began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for
F08 1420  4    response.
F08 1420  5       In fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher,
F08 1430  4    Dr. Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that women are
F08 1440  3    "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr. Ellis,
F08 1450  1    the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of
F08 1450 11    far greater sexual arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly,
F08 1460  7    Dr. Ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are
F08 1470  6    out to claim these capabilities.
F08 1480  1       Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr. Maurice Linden,
F08 1480  8    many wives despise their husbands for not standing
F08 1490  8    up to them. An aggressive woman wants a man to demand,
F08 1500  7    not knuckle under. "When the husband becomes passive
F08 1510  3    in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr. Linden
F08 1520  2    says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often
F08 1520 11    she fails to gain sexual satisfaction".
F08 1530  6       One such wife, Dr. Linden says, became disgusted
F08 1540  5    with her weak husband and flurried through a series
F08 1550  3    of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger
F08 1560  1    man. But her personality was such that each affair
F08 1560 10    lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered
F08 1570  7    and reduced to passivity. Then the wife bed-hopped
F08 1580  4    to the next on the list.
F08 1580 10       In some cases, however, domination of the sex act
F08 1590  6    by one partner can be temporary, triggered by a passing
F08 1600  4    but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting
F08 1610  1    a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive
F08 1610 11    in bed- the one place he can still be champion. If
F08 1620 10    his on-the-job problems work out, he may return to
F08 1630  6    his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness
F08 1640  1    will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she
F08 1640 13    feels age creeping up.
F08 1650  4       On the other hand, a husband who always has been
F08 1660  2    vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive-
F08 1660  9    asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his
F08 1670  7    wife still finds him desirable. Or a wife may make
F08 1680  6    sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed,
F08 1690  3    simply because she needs her ego lifted.
F08 1690 10       In any case, Dr. Calderone remarks, such problems
F08 1700  6    are a couple's own affair, and can't always be measured
F08 1710  6    by a general yardstick. "As long as the couple is in
F08 1720  6    agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little
F08 1730  1    difference if one or the other dominates", Dr. Calderone
F08 1730 10    declares. "The important point is that both be satisfied
F08 1740  9    with the adjustment".
F08 1750  1       Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination
F08 1760  1    by one or the other partner exists for longer than
F08 1760 11    a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage.
F08 1770  8    And just as domination today often begins with the
F08 1780  4    wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.
F08 1790  1       "To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments
F08 1790 10    Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband
F08 1800  8    must take some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically,
F08 1810  9    by becoming more selfish. He must become more expressive
F08 1820  7    of his own desires, more demanding and less 'understanding'".
F08 1830  4       Too many husbands, Dr. Schillinger continues, worry
F08 1840  4    about "how well they're doing", and fear that their
F08 1850  5    success depends on some trick or technique of sexual
F08 1860  1    play.
