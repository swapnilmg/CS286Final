A07 0010  1       Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic
A07 0010  7    district leaders and some county leaders at reports
A07 0020  7    that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term
A07 0030  6    with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running
A07 0040  3    mates.
A07 0040  4       At the same time reaction among anti-organization
A07 0050  1    Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the
A07 0050 10    Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable.
A07 0060  6       Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program
A07 0070  6    an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within
A07 0080  3    the Democratic party that has been going on for the
A07 0090  1    last three years.
A07 0090  4       The resentment among Democratic organization leaders
A07 0100  2    to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly
A07 0100 10    at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates
A07 0110 10    without consulting the leaders. Some viewed this attempt
A07 0120  7    as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger
A07 0130  5    than the party.
A07 0130  8    #OPPOSITION REPORTED#
A07 0140  1    Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported
A07 0140  9    trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of
A07 0150  7    Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination
A07 0160  6    in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary.
A07 0170  2       These contend there is a serious question as to
A07 0170 11    whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic
A07 0180  9    rank and file in the city. Their view is that last-minute
A07 0190 10    changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic
A07 0200  6    ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance
A07 0210  3    as Mayor.
A07 0210  5       In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary
A07 0220  5    slate, Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with
A07 0230  2    Representative Charles A. Buckley, the Bronx Democratic
A07 0240  1    leader, and with Joseph T. Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic
A07 0250  1    leader.
A07 0250  2    #MAYOR VISITS BUCKLEY#
A07 0250  5    As usual, he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine
A07 0260  5    G. De Sapio, the Manhattan leader. He is publicly on
A07 0270  4    record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced
A07 0280  1    for the good of the party.
A07 0280  7       Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the
A07 0290  4    Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.
A07 0300  1    Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to
A07 0300 10    the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices
A07 0310  6    for running mates without a struggle.
A07 0320  4       In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington,
A07 0330  3    the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent
A07 0340  1    to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa, who lives
A07 0340  9    in the Bronx, from this year's ticket. But Mr. Buckley
A07 0350  9    seems to have assumed he would be given the right to
A07 0360  9    pick Mr. Gerosa's successor.
A07 0370  1    #SCREVANE AND BEAME HAILED#
A07 0370  5    The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters
A07 0380  3    yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had
A07 0390  2    decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane, who lives in
A07 0390 12    Queens, to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the
A07 0400  9    candidate for President of the City Council and Mr.
A07 0410  7    Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to replace Mr. Gerosa
A07 0420  4    as the candidate for Controller.
A07 0420  9       The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties
A07 0430  9    Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx. After
A07 0440  7    his speech, reporters asked him about the report of
A07 0450  6    his political intentions, published in yesterday's
A07 0460  1    New York Times. The Mayor said:
A07 0460  7       "It didn't come from me. But as I have said before,
A07 0470 10    if I announce my candidacy, I will have something definite
A07 0480  6    to say about running mates".
A07 0490  1    _BOSTON, JUNE 16_
A07 0490  4       - A wave of public resentment against corruption
A07 0500  1    in government is rising in Massachusetts.
A07 0500  7       There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion
A07 0510  7    toward politics. The taxi driver taking the visitor
A07 0520  4    from the airport remarks that politicians in the state
A07 0530  1    are "all the same".
A07 0530  5       "It's 'See Joe, see Jim'", he says. "The hand is
A07 0540  6    out".
A07 0540  7       A political scientist writes of the growth of "alienated
A07 0550  6    voters", who "believe that voting is useless because
A07 0560  4    politicians or those who influence politicians are
A07 0570  1    corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control. ... These
A07 0570  9    voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy,
A07 0580  7    the object of which is to plunder them".
A07 0590  3       Corruption is hardly a recent development in the
A07 0600  2    city and state that were widely identified as the locale
A07 0600 12    of Edwin O'Connor's novel, "The Last Hurrah". But there
A07 0610  8    are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
A07 0620  8       A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused
A07 0630  6    the public within the last year. Graft in the construction
A07 0640  5    of highways and other public works has brought on state
A07 0650  3    and Federal investigations. And the election of President
A07 0660  1    Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical
A07 0660  9    climate of his home state.
A07 0670  4       A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape
A07 0680  2    the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the
A07 0680 11    norm in Massachusetts public life. Day after day some
A07 0690  7    new episode is reported.
A07 0700  1       The state Public Works Department is accused of
A07 0700  9    having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a
A07 0710  9    state judge on his waterfront property. An assistant
A07 0720  4    attorney general is directed to investigate.
A07 0730  1    _WASHINGTON, JUNE 18_
A07 0730  4       - Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply
A07 0740  2    contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
A07 0740  8       In the Senate, several bills are expected to pass
A07 0750  8    without any major conflict or opposition. In the House,
A07 0760  6    the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make
A07 0770  4    another major stand in opposition to the Administration's
A07 0780  1    housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an
A07 0780 10    attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill.
A07 0790  8       The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee.
A07 0800  6    It is expected to be reported out Tuesday, but this
A07 0810  3    is a little uncertain.
A07 0810  7       The panel's action depends on the return of Representative
A07 0820  6    James W. Trimble, Democrat of Arkansas, who has been
A07 0830  6    siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules
A07 0840  4    Committee in moving bills to the floor. Mr. Trimble
A07 0850  1    has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.
A07 0850 11    #LEADERSHIP IS HOPEFUL#
A07 0860  3    The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition
A07 0870  2    by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative
A07 0880  1    Republicans. The Democratic leadership, however, hopes
A07 0880  7    to pass it sometime this week.
A07 0890  4       The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed last
A07 0900  2    Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages
A07 0900 11    at low down-payments for moderate-income families.
A07 0910  7    It also provides for funds to clear slums and help
A07 0920  6    colleges build dormitories.
A07 0920  9       The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled
A07 0930  7    in the Rules Committee, where two Northern Democratic
A07 0940  5    members who usually vote with the Administration are
A07 0950  3    balking because of the religious controversy. They
A07 0960  1    are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill
A07 0960 11    Jr. of Massachusetts.
A07 0970  3    #THREE GROUPS TO MEET#
A07 0970  7    What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress
A07 0980  8    on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act
A07 0990  4    of 1958. This would provide for long-term Federal loans
A07 1000  3    for construction of parochial and other private-school
A07 1010  1    facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.
A07 1020  1       Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote
A07 1020 11    on the public-school measure until the defense education
A07 1030  8    bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee.
A07 1050  1       About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned
A07 1050  9    to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious
A07 1060  8    groups, according to an official of the corps.
A07 1070  4       In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted
A07 1080  1    for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent
A07 1080  8    through universities and private voluntary agencies.
A07 1090  6       Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at
A07 1100  7    the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon Boyce, director
A07 1110  3    of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in a
A07 1120  2    Washington interview. Six of these were proposed by
A07 1120 10    religious groups. They will be for teaching, agriculture
A07 1130  7    and community development in Southeast Asia, Africa,
A07 1140  5    the Middle East and Latin America.
A07 1150  1    #QUESTION RAISED#
A07 1150  3    Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed
A07 1160  1    that this development has raised the question whether
A07 1160  9    the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for
A07 1170  9    church and state over methods, means and goals.
A07 1180  5       There are a number of ways this could happen, the
A07 1190  3    churchmen pointed out, and here is an example:
A07 1200  1       Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered
A07 1200  9    when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate
A07 1210 10    had been doubled. When he protested, the hotel owner
A07 1220  4    said:
A07 1220  5       "Why do you worry? The U. S. Government is paying
A07 1225  6    for it. The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas
A07 1230  6    workers".
A07 1230  7    #MISSIONARY EXPLAINS#
A07 1240  2    "I don't work for the Government", the American said.
A07 1250  2    "I'm a missionary".
A07 1250  5       The hotel owner shrugged. "Same thing", he said.
A07 1260  5       And then, some churchmen remarked, there is a more
A07 1270  5    classical church-state problem:
A07 1270  9       Can religious agencies use Government funds and
A07 1280  6    Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve
A07 1290  5    the constitutional requirement on separation of church
A07 1300  3    and state?
A07 1300  5       R. Sargent Shriver Jr., director of the corps, is
A07 1310  5    certain that they can. No religious group, he declared
A07 1320  2    in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless
A07 1320 11    it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
A07 1340  1    _MOSCOW, JUNE 18_
A07 1340  4       - At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno
A07 1350  2    of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets
A07 1360  1    and said, beaming: "Look, he took everything I had"!
A07 1370  1       Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood
A07 1370  9    of the successful banker. Indonesia is one of the twenty
A07 1380  8    under-developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin
A07 1390  5    America that are receiving Soviet aid.
A07 1400  1       The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist
A07 1400 10    bloc are rapidly expanding their economic, technical
A07 1410  5    and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
A07 1420  4       The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000
A07 1430  3    in economic aid alone last year, according to Western
A07 1440  1    estimates. This was the biggest annual outlay since
A07 1440  9    the Communist program for the under-developed countries
A07 1450  7    made its modest beginning in 1954. In 1960 more than
A07 1460  7    6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries.
A07 1480  1    _UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., JUNE 18_
A07 1480  7       - A committee of experts has recommended that a
A07 1490  4    country's population be considered in the distribution
A07 1500  1    of professional posts at the United Nations. This was
A07 1500 10    disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified
A07 1510  8    efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role
A07 1520  7    in the staff and operation of the United Nations.
A07 1530  2       One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium
A07 1540  1    on population instead of economic strength, as in the
A07 1540 10    past, would be to take jobs from European nations and
A07 1550  9    give more to such countries as India. India is the
A07 1560  6    most populous United Nations member with more than
A07 1570  2    400,000,000 inhabitants.
A07 1570  4       The new formula for filling staff positions in the
A07 1580  5    Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made
A07 1590  2    by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
A07 1590 13    The report was completed after nearly eighteen months
A07 1600  7    of work on the question of the organization of the
A07 1610  5    United Nations.
A07 1610  7    #FORMULA IS DUE THIS WEEK#
A07 1620  1    The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
A07 1620  8    Questions is expected to receive the report this week.
A07 1630  9    The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines:
A07 1640  6    _@_
A07 1640  7       Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would
A07 1650  5    get two professional posts, such as political affairs
A07 1660  3    officer, a department head or an economist, to start.
A07 1670  1    #@#
A07 1670  2    Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000
A07 1670 11    people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or
A07 1680  9    a maximum of fifteen posts.
A07 1690  1    #@#
A07 1690  2    Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would
A07 1700  1    get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000
A07 1700  9    people up to an unspecified cut-off point.
A07 1720  1    _GENEVA, JUNE 18_
A07 1720  4       - The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin
A07 1730  1    negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government
A07 1730  8    that would unite the war-ridden kingdom.
A07 1740  6       The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum,
A07 1750  5    Premier of the pro-Western royal Government; Prince
A07 1760  2    Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists
A07 1770  1    and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and
A07 1770 10    Prince Souphanouvong, head of the pro-Communist Pathet
A07 1780  7    Lao forces. The latter two are half-brothers.
A07 1785  5       Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western
A07 1790  8    delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth
A07 1800  4    plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on
A07 1810  2    the future of Laos. An agreement among the Princes
A07 1810 11    on a coalition government would ease their task, diplomats
A07 1820  7    conceded. But no one was overly optimistic.
A07 1830  5    #TACTICS STUDIED IN GENEVA#
A07 1830  9    W. Averell Harriman of the United States, Malcolm MacDonald
A07 1840  8    of Britain, Maurice Couve de Murville, France's Foreign
A07 1860  7    Minister, and Howard C. Green, Canada's Minister of
A07 1870  6    External Affairs, concluded, meanwhile, a round of
A07 1880  5    consultations here on future tactics in the conference.
A07 1890  2    The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing
A07 1890 12    week.
A07 1900  1       Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter,
A07 1910  1    read the Princes' statement. They had a two-hour luncheon
A07 1910 11    together in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding
A07 1920  7    and relaxation", she said.
A07 1930  2       The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda
A07 1930 11    for their talks, which are to last three days.
A07 1940  9       The Princess said it was too early to say what would
A07 1950  9    be decided if no agreement was reached after three
A07 1960  3    days.
A07 1960  4    #TO DEAL WITH PRINCIPLES#
A07 1960  8    The meetings in Zurich, the statement said, would deal
A07 1970  7    only with principles that would guide the three factors
A07 1980  5    in their search for a coalition Government.
