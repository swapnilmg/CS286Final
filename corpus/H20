H20 0010  1    _WILDLIFE HABITAT RESOURCES_
H20 0010  4       In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation
H20 0020  2    visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were
H20 0020 10    for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing. Hunter
H20 0030  9    and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times
H20 0040  7    faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing
H20 0050  5    licenses. This use is expected to increase to about
H20 0060  2    50 million visits by 1972. The long-range objective
H20 0060 11    of habitat management is to make it fully productive
H20 0070  8    so as to support fish and game populations to contribute
H20 0080  5    to the need for public use and enjoyment.
H20 0090  1       The wildlife habitat management proposals for the
H20 0090  8    10-year period are:
H20 0100  2    _1._
H20 0100  3       Revise and complete wildlife habitat management
H20 0110  1    and improvement plans for all administrative units,
H20 0110  8    assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat
H20 0120  4    management and other resources.
H20 0130  1    _2._
H20 0130  1       Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources
H20 0130  7    in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with
H20 0140  7    the States in which National Forests and Grasslands
H20 0150  4    are located, as a basis for orderly development of
H20 0160  2    wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs,
H20 0160  8    including (a) big-game, gamebird, and small-game habitat
H20 0170  9    surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres
H20 0180  6    of National Forests and Grasslands, (b) fishery habitat
H20 0190  4    surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National
H20 0200  3    Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of
H20 0200 12    lakes and impoundments, and (c) participation in planning,
H20 0210  8    inspection, and control phases of all habitat improvement,
H20 0220  7    land- and water-use projects conducted on National
H20 0230  4    Forest lands by States, other Federal agencies, and
H20 0240  2    private groups to assure that projects will benefit
H20 0240 10    wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values.
H20 0250  9    _3._
H20 0250 10       Improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key
H20 0260  9    wildlife areas.
H20 0260 11    _4._
H20 0260 12       Develop wildlife openings, food patches, and game
H20 0270  7    ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled
H20 0280  5    burning on 400,000 acres.
H20 0280  9    _5._
H20 0280 10       Improve 7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000
H20 0290  8    acres of lakes by stabilizing banks, planting streamside
H20 0300  4    cover, and constructing channel improvements.
H20 0310  1    #PROTECTION#
H20 0310  2    The total adverse impact of disease, insects, fire,
H20 0320  2    weather, destructive animals, and other forces on the
H20 0320 10    uses and values of forest resources is not generally
H20 0330  8    recognized. They kill and destroy, retard or prevent
H20 0340  5    reproduction and growth, impair and damage values,
H20 0350  2    and disrupt uses.
H20 0350  5       The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage
H20 0360  3    by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952
H20 0370  1    was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet. If
H20 0370 11    it were not for the effect of destructive agencies,
H20 0380  5    sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great
H20 0390  4    as the 47 billion board feet in 1952. About 45 percent
H20 0400  1    of the loss in growth was attributable to disease,
H20 0400 10    20 percent to insects, 17 percent to fire, and 18 percent
H20 0410  9    to weather, animals, and various other causes.
H20 0420  4       These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse
H20 0430  2    effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting
H20 0430 10    waterflows, and upon the other renewable forest resources.
H20 0440  8       The long-range objective is to hold the damage from
H20 0450  8    destructive agencies below the level which would seriously
H20 0460  6    interfere with intensive management of the National
H20 0470  4    Forest System under principles of multiple use and
H20 0480  1    high-level sustained yield of products and services.
H20 0480  9    This can be accomplished substantially by a continued
H20 0490  5    trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire
H20 0500  5    control and more resources to cope with critical fire
H20 0510  2    periods, and a more intensive application of a program
H20 0510 11    of prevention, detection, and control of insect and
H20 0520  7    disease infestations. In addition to direct protection
H20 0530  5    measures, more intensive management of timber resources
H20 0540  3    will assist in reduction of losses from insects and
H20 0550  1    disease.
H20 0550  2    _PROTECTION FROM INSECTS AND DISEASE_
H20 0550  7       In the 10-year period, it is proposed that insect
H20 0560  6    and disease control on the National Forest System be
H20 0570  3    stepped up to a level of prevention, detection, and
H20 0580  1    control of insect and disease infestations that will
H20 0580  9    substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations
H20 0590  6    toward the end of the initial period. This will require
H20 0600  5    about a 40 percent increase over the present level
H20 0610  2    of protection. The work will consist of:
H20 0610  9    _1._
H20 0610 10       Intensification of present activities through (a)
H20 0620  6    quicker, more extensive, and more thorough surveys
H20 0630  4    to detect incipient outbreaks; (b) more reliable evaluation
H20 0640  2    of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread
H20 0650  1    damage; (c) quicker and more effective control action
H20 0650  9    in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic.
H20 0660  8    The initial suppression activities would cover about
H20 0670  5    twice the acreage currently being treated.
H20 0680  1    _2._
H20 0680  2       Continuation of present blister rust control work
H20 0680  9    plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now
H20 0690  8    protected but which should be managed for white pine
H20 0700  6    production. The objective is to achieve sufficient
H20 0710  1    effectiveness of control on all of the area now under
H20 0710 11    treatment plus the additional acres so that after the
H20 0720  9    initial period only maintenance control will be needed.
H20 0730  5    _3._
H20 0730  6       Initiating a program to control dwarfmistletoe on
H20 0740  3    several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands
H20 0750  2    of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites.
H20 0760  1    _4._
H20 0760  1       Coordination of pest control objectives with timber
H20 0760  8    management activities to reduce losses.
H20 0770  4    _PROTECTION FROM FIRE_
H20 0770  7       It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands,
H20 0790  6    all critical watersheds, and other lands in the National
H20 0800  6    Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use
H20 0810  3    will be given protection from fire adequate to meet
H20 0810 12    the fire situation in the worst years and under serious
H20 0820 10    peak loads. This will include 125 million acres compared
H20 0830  7    with 23 million acres now receiving such protection.
H20 0840  3    An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser
H20 0850  3    degree of protection but adequate to meet the average
H20 0850 12    fire situation.
H20 0860  1       Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls
H20 0860  9    for:
H20 0870  1    _1._
H20 0870  2       Expansion, modernization, and development of fire
H20 0870  8    control to a proficiency and strength of force which
H20 0880  9    will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress
H20 0890  6    fires before they spread beyond permitted standards.
H20 0900  2    This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present
H20 0910  1    level of preventive effort, detection, skilled fire-fighting
H20 0910  9    crews, and equipment use. This will include a stepped-up
H20 0920 10    program of training and development of personnel.
H20 0930  5    _2._
H20 0930  6       Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being
H20 0940  4    developed for prevention, for suppression of fires
H20 0950  1    while small, and for stopping large fires while running
H20 0950 10    and burning intensely.
H20 0960  2    _3._
H20 0960  3       Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize
H20 0970  1    the chances of large fires developing and spreading
H20 0970  9    to high-value areas. This work will cover the most
H20 0980  8    serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment,
H20 0990  4    and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly
H20 1000  1    hazardous debris concentration, felling snags on 350,000
H20 1000  8    acres of high lightning-occurrence areas, prescribed
H20 1010  6    burning on 3.5 million acres, removing roadside fuel
H20 1020  4    on 39,000 acres, and clearing and maintaining 11,000
H20 1030  2    miles of firebreaks.
H20 1030  5    _PROTECTION FROM OTHER DAMAGE_
H20 1030  9       Rodent control work for the 10-year period will
H20 1040  9    be aimed at control of the most serious infestations
H20 1050  5    of harmful rodents, such as porcupines and mice, on
H20 1060  4    high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands.
H20 1060 12    These areas comprise about half of the total area of
H20 1070 10    rodent infestation on the National Forests. Approximately
H20 1080  6    1.8 million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres
H20 1090  5    of timberlands would be treated in this period. Control
H20 1100  2    would be limited to those rodents for which economical
H20 1100 11    means of control are known.
H20 1110  5    #ROADS AND TRAILS#
H20 1110  8    The transportation system which serves the National
H20 1120  6    Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and
H20 1130  4    trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions.
H20 1140  1    This system is divided into a forest highway system,
H20 1140 10    administered by the Secretary of Commerce, and a forest
H20 1150  8    development road and trail system, administered by
H20 1160  3    the Secretary of Agriculture. Both of these systems
H20 1170  2    are essential for the production, development, and
H20 1170  9    use of the National Forests.
H20 1190  2       In the forest highway system, there are now 24,400
H20 1200  2    miles of public roads. These are mostly through highways
H20 1200 11    that carry traffic going from one destination to another.
H20 1210  9    Because administration of the forest highway system
H20 1220  6    is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with
H20 1230  4    maintenance provided by the States and counties, this
H20 1240  2    Development Program for the National Forests does not
H20 1240 10    include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the
H20 1250  9    forest highway system nor to construct the additions
H20 1260  6    to its that are needed. It is estimated that about
H20 1270  3    70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be
H20 1270 11    needed to fully serve the National Forests.
H20 1280  7       In the forest development road and trail system,
H20 1290  5    there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles
H20 1300  3    of supplemental foot and horse trails. These roads
H20 1300 11    are largely of less than highway standards, and usually
H20 1310  9    carry traffic which is related to use of the National
H20 1320  8    Forests. Construction and maintenance of this system
H20 1330  4    is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture.
H20 1340  1    It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest
H20 1340 10    development roads, and 80,000 miles of trails, constitute
H20 1350  8    the system that will eventually be needed to obtain
H20 1360  5    the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood,
H20 1370  3    water, forage, and wildlife and recreation resources
H20 1370 10    of the National Forests on a continuing basis.
H20 1380  7       The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily
H20 1390  6    for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection.
H20 1400  4    It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service
H20 1410  2    to these important resources and watersheds.
H20 1410  8       The presence or lack of access by road or trail
H20 1420  9    has a direct and controlling influence on all phases
H20 1430  5    of forest management and utilization such as:
H20 1440  1    _(A)_
H20 1440  2       the protection of forage, timber, and wildlife resources
H20 1450  1    from fire, insects, and disease;
H20 1450  6    _(B)_
H20 1450  7       the balanced use of recreation, hunting, and fishing
H20 1460  4    areas;
H20 1460  5    _(C)_
H20 1460  6       the volume of timber that can be marketed, especially
H20 1470  5    for small sales and the support of dependent communities
H20 1480  2    and small business enterprises;
H20 1480  6    _(D)_
H20 1480  7       the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber
H20 1490  9    stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses
H20 1500  5    resulting from fire, windstorm, insects, and disease;
H20 1510  3    _(E)_
H20 1510  4       the protection of watershed lands from erosion and
H20 1520  2    overgrazing by animals.
H20 1520  5       The existence of road systems permits an intensity
H20 1530  4    of management and use for all National Forest purposes
H20 1540  1    that is not otherwise possible. Furthermore, roads
H20 1540  8    that give access to National Forest timber are investments
H20 1550  8    which pay their own way over a period of years. Use
H20 1560  8    of these roads by the public results in substantial
H20 1570  3    benefits to the localities the roads serve.
H20 1570 10       The long-range objective of this Department is to
H20 1580  9    provide and maintain a system of forest development
H20 1590  6    roads and trails which will adequately service the
H20 1600  3    National Forest System at the levels needed to meet
H20 1600 12    expected needs and optimum production of products and
H20 1610  8    services. For the year 2000 this means servicing (a)
H20 1620  7    the protection requirements of a watershed producing
H20 1630  2    at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year,
H20 1630 12    (b) recreation and wildlife resources used each year
H20 1640  8    by 635 million visitors, (c) a timber resource supporting
H20 1650  6    an annual cut of 21 billion board feet, and (d) 60
H20 1660  5    million acres of rangelands.
H20 1660  9       Service at these levels of production and utilization
H20 1670  6    will eventually require the construction of about 379,900
H20 1680  5    miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails, along
H20 1690  3    with the reconstruction to higher standards of about
H20 1690 11    105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails.
H20 1700  9    About 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced
H20 1710  7    in service by the construction of new roads. About
H20 1720  4    80 percent of these long-range requirements should
H20 1720 12    be met by the year 2000.
H20 1730  6       Program proposals for forest development roads and
H20 1740  3    trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows:
H20 1750  1    _1._
H20 1750  2       Complete the construction and reconstruction of
H20 1750  8    about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000
H20 1760  8    miles of trails. This constitutes about 17 percent
H20 1770  4    of the long-range requirements for these facilities.
H20 1780  1       Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work
H20 1780 10    on roads for access to timber which are planned for
H20 1790 10    this period will be constructed by purchasers of National
H20 1800  5    Forest timber, but paid for by the Government through
H20 1810  4    adjustment of stumpage prices.
H20 1810  8    _2._
H20 1810  9       Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900
H20 1820  8    miles of existing access roads and trails and on the
H20 1830  7    new roads and trails constructed during the period.
H20 1840  3    #LAND ADJUSTMENT, LAND PURCHASE, LAND USE#
H20 1840  9    Within the units in the National Forest System the
H20 1850  8    pattern of land ownership is quite irregular. In some
H20 1860  6    units, National Forest ownership is well blocked together.
H20 1870  3    In many others, the previous patenting of land under
H20 1880  2    the public land laws, or the way in which land was
H20 1880 13    available for purchase, resulted in a scattered pattern
H20 1890  7    of ownership.
H20 1890  9       Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and
H20 1900  7    National Grasslands, there are about 40,000,000 acres
H20 1910  6    in non-Federal ownership. One consequence is the occurrence
H20 1920  4    of occasional conflicts because private owners of some
H20 1930  3    inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring
H20 1940  1    National Forest or other Federal land, or because such
H20 1940 10    ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible
H20 1950  8    with use for the public of neighboring National Forest
H20 1960  5    land. Some privately held inholdings are a source of
H20 1970  5    direct damage to these Federal lands. And some, which
H20 1980  1    are suitable for tree growing and for other National
H20 1980 10    Forest purposes, are unmanaged or in need of expensive
H20 1990  8    rehabilitation, and are contributing nothing to the
H20 2000  4    economy; there are no reasonable prospects that these
H20 2010  3    conditions will be corrected or changed. Lands in this
H20 2010 12    last category are situated largely in the mountainous
H20 2020  8    portions of the Eastern States.
H20 2030  2       The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation
H20 2040  1    of ownership through use of land exchange authority
H20 2040  9    and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings
H20 2050  8    which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest
H20 2060  5    programs such as recreation development, or which are
H20 2070  4    a source of damage to lands in National Forests and
H20 2080  2    National Grasslands.
