J05 0010  1    Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at
J05 0010  9    a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive,
J05 0020  6    and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of
J05 0030  5    soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates
J05 0040  1    and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and
J05 0040  8    exploited.
J05 0050  1       The market today for detergent builders is quite
J05 0050  9    diverse. The best known field of application for builders
J05 0060  7    is in heavy-duty, spray-dried detergent formulations
J05 0070  3    for household use. These widely advertised products,
J05 0080  2    which are used primarily for washing clothes, are based
J05 0080 11    on high-sudsing, synthetic organic actives (sodium
J05 0090  5    alkylbenzenesulfonates) and contain up to 50% by weight
J05 0100  8    of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium
J05 0110  3    tripolyphosphate
J05 0110  4    and tetrasodium pyrophosphate. In the household market,
J05 0120  3    there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based
J05 0130  2    on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate
J05 0130 12    builder; light-duty synthetic detergents with much
J05 0140  7    less builder; and the dwindling built-soap powders
J05 0150  5    as well as soap flakes and granules, none of which
J05 0160  3    are now nationally advertised. A well-publicized entrant
J05 0170  1    which has achieved success only recently is the built
J05 0170 10    liquid detergent, with which the major problem today
J05 0180  7    is incorporation of builder and active into a small
J05 0190  5    volume using a sufficiently high builder/active ratio.
J05 0200  2       Hard-surface cleaning in household application is
J05 0210  1    represented by two classes of alkaline products: (1)
J05 0210  9    the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers,
J05 0220  6    and (2) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls
J05 0230  5    and woodwork. The better quality products in both of
J05 0240  3    these lines contain phosphate builders. In addition,
J05 0240 10    many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and
J05 0250  9    woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate,
J05 0260  4    which is still the major ingredient of a number of
J05 0270  4    such products. Many scouring powders now also contain
J05 0270 12    phosphates. These hard-surface cleaners are discussed
J05 0280  7    in Chapter 28.
J05 0290  1    #THE CLEANING PROCESS#
J05 0290  3    Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of
J05 0300  4    surfaces. Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium,
J05 0300 11    a solid substrate, soil to be removed, and the detergent
J05 0310  9    or surface-active material. An oversimplified differentiation
J05 0320  5    between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the
J05 0330  5    magnitude and kind of surface involved. One gram of
J05 0340  3    cotton has been found to have a specific surface area
J05 0340 13    of **f. In contrast, a metal coupon **f in size would
J05 0350 10    have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less. Even
J05 0360  7    here there is room for some variation, for metal surfaces
J05 0370  4    vary in smoothness, absorptive capacity, and chemical
J05 0380  1    reactivity. Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in
J05 0380  9    a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences
J05 0390  6    in soil removal, depending upon surface roughness.
J05 0400  4    There are considerable differences between the requirements
J05 0410  3    for textile and hard-surface cleaning. Exclusive of
J05 0420  2    esthetic values, such as high- or low-foam level, perfume
J05 0420 13    content, etc., the requirements for the organic active
J05 0430  8    used in washing textiles are high. No matter how they
J05 0440  7    are formulated, a large number of organic actives are
J05 0450  3    simply not suitable for this application, since they
J05 0460  1    do not give adequate soil removal. This is best demonstrated
J05 0460 11    by practical washing tests in which cloth articles
J05 0470  7    are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation.
J05 0480  5    A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and
J05 0490  3    white after many washings; whereas, with a poor formulation,
J05 0500  1    the clothes exhibit a build-up of "tattle-tale grey"
J05 0500 11    and dirty spots- sometimes with bad results even after
J05 0510  7    the first wash. Since practical washing procedures
J05 0520  4    are both lengthy and expensive, a number of laboratory
J05 0530  3    tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation
J05 0540  1    of detergents. Harris has indicated that two devices,
J05 0540  9    the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely
J05 0550  8    used for rapid detergent testing, and he has listed
J05 0560  6    the commercially available standard soiled fabrics.
J05 0570  2    Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in
J05 0570 10    general use. The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing
J05 0580  9    of detergent formulations are made in such a way that
J05 0590  8    only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent
J05 0600  5    formulation in a single wash. In this way, numerical
J05 0610  2    values for the relative efficacy of various detergent
J05 0610 10    formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance
J05 0620  8    (whiteness) of the cloth swatches before and after
J05 0630  6    washing. Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing
J05 0640  3    clean swatches with the dirty ones. As is the case
J05 0640 13    with the surface-active agent, the requirements for
J05 0650  8    builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing
J05 0660  5    textiles are also high. Large numbers of potential
J05 0670  3    builders have been investigated, but none have been
J05 0680  1    found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over
J05 0680 10    the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice.
J05 0690  7       The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly
J05 0700  5    as complex. In hard-surface cleaning, the inorganic
J05 0710  2    salts are more important than the organic active. Indeed,
J05 0720  1    when the proper inorganic constituents are employed,
J05 0720  8    practically any wetting or surface-active agent will
J05 0730  7    do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient
J05 0740  3    amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation. Hydroxides,
J05 0750  1    orthophosphates, borates, carbonates, and silicates
J05 0750  6    are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface
J05 0760  6    cleaners. In addition, the polyphosphates are also
J05 0770  4    used, probably acting more as peptizing agents than
J05 0780  2    anything else. The importance of the inorganic constituents
J05 0780 10    in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number
J05 0790 10    of papers.
J05 0790 12    #PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY OF WASHING#
J05 0800  4    Although there is no question but that the process
J05 0810  5    of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which
J05 0820  2    are related together in an extremely complicated way
J05 0820 10    and that these phenomena and their interrelations are
J05 0830  7    not well understood at the present, this section attempts
J05 0840  5    to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical
J05 0850  4    chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces.
J05 0860  1    The purpose of washing is, obviously, to remove soils
J05 0860 10    which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories
J05 0870  7    given below:
J05 0880  1    _1._
J05 0880  1       Dirt, which is here defined as particulate material
J05 0880  9    which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely
J05 0890  7    finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties.
J05 0900  3    _2._
J05 0900  4       Greasy soils, which are typified by hydrocarbons
J05 0910  2    and fats (esters of glycerol with long-chain organic
J05 0910 11    acids).
J05 0920  1    _3._
J05 0920  2       Stains, which include the wide variety of nonparticulate
J05 0930  1    materials which give color even when present in very
J05 0930 10    low concentration on the soiled object.
J05 0940  5    _4._
J05 0940  6       Miscellaneous soils, which primarily include sticky
J05 0950  3    substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to
J05 0950 10    leave a residue.
J05 0960  3       The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held
J05 0970  2    by surface irregularities to some extent. However,
J05 0970  9    a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between
J05 0980  8    surfaces that goes under the name of van der Waal's
J05 0990  7    forces. This is a theoretically complicated dipole
J05 1000  2    interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged
J05 1000  9    particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged
J05 1010  7    particles, or to stick to an uncharged surface. Obviously,
J05 1020  6    if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign
J05 1030  4    or, if one kind is charged and the other kind is not,
J05 1040  2    the attraction will be intensified and the tendency
J05 1040 10    to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced. Likewise,
J05 1050  6    a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged
J05 1060  6    surface and vice versa, and a charged particle will
J05 1070  2    be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting
J05 1070 10    an opposite charge. In addition, dirt particles can
J05 1080  7    be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances
J05 1090  4    or by the surface tension of liquids, including liquid
J05 1100  2    greases.
J05 1100  3       Greases, stains, and miscellaneous soils are usually
J05 1110  3    sorbed onto the soiled surface. In most cases, these
J05 1110 12    soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action.
J05 1120  9    In an essentially static system, an oil cannot be replaced
J05 1130  8    by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions
J05 1140  4    of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active
J05 1150  1    agent.
J05 1150  2       The washing process whereby soils are removed consists
J05 1160  1    basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the
J05 1160  9    dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of
J05 1170  8    water which helps to float off the debris and acts,
J05 1180  5    to some extent, as a dissolving and solvating agent.
J05 1190  2    Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain
J05 1190 11    water; and natural waters, in addition, often contain
J05 1200  7    impurities such as calcium salts which can react with
J05 1210  6    soils to make them more difficult to remove. Therefore,
J05 1220  2    detergents are used. The detergent active is that substance
J05 1230  1    which primarily acts to remove greasy soils. The other
J05 1230 10    constituents in a built detergent assist in this and
J05 1240  9    in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic
J05 1250  4    sticky or dried soils.
J05 1250  8       As is well known, detergent actives belong to the
J05 1260  6    chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular
J05 1270  3    weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the
J05 1280  1    property of forming micelles in solution. Physicochemical
J05 1280  8    investigations of anionic surfactants, including the
J05 1290  6    soaps, have shown that there is little polymerization
J05 1300  4    or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain
J05 1310  3    region of concentration called the critical micelle
J05 1310 10    concentration. (1) Below the critical micelle concentration,
J05 1320  7    monomers and some dimers are present. (2) In the critical
J05 1330  8    micelle region, there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization
J05 1340  6    to give the micelles, which have a degree of polymerization
J05 1350  5    averaging around 60-80. (3) For anionics, these micelles
J05 1360  3    appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which
J05 1370  1    the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar
J05 1370 10    groups (the ionized ends) face outward towards the
J05 1380  6    aqueous continuous phase. Obviously hydrophobic (oleophilic)
J05 1390  2    substances such as greases, oils, or particles having
J05 1400  1    a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center
J05 1400 13    of a micelle than in the aqueous phase. Micelles can
J05 1410  8    imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic
J05 1420  4    substances so that the micelle volume may be increased
J05 1430  2    as much as approximately two-fold. Although the matter
J05 1430 11    has not been unequivocally demonstrated, the available
J05 1440  7    data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute
J05 1450  6    significantly to the detergency process.
J05 1460  1       Related to micelle formation is the technologically
J05 1460  8    important ability of detergent actives to congregate
J05 1470  7    at oil-water interfaces in such a manner that the polar
J05 1480  8    (or ionized) end of the molecule is directed towards
J05 1490  2    the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards
J05 1490 10    the oily phase. In the cleaning process, sorbed greasy
J05 1500  9    soils become coated in this manner with an oriented
J05 1510  7    film of surfactant. Then during washing, the greasy
J05 1520  3    soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets
J05 1530  1    can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass,
J05 1530  9    with the aid of mechanical action, and enter the aqueous
J05 1540  7    phase. Obviously, a substance which is permanently
J05 1550  4    or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the
J05 1560  2    soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively
J05 1560 11    push off the greasy soil.
J05 1570  4       Substances other than detergent actives also tend
J05 1580  2    to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces
J05 1580 11    of other contiguous condensed phases. This is particularly
J05 1590  7    true of highly charged ions, especially those ions
J05 1600  5    which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes. Whereas
J05 1610  2    the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly
J05 1620  1    sorbed at oil-water interfaces, the highly charged
J05 1620  9    ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between
J05 1630  5    water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure
J05 1640  4    (see Table 26-2 on p. 1678). Thus, for aqueous media,
J05 1650  2    we can think of the idealized organic active as an
J05 1650 12    oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent, and
J05 1660  7    of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic
J05 1670  5    surface-active agent.
J05 1670  8       From the equilibrium sorption data which are available,
J05 1680  6    it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions
J05 1690  4    would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt
J05 1700  3    (especially clay soils) so as to give it a greatly
J05 1700 13    increased negative charge. The charged particles then
J05 1710  7    repel each other and are also repelled from the charged
J05 1720  6    surface, which almost invariably bears a negative charge
J05 1730  4    under washing conditions. The negatively charged dirt
J05 1740  1    particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous
J05 1740 11    phase. This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the
J05 1750  8    demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency.
J05 1760  4    It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate
J05 1770  4    builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will
J05 1780  1    be discussed later (see pp. 1746-1748).
J05 1780  8       The crude picture of the detergency process thus
J05 1790  5    far developed can be represented as: **f The influence
J05 1800  3    of mechanical action on the particles of free soil
J05 1800 12    may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular
J05 1810 11    scale. Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against
J05 1820  7    flocculation. Cleaned cloth must be protected against
J05 1830  5    the redeposition of dispersed soil. It is evident that
J05 1840  3    the requirements imposed by these effects upon any
J05 1840 11    one detergent constituent acting alone are severe.
J05 1850  7       Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics
J05 1860  8    normally encountered in the washing process, it is
J05 1870  4    little wonder that the use of a number of detergent
J05 1880  1    constituents having "synergistic" properties has gained
J05 1880  7    widespread acceptance. In the over-all process, it
J05 1890  8    is difficult to assign a "pure" role to each constituent
J05 1900  6    of a built-detergent formulation; and, indeed, there
J05 1910  4    is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles
J05 1920  1    of the active, builder, antiredeposition agent, etc.
J05 1920  8    than there is to assign individual actions to each
J05 1930  8    of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial
J05 1940  5    organic active.
