H24 0010  1    If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax
H24 0010 12    Table, and later find you should have itemized your
H24 0020  8    deductions, you may do so by filing an amended return
H24 0030  5    within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund.
H24 0040  3    See You May Claim a Refund, Page 135. The same is true
H24 0050  3    if you have itemized your deductions and later decide
H24 0050 12    you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax
H24 0060  8    Table. The words amended return should be plainly written
H24 0070  6    across the top of such return.
H24 0080  1    _WHEN AND WHERE TO FILE_
H24 0080  6       April 15 is usually the final date for filing income
H24 0090  4    tax returns for most people because they use the calendar
H24 0100  1    year ending on December 31. If you use a fiscal year,
H24 0100 12    a year ending on the last day of any month other than
H24 0110 10    December, your return is due on or before the 15th
H24 0120  7    day of the 4th month after the close of your tax year.
H24 0130  3    _SATURDAY, SUNDAY, OR HOLIDAY._
H24 0130  7       If the last day (due date) for performing any act
H24 0140  6    for tax purposes, such as filing a return or making
H24 0150  4    a tax payment, etc., falls on Saturday, Sunday, or
H24 0160  2    a legal holiday, you may perform that act on the next
H24 0160 13    succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
H24 0170  8    legal holiday. Since April 15, 1962, is on Sunday your
H24 0180  6    return for the calendar year 1961 will be timely filed
H24 0190  3    if it is filed on or before Monday, April 16, 1962.
H24 0200  1       IF YOU MAIL A RETURN or tax payment, you must place
H24 0200 12    it in the mails in ample time to reach the district
H24 0210 11    director on or before the due date.
H24 0220  4    _DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX._
H24 0220  8       If you were required to file a declaration of estimated
H24 0230  7    tax for the calendar year 1961, it is not necessary
H24 0240  5    to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January
H24 0250  1    15, 1962, if you file your income tax return Form 1040,
H24 0250 12    and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961
H24 0260 10    by January 31, 1962. The filing of an original or amended
H24 0270  7    declaration, otherwise due on January 15, 1962, is
H24 0280  4    also waived, if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and
H24 0290  1    pay the full tax by January 31, 1962. Farmers, for
H24 0290 11    these purposes, have until February 15, 1962, to file
H24 0300  8    Form 1040 and pay the tax in full for the calendar
H24 0310  5    year 1961. Fiscal year taxpayers have until the last
H24 0320  2    day of the first month following the close of the fiscal
H24 0320 13    year (farmers until the 15th day of the 2d month).
H24 0330  9    See Chapter 38.
H24 0340  1       Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who
H24 0340  8    earn wages in the United States may be subject to withholding
H24 0350  9    of tax on their wages, the same as if they were citizens
H24 0360  8    of the United States. Their United States tax returns
H24 0370  5    are due April 16, 1962. However, if their United States
H24 0380  3    income is not subject to the withholding of tax on
H24 0380 13    wages, their returns are due June 15, 1962, if they
H24 0390 10    use a calendar year, or the 15th day of the 6th month
H24 0400  9    after the close of their fiscal year.
H24 0410  1    _NONRESIDENT ALIENS IN PUERTO RICO._
H24 0410  6       If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of
H24 0420  6    Puerto Rico, your return is also due June 15, 1962,
H24 0430  3    or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of
H24 0430 15    your fiscal year.
H24 0440  2       IF A TAXPAYER DIES, the executor, administrator,
H24 0450  1    or legal representative must file the final return
H24 0450  9    for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th
H24 0460 10    month following the close of the deceased taxpayer's
H24 0470  4    normal tax year. Suppose John Jones, who, for 1960,
H24 0480  3    filed on the basis of a calendar year, died June 20,
H24 0480 14    1961. His return for the period January 1 to June 20,
H24 0490 11    1961, is due April 16, 1962.
H24 0500  3       The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim
H24 0510  1    for refund of an overpayment of tax. In such a case,
H24 0510 12    Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return.
H24 0520  8    This form may be obtained from the local office of
H24 0530  6    your district director.
H24 0530  9       RETURNS OF ESTATES OR TRUSTS are due on or before
H24 0540 10    the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the
H24 0550  8    tax year.
H24 0560  1    _EXTENSIONS OF TIME FOR FILING._
H24 0560  2       Under unusual circumstances a resident individual
H24 0560  8    may be granted an extension of time to file a return.
H24 0570 10    You may apply for such an extension by filing Form
H24 0580  6    2688, Application For Extension Of Time To File, with
H24 0590  5    the District Director of Internal Revenue for your
H24 0600  3    district, or you may make your application in a letter.
H24 0600 13    Your application must include the following information:
H24 0610  7    (1) your reasons for requesting an extension, (2) whether
H24 0620  7    you filed timely income tax returns for the 3 preceding
H24 0630  6    years, and (3) whether you were required to file an
H24 0640  4    estimated return for the year, and if so whether you
H24 0640 14    did file and have paid the estimated tax payments on
H24 0650  9    or before the due dates. Any failure to file timely
H24 0660  6    returns or make estimated tax payments when due must
H24 0670  4    be fully explained. Extensions are not granted as a
H24 0670 13    matter of course, and the reasons for your request
H24 0680  9    must be substantial. If you are unable to sign the
H24 0690  7    request, because of illness or other good cause, another
H24 0700  3    person who stands in close personal or business relationship
H24 0710  1    to you may sign the request on your behalf, stating
H24 0710 11    the reason why you are unable to sign. You should make
H24 0720 10    any request for an extension early so that if it is
H24 0730  7    refused, your return may still be on time. See also
H24 0740  3    Interest on Unpaid Taxes, below.
H24 0750  1    _EXTENSIONS WHILE ABROAD._
H24 0750  2       Citizens of the United States who, on April 15,
H24 0750 11    are not in the United States or Puerto Rico, are allowed
H24 0760 10    an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return
H24 0770  9    for the preceding calendar year. An extension of 2
H24 0780  6    months beyond the regular due date for filing is also
H24 0790  3    available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal
H24 0790 11    year.
H24 0800  1    _ALASKA AND HAWAII._
H24 0800  3       Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also
H24 0810  1    allowed this extension of time for filing, but those
H24 0810 10    residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this
H24 0820  7    automatic extension.
H24 0830  1       Military or Naval Personnel on duty in Alaska or
H24 0830 10    outside the United States and Puerto Rico are also
H24 0840  9    allowed this automatic extension of time for filing
H24 0850  6    their returns.
H24 0850  8       You must attach a statement to your return, if you
H24 0860  8    take advantage of this automatic extension, showing
H24 0880  3    that you were in Alaska or were outside the United
H24 0890  1    States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date.
H24 0900  1    _INTEREST ON UNPAID TAXES._
H24 0900  4       Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid on
H24 0910  2    taxes that are not paid on or before their due date.
H24 0910 13    Such interest must be paid even though an extension
H24 0920  8    of time for filing is granted.
H24 0930  1    _WHEN PAYMENT IS DUE._
H24 0930  5       If your computation on Form 1040 or Form 1040A
H24 0940  3    shows you owe additional tax, it should be remitted
H24 0950  1    with your return unless you owe less than $1, in which
H24 0950 12    case it is forgiven. If payment is by cash, you should
H24 0960  8    ask for a receipt. If you file Form 1040A and the
H24 0970  5    District Director computes your tax, you will be sent
H24 0980  4    a bill if additional tax is due. This bill should be
H24 0980 15    paid within 30 days.
H24 0990  4    _PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER._
H24 0990 10       Whether the check is certified or uncertified, the
H24 1000  7    tax is not paid until the check is paid. If the check
H24 1010  6    is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline
H24 1020  2    elapses, additions to the tax may be incurred. Furthermore,
H24 1030  1    a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties.
H24 1030 11    All checks and money orders should be made payable
H24 1040  8    to Internal Revenue Service.
H24 1050  1    _REFUNDS._
H24 1050  2       An overpayment of income and social security taxes
H24 1060  1    entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the
H24 1060 11    return that the overpayment should be applied to your
H24 1070  7    succeeding year's estimated tax.
H24 1080  2       If you file Form 1040A and the District Director
H24 1090  1    computes your tax, any refund to which you are entitled
H24 1090 11    will be mailed to you.
H24 1100  4       If you file a Form 1040, you should indicate in
H24 1110  2    the place provided that there is an overpayment of
H24 1110 11    tax and the amount you want refunded and the amount
H24 1120  8    you want credited against your estimated tax.
H24 1130  3       Refunds of less than $1 will not be made unless
H24 1140  2    you attach a separate application to your return requesting
H24 1140 11    such a refund.
H24 1150  3    _WHERE TO FILE._
H24 1150  6       Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue
H24 1160  4    for the district in which you have your legal residence
H24 1170  1    or principal place of business. If you have neither
H24 1170 10    a legal residence nor a principal place of business
H24 1180  7    in any internal revenue district, your return should
H24 1190  4    be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue,
H24 1200  2    Baltimore 2, Md. If your principal place of abode
H24 1210  1    for the tax year is outside the United States (including
H24 1210 11    Alaska and Hawaii), Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands
H24 1220  9    and you have no legal residence or principal place
H24 1230  5    of business in any internal revenue district in the
H24 1240  4    United States, you should file your return with the
H24 1250  1    Office of International Operations, Internal Revenue
H24 1250  7    Service, Washington 25, D.C.
H24 1260  3    _ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME_
H24 1260  6       The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross
H24 1270  6    Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis. It
H24 1280  5    is the amount you enter on line 9, page 1 of Form 1040.
H24 1290  2    Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to
H24 1290 10    determine Adjusted Gross Income. Other deductions are
H24 1300  7    subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving
H24 1310  7    at Taxable Income.
H24 1320  1       TO COMPUTE YOUR ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME you total
H24 1320  9    all items of income. (See Chapter 6.) From this amount
H24 1330  9    deduct the items indicated below.
H24 1340  2       Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses
H24 1350  2    attributable to a trade or business.
H24 1360  1    _RENTS OR ROYALTIES._
H24 1360  1       If you hold property for the production of rents
H24 1360 10    or royalties you subtract, in computing Adjusted Gross
H24 1370  6    Income, ordinary and necessary expenses and certain
H24 1380  4    other deductions attributable to the property. (See
H24 1390  2    Chapter 15.)
H24 1390  4       Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable
H24 1400  2    to earning a salary, commission, or other compensation.
H24 1410  1    (See Chapter 10.)
H24 1410  4       Employees deduct expenses of travel, meals and lodging
H24 1420  4    while away from home in connection with the performance
H24 1430  1    of their services as employees. They also deduct transportation
H24 1440  1    expenses incurred in connection with the performance
H24 1440  8    of services as employees even though they are not away
H24 1450  7    from home. (See Chapter 12.) If your employer reimburses
H24 1460  5    you for expenses incurred, you deduct such expenses
H24 1470  2    if they otherwise qualify. (See Chapter 10.)
H24 1470  9       Sick pay, if included in your Gross Income, is deducted
H24 1480 10    in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income. If your sick
H24 1490  8    pay is not included in your Gross Income, you may not
H24 1500  6    deduct it. (See Chapter 9.)
H24 1510  1    _INCOME FROM ESTATES AND TRUSTS._
H24 1510  5       If you are a life tenant, you deduct allowable depreciation
H24 1520  2    and depletion. If you are an income beneficiary of
H24 1530  1    property held in trust or an heir, legatee, or devisee,
H24 1530 11    you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion,
H24 1540  5    if not deductible by the estate or trust.
H24 1550  3       Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property
H24 1560  2    are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income.
H24 1560 10    (See Chapter 20.)
H24 1570  3    _50% OF CAPITAL GAINS._
H24 1570  7       You also deduct 50% of the excess of net long-term
H24 1580  8    capital gains over net short-term capital losses in
H24 1590  3    determining Adjusted Gross Income. (See Chapter 24.)
H24 1600  1    _OTHER DEDUCTIONS._
H24 1600  3       Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining
H24 1610  2    Adjusted Gross Income. They may be claimed only by
H24 1610 11    itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040. These deductions
H24 1620 10    may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard
H24 1630  8    Deduction or tax Table. (See Chapters 30 through 37.)
H24 1640  5    #2. MINORS MINORS MUST ALSO FILE RETURNS IF THEY EARN
H24 1650  4    $600 OR MORE DURING THE YEAR.#
H24 1650 10    A MINOR IS subject to tax on his own earnings even
H24 1660  8    though his parent may, under local law, have the right
H24 1670  5    to them and might actually have received the money.
H24 1680  1    His income is not required to be included in the return
H24 1680 12    of his parent.
H24 1690  1       A MINOR CHILD IS ALLOWED A PERSONAL EXEMPTION of
H24 1700  2    $600 on his own return regardless of how much money
H24 1700 12    he may earn.
H24 1710  1    _EXEMPTION ALSO ALLOWED PARENT._
H24 1710  4       If your child is under 19 or is a student you may
H24 1720  4    also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as
H24 1720 14    your dependent, even though he earns $600 or more.
H24 1730  9    See Chapter 5.
H24 1740  1    _EXAMPLE._
H24 1740  1       Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961. You spent
H24 1740 12    $800 for his support. Since he had gross income of
H24 1750  9    $600 or more, he must file a return in which he may
H24 1760  7    claim an exemption deduction of $600. Since you contributed
H24 1770  3    more than half of his support, you may also claim an
H24 1780  1    exemption for him on your return.
H24 1780  7    _HE MAY GET A TAX REFUND._
H24 1780 13       A minor who has gross income of less than $600 is
H24 1790 11    entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from
H24 1800  6    his wages. Generally, the refund may be obtained by
H24 1810  3    filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement
H24 1820  1    (Form W-2). If he had income other than wages subject
H24 1820 12    to withholding, he may be required to file Form 1040.
H24 1830 10    See Chapter 1.
H24 1840  1       IF YOUR CHILD WORKS FOR YOU, you may deduct reasonable
H24 1850  1    wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your
H24 1850 12    business. You may deduct these payments even though
H24 1860  8    your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing
H24 1870  5    or other necessities which you are normally obligated
H24 1880  2    to furnish him, and even though you may be entitled
H24 1880 12    to his services.
