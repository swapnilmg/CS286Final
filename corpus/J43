J43 0010  1    Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested
J43 0010 11    on the Article I power. In this view, supported by
J43 0020  8    only three members of the Court, a power denied by
J43 0030  6    the specific provisions of Article III was granted
J43 0040  3    by the generality of Article I. If this seems arbitrary,
J43 0050  1    its effect was to treat citizens of the District of
J43 0050 11    Columbia equally with citizens of the states- at the
J43 0060  8    expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction.
J43 0070  2    #FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION#
J43 0070  5    For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts
J43 0080  9    (subject to review by the Supreme Court) for the protection
J43 0090  6    of most rights arising under national law. Then in
J43 0100  4    1875, apparently in response to the nationalizing influence
J43 0110  2    of the Civil War, Congress first gave the lower federal
J43 0110 12    courts general authority- concurrently with state tribunals-
J43 0120  7    to decide cases involving federal-right questions.
J43 0130  6    One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic
J43 0140  5    enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments
J43 0150  3    against state interference. Serious difficulty arose
J43 0160  1    with the advent of Substantive Due Process. An amendment,
J43 0160 10    presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly
J43 0170  9    freed slaves, became a "laissez-faire" limitation upon
J43 0180  6    state economic policy. A flood of federal lower court
J43 0190  5    injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local
J43 0200  2    government. Congress reacted with a series of measures
J43 0200 10    modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875.
J43 0210 10    In 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge
J43 0220  7    court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed
J43 0230  4    direct appeals to the Supreme Court. Such legislation
J43 0240  2    was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter.
J43 0250  1    In 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay
J43 0250 11    of federal injunction proceedings upon institution
J43 0260  4    of state court test cases. The essential ineffectiveness
J43 0270  2    of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination
J43 0280  2    of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility
J43 0280 10    rate orders. Three years later similar restraints were
J43 0290  8    imposed upon injunctions against collection of state
J43 0300  5    taxes. This saved for state adjudication, in the first
J43 0310  4    instance, the two major areas where federal injunctions
J43 0320  1    had been most obnoxious, but other areas remained vulnerable.
J43 0330  1       Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, like Congress, showed
J43 0330  8    misgivings concerning this aspect of government by
J43 0340  7    injunction. Drawing upon the traditional discretion
J43 0350  4    of the chancellor, Mr. Justice Holmes introduced a
J43 0360  3    series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated
J43 0370  1    in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention.
J43 0380  1    Whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon
J43 0380  9    the availability of adequate state remedies, the new
J43 0390  7    emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at
J43 0400  5    issue. The classic case is Railroad Commission v. Pullman.
J43 0410  3    The commission had issued an administrative order which
J43 0420  2    was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes. Its
J43 0420  9    enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court.
J43 0430  8    On review the Supreme Court, via Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
J43 0440  6    found southern racial problems "a sensitive area of
J43 0450  5    social policy on which the federal courts ought not
J43 0460  2    to enter unless no alternative to ... adjudication
J43 0460 10    is open". An alternative was found in the vagueness
J43 0470  8    of state law as to whether the offending order had
J43 0480  5    in fact been authorized. Reluctant, as usual, to interpret
J43 0490  3    state legislation- such interpretation can only be
J43 0500  1    a "forecast rather than a determination"- Mr. Justice
J43 0500  9    Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction.
J43 0510  9    But it is crucial that here, unlike Burford, the trial
J43 0520  7    court was ordered to retain the case until the state
J43 0530  6    courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the
J43 0540  4    state-law question. "The resources of equity are equal
J43 0550  1    to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative
J43 0550 12    decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional
J43 0560  9    adjudication".
J43 0570  1       Temporary abstention, i.e., postponement, is one
J43 0570  7    thing; refusal to adjudicate is another. To the extent
J43 0580  9    that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified
J43 0590  6    by subsequent legislation, federal equitable relief
J43 0600  3    against state action must be available- or so it seems
J43 0610  3    to Mr. Justice Frankfurter. In Alabama Public Service
J43 0620  1    Commission v. Southern Ry. Co., the commission had
J43 0630  1    refused to permit abandonment of certain "uneconomic"
J43 0630  8    train facilities. The railroad, claiming deprivation
J43 0640  5    of property without due process of law, sought injunctive
J43 0650  5    relief. The Court held that federal jurisdiction should
J43 0660  3    not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state
J43 0670  1    be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion.
J43 0680  1       Justices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in the
J43 0680  7    Court's result, for they found no merit in the railroad's
J43 0690  9    claim. But they objected vigorously to the proposition
J43 0700  5    that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction
J43 0710  2    conferred in a valid act of Congress:
J43 0720  1       "By one fell swoop the Court now finds that Congress
J43 0720 10    indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910,
J43 0730  7    1913, 1925, 1934 and 1937. By these measures, Congress,
J43 0740  4    so the Court [in effect] now decides, gave not only
J43 0750  3    needless but inadequate relief, since it now appears
J43 0750 11    that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize
J43 0770  9    the Act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging
J43 0780  4    local regulation".
J43 0780  6       A most revealing recent case is Textile Workers
J43 0790  7    Union v. Lincoln Mills. The Taft-Hartley Act gave the
J43 0800  8    federal courts jurisdiction over "suits for violation
J43 0810  5    of contracts between an employer and a labor organization
J43 0820  3    representing employees in an industry affecting commerce".
J43 0830  1    On its face this merely provides a federal forum; it
J43 0830 11    does not establish any law (rights) for the federal
J43 0840  9    judges to enforce. How can judges exercise jurisdiction
J43 0850  5    to enforce national rights when Congress has created
J43 0860  3    none? The Court held that Congress had intended the
J43 0870  2    federal judiciary to "fashion" an appropriate law of
J43 0870 10    labor-management contracts. In short, congressional
J43 0880  5    power to grant federal-question authority to federal
J43 0890  4    courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need
J43 0900  2    not create, or specify, the right to be enforced.
J43 0910  1       The Lincoln Mills decision authorizes a whole new
J43 0910  8    body of federal "common law" which, as Mr. Justice
J43 0920  7    Frankfurter pointed out in dissent, leads to one of
J43 0930  7    the following "incongruities": "(1) conflict in federal
J43 0940  4    and state court interpretations of collective bargaining
J43 0950  2    agreements; (2) displacement of state law by federal
J43 0950 10    law in state courts ... in all actions regarding collective
J43 0960 10    bargaining agreements; or (3) exclusion of state court
J43 0970  7    jurisdiction over these matters". The Justice's elaborate
J43 0980  4    examination of the legislative history of the provision
J43 0990  4    in question suggests that Congress' purpose was merely
J43 1000  3    to make unions suable. With a few exceptions, the lawmakers
J43 1010  1    seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal
J43 1010  9    jurisdiction involved- to say nothing of the delegation
J43 1020  7    of lawmaking power to judges. To avoid these constitutional
J43 1030  5    difficulties, Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared
J43 1040  3    to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with
J43 1050  2    diversity, rather than federal question, jurisdiction.
J43 1050  8    This would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major
J43 1060  8    purpose- the suability of unions. It would also leave
J43 1070  7    intact the states' traditional authority in the realm
J43 1080  5    of contract law. (As we have seen, the Erie and York
J43 1090  3    decisions require federal courts in diversity cases
J43 1100  1    to follow state decisional rules.) Here again Mr. Justice
J43 1100 10    Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle
J43 1110  7    of wholesale judicial legislation. If Congress wants
J43 1120  5    to displace the states from areas which they have customarily
J43 1130  5    occupied, let it do so knowingly and explicitly. And
J43 1140  2    let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal
J43 1180  1    judges. Does Lincoln Mills suggest that if Congress
J43 1180  9    granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases,
J43 1190  5    the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a
J43 1200  5    national law for the dissolution of marriages?
J43 1210  1       There is a common problem behind most of these federal
J43 1210 11    question and diversity cases. Congress has not clearly
J43 1220  8    defined the bounds between state and federal court
J43 1230  6    competence. It has the power to do so but for the most
J43 1240  6    part has left the matter for solution by judges on
J43 1250  1    a case-by-case basis. A careful student has suggested
J43 1250 11    that "In any new revision [of the Judicial Code] the
J43 1260  8    legislators would do well to remember that the allocation
J43 1270  6    of power to the federal courts should be limited to
J43 1280  4    those matters in which their expertise in federal law
J43 1290  1    might be used, leaving to the state judiciaries the
J43 1290 10    primary obligation of pronouncing state law". Obviously,
J43 1300  6    the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in
J43 1310  4    Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinions- to the extent that
J43 1320  4    Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion.
J43 1330  1    The same rule of specialization and division of labor
J43 1330 10    guides him in the FELA certiorari cases, in the administrative
J43 1340  8    law area, and indeed in the whole realm of judicial
J43 1350  9    review. Mr. Justice Black no doubt concurs in principle
J43 1360  6    but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous
J43 1370  4    and "just" result. He will not be "fooled by technicalities".
J43 1380  3    #FEDERAL REVIEW OF STATE DECISIONS#
J43 1380  8    With few exceptions, Congress has not given federal
J43 1390  7    courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising
J43 1400  5    under federal law. To put it differently, state and
J43 1410  3    federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect
J43 1420  1    to most claims of federal right. To insure uniformity
J43 1420 10    in the meaning of national law, however, state interpretations
J43 1430  7    are subject to Supreme Court review. It may be noted,
J43 1440  7    parenthetically, that to evade "desegregation" an ex-Justice
J43 1450  4    and former southern governor has urged Congress to
J43 1460  3    abolish this reviewing authority. The result, of course,
J43 1470  1    would be that federal law inevitably would mean different
J43 1470 10    things in different states. It would also probably
J43 1480  7    mean different things within the same state- depending
J43 1482  5    upon what court (state or federal) rendered decision.
J43 1490  2       We consider here only a few of many problems involved
J43 1500  1    in this crucial federal-state relationship. The first
J43 1500  9    is that enforcement of national law in state litigation
J43 1510  7    raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation
J43 1520  6    of procedure to substance. Subject to certain constitutional
J43 1530  3    restraints in favor of fair trials, each level of government
J43 1540  3    is free to devise its own judicial procedures. Litigants
J43 1550  1    who choose to assert federal claims in a state court
J43 1550 11    go into that court subject to its rules of procedure.
J43 1560  8    A similar canon applies to those who press state claims
J43 1561  5    in federal tribunals, e.g., in diversity cases. In
J43 1562  3    an FELA controversy the state court followed established
J43 1570  7    state procedure by construing a vague complaint "most
J43 1580  7    strongly against" the complainant. In other words the
J43 1590  5    burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader
J43 1600  3    by state law. The result was that the plaintiff's case
J43 1610  1    was dismissed. Mr. Justice Black led a reversing majority:
J43 1610 10    "Strict local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose
J43 1620 10    unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized
J43 1630  6    by federal law". Here, as in the Byrd case, another
J43 1640  6    element of state procedure was subsumed to federal
J43 1650  3    judge-made law. Justices Frankfurter and Jackson dissented:
J43 1660  1    "One State may cherish formalities more than another,
J43 1660  9    one State may be more responsive than another to procedural
J43 1670 10    reforms. If a litigant chooses to enforce a Federal
J43 1680  8    right in a State court, he cannot be heard to object
J43 1690  6    if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press
J43 1700  2    like claims arising under State law with regard to
J43 1700 11    the form in which the claim must be stated- the particularity,
J43 1710 10    for instance, with which a cause of action must be
J43 1720  9    described. Federal law, though invoked in a State court,
J43 1730  5    delimits the Federal claim- defines what gives a right
J43 1740  4    to recovery and what goes to prove it. But the form
J43 1740 15    in which the claim must be stated need not be different
J43 1750 11    from what the State exacts in the enforcement of like
J43 1760  7    obligations created by it, so long as a requirement
J43 1770  4    does not add to, or diminish, the right as defined
J43 1780  1    by Federal law, nor burden the realization of this
J43 1780 10    right in the actualities of litigation".
J43 1790  3       Another problem in the area of federal-state relationships
J43 1800  2    is this: what constitutes reversible error in a state
J43 1810  3    decision? Terminiello v. Chicago involved a conviction
J43 1820  1    for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance. The
J43 1820  9    conduct in question was a speech. The accused did not
J43 1830 10    object to the trial court's charge to the jury that
J43 1840  6    discourse "may constitute a breach of the peace if
J43 1850  4    it stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings
J43 1850 13    about a condition of unrest ...". For present purposes
J43 1860  9    it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited
J43 1870  7    speech as to violate the federal Constitution. Though
J43 1880  3    the accused raised many other objections, he did not
J43 1890  3    object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings.
J43 1900  1    That is, he did not claim in any of the four courts
J43 1900 13    through which his case progressed that the jury charge
J43 1910  7    had denied him any federal right.
