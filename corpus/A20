A20 0010  1    _LONDON, FEB. 9_
A20 0010  4       - Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine,
A20 0020  2    the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire
A20 0020 10    United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet,
A20 0030  8    were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring, secret
A20 0040  7    service agents testified today.
A20 0050  1       The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by
A20 0050  9    the United States in 1959 and was launched last year.
A20 0060  9    It is a killer sub- that is, a hunter of enemy subs.
A20 0070  7    It has a hull patterned on that of the United States
A20 0080  3    navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.
A20 0090  1    Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor
A20 0090 10    of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.
A20 0100  6    #FIVE HELD FOR TRIAL#
A20 0110  1    The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought
A20 0110  9    had been stolen was made in Bow st. police court here
A20 0120  9    at the end of a three day hearing. A full trial was
A20 0130  6    ordered for:
A20 0130  8       Two British civil servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46,
A20 0140  6    and her newly devoted friend, Harry Houghton, 55, and
A20 0150  4    divorced. They are accused of whisking secrets out
A20 0160  1    of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.
A20 0160  9       Gordon A. Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man presumed to
A20 0170  8    be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport. When
A20 0180  5    arrested, he had the submarine secrets on a roll of
A20 0190  5    candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets
A20 0190 14    in Christmas gift wrapping, it was testified.
A20 0200  7    #FLASHED TO MOSCOW#
A20 0200 10    A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger,
A20 0210  8    bookseller, and wife, Joyce.
A20 0220  2       [In Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
A20 0230  1    identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen, an
A20 0230 10    American couple formerly of New York City.]
A20 0240  7       In their suburban cottage the crown charges, the
A20 0250  6    Krogers received secrets from the mystery man, usually
A20 0260  3    on the first Saturday evening of each month, and spent
A20 0270  2    much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow,
A20 0270 13    either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen
A20 0280  9    floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books.
A20 0290  7    Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition
A20 0300  4    as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.
A20 0310  1       All five pleaded innocent. Only Miss Gee asked for
A20 0310 10    bail. Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded
A20 0320  8    that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by
A20 0330  7    her widowed mother, 80, her maiden aunt, also 80 and
A20 0340  5    bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once
A20 0350  1    ran a candy shop.
A20 0350  5    #REFUSES TO GRANT BAIL#
A20 0350  9    "I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them", said
A20 0360  8    the magistrate, K.J.P. Baraclough.
A20 0370  1       The trial will be held, probably the first week
A20 0370 10    of March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal
A20 0380  9    court where Klaus Fuchs, the naturalized British German
A20 0390  6    born scientist who succeeded in giving American and
A20 0400  5    British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed
A20 0410  3    world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14
A20 0410 12    years in prison.
A20 0420  3       Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced
A20 0430  1    by the new five, who may have altered history in the
A20 0430 12    1960s. Fuchs, after nine and a half years, was released,
A20 0440  9    being given time off for good behavior. He promptly
A20 0450  4    went to communist East Germany.
A20 0450  9       The magistrate tonight refused to return to the
A20 0460  8    five $29,000 in American and British currency, mostly
A20 0470  5    $20 bills, and in British government bonds and stocks.
A20 0480  4       "This is Russian money", said Mervin Griffith-Jones
A20 0490  1    for the attorney general's office. He asserted that
A20 0500  1    the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the
A20 0500 10    Red paymaster, and the two civil servants the recipients
A20 0510  8    for selling their country's secrets.
A20 0520  2    #"OF HIGHEST VALUE"#
A20 0520  5    The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought, and thereby
A20 0530  5    of the American undersea fleet, were involved in the
A20 0540  3    spy case had been hinted at earlier.
A20 0540 10       But just before luncheon today the fact was announced
A20 0550  7    grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet
A20 0560  6    on underwater warfare, Capt. George Symonds. He said
A20 0570  4    that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details
A20 0580  2    about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped
A20 0580 11    roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested
A20 0590  9    with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater
A20 0600  6    Saturday afternoon, Jan. 7.
A20 0610  1       The information, he said, would have been of the
A20 0610 10    highest value to a potential enemy.
A20 0620  4    #COURT CLEARED#
A20 0620  6    Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when
A20 0630  5    the ring, watched for six months, was broken remained
A20 0640  2    untold.
A20 0640  3       The British defending lawyers, who today increased
A20 0650  1    from three to four, demanded to know if they could
A20 0650 11    make the information involved seem of little value
A20 0660  6    to a jury, the chances of their clients would improve.
A20 0670  4    So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the
A20 0680  2    court of all except officials to allow the captain
A20 0680 11    to elaborate for almost an hour.
A20 0690  5       Almost any information about the Dreadnought would
A20 0700  2    also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
A20 0710  1    Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere
A20 0710 11    until the American government decided to end a ban
A20 0720  7    on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been
A20 0730  5    imposed after Fuchs blabbed. The United States offered
A20 0740  3    to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like
A20 0750  1    that used in the Skipjack.
A20 0750  6       With the machinery went a complete design for the
A20 0760  4    hull.
A20 0760  5       The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub,
A20 0770  3    much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which
A20 0770 13    preceded it.
A20 0780  2    #NAVY'S FUTURE INVOLVED#
A20 0780  5    "Much of the navy's future depends upon her", an American
A20 0790  6    naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival
A20 0800  4    in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition to
A20 0810  2    selected high officers at Portland underwater research
A20 0810  9    station. It was there that the two accused civil servants
A20 0820 10    were at work.
A20 0830  1       "Her basic hull form [a teardrop] and her nuclear
A20 0830 10    power plant will be used for almost all new submarines,
A20 0840 10    including the potent Polaris missile submarines", the
A20 0850  5    statement went on.
A20 0850  8       The atom reactor, water cooled, was the result of
A20 0860  8    almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch
A20 0870  6    of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric
A20 0880  2    Corp. Thru development, the reactor and its steam
A20 0890  2    turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also
A20 0890 11    in complexity, allowing a single propeller to be used,
A20 0900  8    the navy said.
A20 0900 11       The hull was also a result of almost a decade of
A20 0910 11    work. It was first tried out on a conventional submarine,
A20 0920  6    the Albacore, in 1954.
A20 0920 10       The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built.
A20 0930  8    Reputedly it could outrun, underwater, the fastest
A20 0940  5    destroyers. It could, reputedly, go 70,000 miles without
A20 0950  4    refueling and stay down more than a month.
A20 0960  1       It was of the hunter-killer type, designed to seek
A20 0960 10    out ships and other submarines with its most advance
A20 0970  6    gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
A20 0980  1       The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions
A20 0980 11    found in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed
A20 0990 10    back, have given the Kremlin a complete picture "of
A20 1000  8    our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown
A20 1010  6    what we are doing in research and development for the
A20 1020  3    future".
A20 1020  4    #INTERESTED IN DETECTOR#
A20 1020  7    The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC,
A20 1030  6    the underwater equipment for detecting submarines,
A20 1040  4    it was testified. Range was a vital detail. Designs
A20 1050  2    of parts were sought.
A20 1050  6       Six radiomen told how, twice on two days after the
A20 1060  6    ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was heard
A20 1070  2    calling, using signals, times and wavelengths specified
A20 1070  9    on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's
A20 1080  8    apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened
A20 1090  6    to the transmitter lid. Oddly, the calls were still
A20 1100  5    heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
A20 1110  1       The charge that the federal indictment of three
A20 1110  9    Chicago narcotics detail detectives "is the product
A20 1120  6    of rumor, combined with malice, and individual enmity"
A20 1130  4    on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was
A20 1140  2    made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge
A20 1140 10    Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court.
A20 1150  7       The three- Miles J. Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and
A20 1160  5    Richard Austin- and eight other defendants are charged
A20 1170  4    in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal
A20 1180  2    narcotic laws.
A20 1180  4       In his opening statement to a jury of eight women
A20 1190  4    and four men, Bernard H. Sokol, attorney for the detectives,
A20 1200  1    said that evidence would show that his clients were
A20 1200 10    "entirely innocent".
A20 1210  2    #'HAD TO KNOW PEDDLERS'#
A20 1210  6    "When they became members of the city police narcotics
A20 1220  7    unit", Sokol said, "they were told they would have
A20 1230  5    to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics
A20 1240  2    were sold and they would have to get to know people
A20 1240 13    in the narcotics racket. They, on occasion, posed as
A20 1250  9    addicts and peddlers".
A20 1260  1       Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes
A20 1260  8    worked together, Sokol continued, rivalries developed
A20 1280  3    when they were "aiming at the same criminals". This,
A20 1290  6    he added, brought about "petty jealousies" and "petty
A20 1300  3    personal grievances".
A20 1300  5       "In the same five year period that the United States
A20 1310  8    says they [the detectives] were engaged in this conspiracy",
A20 1320  6    Sokol continued, "these three young men received a
A20 1330  5    total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations,
A20 1340  2    and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the
A20 1350  1    mayor's medal".
A20 1350  3    #NO COMMENTS BY U.S.#
A20 1350  7    In opening, D. Arthur Connelly, assistant United States
A20 1360  6    attorney, read the indictment, but made no comments.
A20 1370  5    Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only
A20 1380  3    that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.
A20 1390  1       Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700
A20 1390  8    worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis
A20 1400  7    Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana av. Among other acts, Teller
A20 1410  5    and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears.
A20 1420  3       The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835 Michigan
A20 1430  2    av., a real estate agent and former bail bondsman,
A20 1430 11    took the stand after opening statements had been made.
A20 1440  8    But court adjourned after he testified he introduced
A20 1450  5    James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings, two of the
A20 1460  4    defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy,
A20 1470  2    a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
A20 1480  1       Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart av., a CTA
A20 1480 10    bus driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a
A20 1490 10    group of youths at 51st street and South Park way.
A20 1500  6    Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a
A20 1510  4    cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
A20 1520  1    His losses included his money bag, containing $40 to
A20 1520 10    $50 and his $214 paycheck.
A20 1530  2       Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd
A20 1540  2    of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded
A20 1540 11    his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational
A20 1550  9    High school, 30th street and South Park way, and began
A20 1560  8    "skylarking".
A20 1560  9       When 51st street was reached, Robinson related,
A20 1570  7    he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going
A20 1580  6    to call the CTA supervisor. As he left the bus with
A20 1590  4    his money bag, Robinson added, the largest youth accosted
A20 1600  1    him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down.
A20 1600 11    Then the youths fled with his money.
A20 1620  1       Mrs. Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years
A20 1620 10    in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder
A20 1630  7    in 1935 of her son-in-law, Ervin Lang, then 28, appealed
A20 1640  5    for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois
A20 1650  3    pardon and parole board members, John M. Bookwalter
A20 1660  1    and Joseph Carpentier. She had been sentenced to 180
A20 1660 10    years in prison, but former Gov. Stratton commuted
A20 1670  7    her term to 75 years, making her eligible for parole,
A20 1680  5    as one of his last acts in office.
A20 1690  1       Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the
A20 1690 10    son-in-law became her lover after the death of her
A20 1700  8    daughter in 1934. It was when he attempted to end the
A20 1710  5    relationship that the murder took place.
A20 1720  1       The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined
A20 1720 10    $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for
A20 1730  9    leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase
A20 1740  6    over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20.
A20 1750  2       The defendant, William L. Stickney III 23, of 3211
A20 1760  2    Park pl., Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless
A20 1760 10    driving, also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to
A20 1770  8    attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night
A20 1780  5    for one month.
A20 1780  8       Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing, Inc., 2544
A20 1790  6    Green Bay rd., Evanston, a food brokerage and grocery
A20 1800  5    chain firm, of which his father, William L. Jr., is
A20 1810  3    president.
A20 1810  4       Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit
A20 1820  5    when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart
A20 1830  1    avenue at Central street.
A20 1830  5       At Jenks street, Simms said, the car skidded completely
A20 1840  5    around, just missed two parked cars, and sped east
A20 1850  3    in Jenks.
A20 1850  5       The car spun around again, Simms said, before Stickney
A20 1860  3    could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated
A20 1870  1    two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette
A20 1870 10    in Prairie.
