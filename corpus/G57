G57 0010  1       But it would not be very satisfactory to leave our
G57 0010 11    conclusions at the point just reached. fortunately,
G57 0020  7    it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual
G57 0030  5    in diagnosing the involvement of values in education.
G57 0040  2    For this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological
G57 0040 12    and psychological studies of students in American colleges
G57 0050  8    and universities, and particularly from the Cornell
G57 0060  6    Values Studies. In the latter research program, information
G57 0070  2    is available for 2,758 Cornell students surveyed in
G57 0080  3    1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952. Of the
G57 0090  1    latter sample, 944 persons had been studied two years
G57 0090 10    earlier; hence changes in attitudes and values can
G57 0100  7    be analyzed for identical individuals at two points
G57 0110  4    in time. In addition, the 1952 study collected comparable
G57 0120  2    data from 4,585 students at ten other colleges and
G57 0120 11    universities scattered across the country: Dartmouth,
G57 0130  6    Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan, North Carolina, Fisk, Texas,
G57 0140  5    University of California at Los Angeles, Wayne, and
G57 0150  5    Michigan.
G57 0150  6       We find, in the first place, that the students overwhelmingly
G57 0160  6    approve of higher education, positively evaluate the
G57 0170  4    job their own institution is doing, do not accept most
G57 0180  3    of the criticisms levelled against higher education
G57 0180 10    in the public prints, and, on the whole, approve of
G57 0190  9    the way their university deals with value-problems
G57 0200  5    and value inculcation. It is not our impression that
G57 0210  2    these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants
G57 0210  8    of blissful ignorance; rather, the generality of these
G57 0220  7    students find their university experience congenial
G57 0230  4    to their own sense of values.
G57 0240  1       Students are approximately equally divided between
G57 0240  6    those who regard vocational preparation as the primary
G57 0250  6    goal of an ideal education and those who chose a general
G57 0260  5    liberal education. Other conceivable goals, such as
G57 0270  3    character-education and social adjustment, are of secondary
G57 0280  1    importance to them. The ideal of a liberal education
G57 0280 10    impresses itself upon the students more and more as
G57 0290  8    they move through college. Even in such technical curricula
G57 0300  5    as engineering, the senior is much more likely than
G57 0310  3    the freshman to choose, as an ideal, liberal education
G57 0310 12    over specific vocational preparation. In the university
G57 0320  7    milieu of scholarship and research, of social diversity,
G57 0330  6    of new ideas and varied and wide-ranging interests,
G57 0340  4    "socialization" into a campus culture apparently means
G57 0350  2    heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education
G57 0360  1    in the arts and sciences.
G57 0360  6       Students' choices of ideal educational goals are
G57 0370  4    not arbitrary or whimsical. There is a clear relationship
G57 0380  2    between their educational evaluations and their basic
G57 0390  1    pattern of general values. The selective and directional
G57 0390  9    qualities of basic value-orientations are clearly evident
G57 0400  7    in these data: the "success-oriented" students choose
G57 0420  3    vocational preparation, the "other-directed" choose
G57 0430  2    goals of social adjustment ("getting along with people"),
G57 0440  2    the "intellectuals" choose a liberal arts emphasis.
G57 0440  9       The same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational
G57 0450  9    choices. There is impressive consistency between specific
G57 0460  7    occupational preferences and the student's basic conception
G57 0470  7    of what is for him a good way of life. And, contrary
G57 0480  7    to many popular assertions, the goal-values chosen
G57 0490  2    do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic
G57 0500  1    success nor to mere conformity. Our students want occupations
G57 0510  1    that permit them to use their talents and training,
G57 0510 10    to be creative and original, to work with and to help
G57 0520  9    other people. They also want money, prestige, and security.
G57 0530  5    But they are optimistic about their prospects in these
G57 0540  4    regards; they set limits to their aspirations- few
G57 0550  4    aspire to millions of dollars or to "imperial" power
G57 0550 13    and glory. Within the fixed frame of these aspirations,
G57 0560  9    they can afford to place a high value on the expressive
G57 0570  9    and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize
G57 0580  5    the instrumental-reward values of power, prestige,
G57 0590  2    and wealth.
G57 0590  4       Occupational choices are also useful- and interesting-
G57 0600  3    in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute
G57 0610  1    the only component in goals and aspirations. For there
G57 0610 10    is also the "face of reality" in the form of the individual's
G57 0620 10    perceptions of his own abilities and interests, of
G57 0630  7    the objective possibilities open to him, of the familial
G57 0640  6    and other social pressures to which he is exposed.
G57 0650  1    We find "reluctant recruits" whose values are not in
G57 0650 10    line with their expected occupation's characteristics.
G57 0660  5    Students develop occupational images- not always accurate
G57 0670  4    or detailed- and they try to fit their values to the
G57 0680  6    presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation.
G57 0690  1    The purely cognitive or informational problems are
G57 0690  8    often acute. Furthermore, many reluctant recruits are
G57 0700  6    yielding to social demands, or compromising in the
G57 0710  5    face of their own limitations of opportunity, or of
G57 0720  3    ability and performance. Thus, many a creativity-oriented
G57 0720 11    aspirant for a career in architecture, drama, or journalism,
G57 0730  9    resigns himself to a real estate business; many a people-oriented
G57 0740 10    student who dreams of the M.D. decides to enter his
G57 0750  8    father's advertising agency; and many a hopeful incipient
G57 0760  6    business executive decides it were better to teach
G57 0770  4    the theory of business administration than to practice
G57 0780  1    it. The old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is
G57 0780 10    extant- but so is the recognition that the main chance
G57 0790  9    may be in a corporate bureaucracy.
G57 0800  1       In their views on dating, courtship, sex, and family
G57 0810  1    life, our students prefer what they are expected to
G57 0810 10    prefer. For them, in the grim words of a once-popular
G57 0820  9    song, love and marriage go together like a horse and
G57 0830  5    carriage. Their expressed standards concerning sex
G57 0840  2    roles, desirable age for marriage, characteristics
G57 0840  8    of an ideal mate, number of children desired are congruent
G57 0850  7    with the values and stereotypes of the preceding generation-
G57 0860  5    minus compulsive rebellion. They even accept the "double
G57 0870  5    standard" of sex morality in a double sense, i.e.,
G57 0880  2    both sexes agree that standards for men differ from
G57 0880 11    standards for women, and women apply to both sexes
G57 0890  9    a standard different from that held by men.
G57 0900  5       "Conservatism" and "traditionalism" seem implied
G57 0910  3    by what has just been said. But these terms are treacherous.
G57 0920  1    In the field of political values, it is certainly true
G57 0920 11    that students are not radical, not rebels against their
G57 0930  9    parents or their peers. And as they go through college,
G57 0940  7    the students tend to bring their political position
G57 0950  3    in line with that prevalent in the social groups to
G57 0960  2    which they belong. Yet they have accepted most of the
G57 0960 12    extant "welfare state" provisions for health, security,
G57 0970  6    and the regulation of economic affairs, and they overwhelmingly
G57 0980  6    approve of the traditional "liberalism" of the Bill
G57 0990  5    of Rights. When their faith in civil liberties is tested
G57 1000  4    against strong pressures of social expediency in specific
G57 1010  1    issues, e.g., suppression of "dangerous ideas", many
G57 1010  8    waver and give in. The students who are most willing
G57 1020 10    to acquiesce in the suppression of civil liberties
G57 1030  5    are also those who are most likely to be prejudiced
G57 1040  3    against minority groups, to be conformist and traditionalistic
G57 1050  1    in general social attitudes, and to lack a basic faith
G57 1050 11    in people.
G57 1060  1       As one looks at the existing evidence, one finds
G57 1060 10    a correlation, although only a slight one, between
G57 1070  7    high grades and "libertarian" values. But the correlation
G57 1080  5    is substantial only among upperclassmen. In other words,
G57 1090  4    as students go through college, those who are most
G57 1100  2    successful academically tend to become more committed
G57 1100  9    to a "Bill of Rights" orientation. College in gross-
G57 1110  7    just the general experience- may have varying effects,
G57 1120  7    but the the students who are successful emerge with
G57 1130  3    strengthened and clarified democratic values. This
G57 1140  2    finding is consistent also with the fact that student
G57 1140 11    leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values
G57 1150  9    implicit in civil liberties than the other students.
G57 1160  5       There is now substantial evidence from several major
G57 1170  4    studies of college students that the experience of
G57 1180  1    the college years results in a certain, selective homogenization
G57 1180 10    of attitudes and values. Detached from their prior
G57 1190  8    statuses and social groups and exposed to the pervasive
G57 1200  7    stimuli of the university milieu, the students tend
G57 1210  4    to assimilate a new common culture, to converge toward
G57 1220  2    norms characteristic of their own particular campus.
G57 1220  9    Furthermore, in certain respects, there are norms common
G57 1230  8    to colleges and universities across the country. For
G57 1240  5    instance, college-educated people consistently show
G57 1250  2    up in study after study as more often than others supporters
G57 1260  1    of the Bill of Rights and other democratic rights and
G57 1260 11    liberties. The interesting thing in this connection
G57 1270  7    is that the norms upon which students tend to converge
G57 1280  5    include toleration of diversity.
G57 1290  1       To the extent that our sampling of the orientations
G57 1290  9    of American college students in the years 1950 and
G57 1300  7    1952 may be representative of our culture- and still
G57 1310  3    valid in 1959- we are disposed to question the summary
G57 1320  2    characterization of the current generation as silent,
G57 1320  9    beat, apathetic, or as a mass of other-directed conformists
G57 1330 10    who are guided solely by social radar without benefit
G57 1340  7    of inner gyroscopes. Our data indicate that these students
G57 1350  5    of today do basically accept the existing institutions
G57 1360  2    of the society, and, in the face of the realities of
G57 1360 13    complex and large-scale economic and political problems,
G57 1370  8    make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those
G57 1380  7    who occupy positions of legitimized responsibility
G57 1390  2    for coping with such collective concerns. In a real
G57 1400  3    sense they are admittedly conservative, but their conservatism
G57 1410  1    incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original
G57 1410  8    "radicalism" of 1776. Although we have no measures
G57 1420  8    of its strength or intensity, the heritage of the doctrine
G57 1430  6    of inalienable rights is retained. As they move through
G57 1440  5    the college years our young men and women are "socialized"
G57 1450  1    into a broadly similar culture, at the level of personal
G57 1460  1    behavior. In this sense also, they are surely conformists.
G57 1460 10    It is even true that some among them use the sheer
G57 1470 10    fact of conformity- "everyone does it"- as a criterion
G57 1480  6    for conduct. But the extent of ethical robotism is
G57 1490  4    easily overestimated. Few students are really so faceless
G57 1500  2    in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population
G57 1500 12    in our institutions of higher learning. And it may
G57 1510  8    be well to recall that to say "conformity" is, in part,
G57 1520  5    another way of saying "orderly human society".
G57 1530  2       In the field of religious beliefs and values, the
G57 1540  1    college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding
G57 1540  9    culture. Their commitments are, for the most part,
G57 1550  8    couched in a familiar idiom. Students testify to a
G57 1560  5    felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal
G57 1570  2    philosophy. Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so
G57 1570  9    rare as to be a curiosity. The religious quest is often
G57 1580 10    intense and deep, and there are students on every campus
G57 1590  8    who are seriously wrestling with the most profound
G57 1600  4    questions of meaning and value. At the same time, a
G57 1610  2    major proportion of these young men and women see religion
G57 1610 12    as a means of personal adjustment, an anchor for family
G57 1620  8    life, a source of emotional security. These personal
G57 1630  4    and social goals often overshadow the goals of intellectual
G57 1640  4    clarity, and spiritual transcendence. The "cult of
G57 1650  2    adjustment" does exist. It exists alongside the acceptance
G57 1650 10    of traditional forms of organized religion (church,
G57 1660  7    ordained personnel, ritual, dogma). Still another segment
G57 1670  6    of the student population consists of those who seek,
G57 1680  5    in what they regard as religion, intellectual clarity,
G57 1690  1    rational belief, and ethical guidance and reinforcement.
G57 1700  1       Our first impression of the data was that the students
G57 1700 11    were surprisingly orthodox and religiously involved.
G57 1710  5    Upon second thought we were forced to realize that
G57 1720  5    we have very few reliable historical benchmarks against
G57 1730  2    which we might compare the present situation, and that
G57 1730 11    conclusions that present-day students are "more" or
G57 1740  8    "less" religious could not be defended on the basis
G57 1750  8    of our data. As we looked more intently at the content
G57 1760  4    of our belief and the extent of religious participation,
G57 1770  1    we received the impression that many of the religious
G57 1770 10    convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance,
G57 1780  6    of low intensity. But, here again, comparative benchmarks
G57 1790  6    are lacking, and we do not know, in any case, what
G57 1800  6    measure of profoundity and intensity to expect from
G57 1810  2    healthy, young, secure and relatively inexperienced
G57 1810  8    persons; after all, feelings of immortality and invulnerability
G57 1820  8    are standard illusions of youth. Nor are optimistic
G57 1830  6    and socially-oriented themes at all rare in the distinctive
G57 1840  6    religious history of this country.
G57 1850  1       Kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding
G57 1850  7    changes in values during a period of years, primarily
G57 1860  7    1935-1955, but extending much farther back in some
G57 1870  4    instances. A variety of data are assembled to bear
G57 1880  1    upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality,
G57 1880  9    work-success ethic, individualism, achievement, lessened
G57 1890  5    emphasis on future-time orientation in favor of sociability,
G57 1900  6    moral relativism, consideration and tolerance, conformity,
G57 1910  3    hedonistic present-time orientation. Although he questions
G57 1920  3    the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion
G57 1930  1    and the alleged increase in conformity, and thinks
G57 1930  9    that "hedonistic" present-time orientation does not
G57 1940  6    have the meaning usually attributed to it, he does
G57 1950  5    conclude that Americans increasingly enjoy leisure
G57 1960  1    without guilt, do not stress achievement so much as
G57 1960 10    formerly, are more accepting of group harmony as a
G57 1970  7    goal, more tolerant of diversity and aware of other
G57 1980  4    cultures.
