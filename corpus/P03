P03 0010  1       "Thrifty of her to use it up. Unusual in a case
P03 0010 12    like this, but"-
P03 0020  1       "You can joke! Didn't you read it? She's married
P03 0030  2    that tenant!"
P03 0030  4       "I read it, yes. This ought to simplify Tolley's
P03 0040  4    life".
P03 0040  5       Laban had more to say. Tolley had gone to live in
P03 0050  6    California. He'd mentioned it, himself, at church and
P03 0060  2    everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left
P03 0060 12    because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards. "It was
P03 0070  9    plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing
P03 0080  7    about it, Mamma. Zion stayed to get my pin, but it'll
P03 0090  7    be a cold day in June when I go back".
P03 0110  1       "We will both go back, Laban"! Kizzie turned to
P03 0110 10    go inside. "Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted,
P03 0120 10    Mamma. The sun's right"-
P03 0130  1       "Pictures"? She swung around. "What pictures"?
P03 0140  2       "In Brace's room! You told me to bring my camera.
P03 0150  4    I'm not going back"-
P03 0150  8       "Indeed you are! Why should I want pictures of an
P03 0160  8    empty room now? Tolley had no idea of marrying that
P03 0170  7    sneaky little Jenny! This- trip of his had nothing
P03 0180  4    to do with her consorting with tenants, and I am going
P03 0190  1    to see that everybody at Mt. Pleasant understands that
P03 0190 10    simple fact. Wait for me, Laban, I'll be dressed in
P03 0200  9    half a second"!
P03 0210  1       Frank followed her into the bedroom, hooked her
P03 0210  9    dress up the back.
P03 0220  1       "Hurry, Frank! They're not going to laugh at the
P03 0230  1    Fairbrothers and Labans very long! Tolley's going is
P03 0230  9    my fault. I drove him away. You know it and I'll tell
P03 0240 12    everybody exactly how it happened".
P03 0250  5       She was so beautiful, so valiant, so pitiable. He
P03 0260  4    kissed her. "Make your confession to God, Kizzie dear,
P03 0270  2    not to the congregation".
P03 0270  6       "I'll decide that when I get there. I was so cruel
P03 0280  8    to Tolley, so unfair. But I'll be fair now! He is coming
P03 0290  7    back, isn't he, Frank"?
P03 0300  1       Yes, oh yes. What else was there to say? Returning
P03 0300 10    to the log-house he found some favorite lines from
P03 0310  7    Jonathan Swift on his lips:
P03 0320  1       "Under the window in stormy weather
P03 0320  7       I marry this man and woman together.
P03 0330  4       Let none but Him who rules the thunder
P03 0340  1       Put this man and woman asunder".
P03 0340  7       Absolution for his lie? He questioned God's taking
P03 0350  5    time to telegraph the message, but he felt better about
P03 0360  5    Kizzie, and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole,
P03 0370  2    wondering why he had preserved it. If he died before
P03 0370 12    she did, she would never be unable to resist opening
P03 0380 10    it. In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his
P03 0390  8    remaining sons, making them parties to a deception
P03 0400  4    peculiarly his own. It was simply his necessity to
P03 0410  2    confess which had made him write and keep this thing.
P03 0410 12    "You've told God, Frank", he said. "Why lacerate the-
P03 0420  9    congregation"?
P03 0430  1       Reaching for an old clay pot, relic of pioneer days,
P03 0430 11    he tore the envelope in pieces, dropping them into
P03 0440  8    it, touching the little pyre to flame, watching it
P03 0450  6    curl, the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the
P03 0460  3    feathery ash. Surely now his beloved son could rest
P03 0460 12    in peace.
P03 0470  1       "'And let me go, for the night gathers me, and in
P03 0470 12    the night shall no man gather fruit'". A beautiful
P03 0480  3    and haunting line, a subtle genius, Swinburne, difficult
P03 0490  6    not to envy a gifted man, and perhaps he did ...
P03 0500  5       But there were great satisfactions, even for a small
P03 0510  3    man. Beyond his window were the greening trees, new
P03 0510 12    spring, eternal hope, eternal life. There lay Grand
P03 0520  8    Fair's Quinzaine, his own young parents' graves, but
P03 0530  7    new life and promise for his sons, grandsons. He poured
P03 0540  4    his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made so often.
P03 0550  3    "To absent loved ones". But this last time he drank
P03 0550 13    not to Brace but "To Tolley"!
P03 0560  6    #42#
P03 0560  7    MR. ROBARDS- Jenny was the only person she knew of
P03 0570  8    in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood who called him that-
P03 0580  5    was kind but too easygoing. It didn't bother him for
P03 0590  3    everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say,
P03 0590 12    "Howdy, Miss Jenny", adding a careless "Roy", but it
P03 0600  9    did her.
P03 0610  1       He could put a stop to it, she told him again and
P03 0610 13    again. Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar, and Dr. Dunne
P03 0620  8    P.G., and C'un Major Frank. Mr. Robards laughed, said
P03 0630  9    he'd feel a damn fool, plain-out couldn't do that even
P03 0640 11    to please her.
P03 0650  1       "You could try. And if I ever hear you say 'Mist
P03 0660  1    Laban' again I'll scream. And don't tell me you didn't
P03 0670  1    at church Sunday. I heard you"!
P03 0670  7       He really hadn't meant to, he assured her, but it
P03 0680  8    was plain to her that the importance of these small
P03 0690  4    things was lost on Mr. Robards. How strange it was
P03 0700  1    that he could give her this handsome house and carte
P03 0700 11    blanche as to its beautiful furnishings, and fail her
P03 0710  6    in- spiritual ways.
P03 0710  9       Another weakness- far more irritating than his manner
P03 0720  7    of speaking, which he made only token effort to change-
P03 0730  8    was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley's. Her
P03 0740  4    horse, rather. But Mr. Robards' now, oh my yes, indeed,
P03 0750  5    yes! He called her "the Mare" much as Mrs. Whipsnade
P03 0760  2    spoke of "the Queen, God bless her". ... He, with fifteen
P03 0770  2    or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots
P03 0770 12    out there in the barn, was reverent only of "the Mare",
P03 0780 10    "the Racin' Mare", the revolting Gunny.
P03 0790  5       For the first few months of their marriage she had
P03 0800  4    tried to be nice about Gunny, going out with him to
P03 0810  2    watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around
P03 0810 10    in her stall. And what had happened? Gunny invariably
P03 0820  7    tried to bite her. Nerves, Mr. Robards said, just a
P03 0830  6    nip anyway. "Stand back, Miss Jen, she's oneasy of
P03 0840  4    your scarf". Never, "Quit that, you sor'l devil"! Never
P03 0850  3    concern for his wife's nerves, or the danger that the
P03 0860  3    curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear
P03 0860 13    baby due in January. She musn't annoy Gunny whose foal
P03 0870  8    was due then too!
P03 0880  2       Listening for hours to his laments that the war
P03 0880 11    and "Mist Fair's" poverty afterwards had robbed the
P03 0890  7    mare of many a racing triumph, and to his predictions
P03 0900  6    of greatness for the procession of foals to come, Jenny
P03 0910  6    could look forward to years of conflict with an animal
P03 0920  3    who disliked her intensely and showed it. Gunny symbolized
P03 0930  1    so much that was unpleasant- Tolley, the indifference
P03 0930  9    with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood
P03 0940  8    now treated her and which she would die rather than
P03 0950  8    acknowledge to her husband, his lack of understanding
P03 0960  3    and sympathy in her present condition, her disgusting
P03 0970  1    swollen stomach.
P03 0970  3       Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards. Tillie
P03 0980  2    was a fine midwife and could get here quick, he suggested.
P03 0990  1    Jenny's aversion to having Dr. Dunne, a former admirer,
P03 0990 10    seemed silly to him, but he would humor her, get anybody
P03 1000 11    she wanted, the best never being too good for her.
P03 1010  7       The chances were against his being here to humor
P03 1020  5    her when her time came, she was sure. He would be in
P03 1030  2    the barn, or riding for the veterinarian! Night after
P03 1030 11    night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter, rubbing
P03 1040 10    her with quarts of expensive liniment, fussing over
P03 1050  5    her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe,
P03 1060  2    tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did
P03 1060 12    come to the house. Yet when the dear baby came, he
P03 1070 11    had Tillie over here in a jiffy, and was as attentive
P03 1080  8    and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over
P03 1090  5    as any husband could have been.
P03 1090 11       Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. Dunne, feeling
P03 1100  9    that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby
P03 1110  6    to turn into triplets. There was something not nice
P03 1120  3    about triplets, though their father seemed pleased,
P03 1120 10    showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the
P03 1130  8    son he wanted, saying, "You don't see triplets trippin'
P03 1140  6    down the pike ever' day, Miss Jen, hon. Rhyme 'em up
P03 1150  7    cute- Arcilla, Flotilla ..."
P03 1170  1       Edmonia for her mother, she said firmly, Jennifer,
P03 1170  9    for herself, and-
P03 1180  1       "Kezziah, for Miss Kizzie", he suggested. "She was
P03 1190  2    mighty good to you past times, an' this'll fetch her".
P03 1190 12    Now she must be thinking of a boy-name, something special.
P03 1200 11    Just wait till she saw the Mare's foal. Handsomest
P03 1210  7    colt in all Kentucky. Strong too, up on his legs when
P03 1220  7    he was an hour old. What about Royal Robards?
P03 1230  1       "Why don't you name him Jesus Christ!" She burst
P03 1240  3    into tears.
P03 1240  5       Roy was deeply distressed. He'd had no idea how
P03 1250  4    unhappy his sweet peach had been. Of course she wasn't
P03 1260  1    herself right now, but as her strength came back her
P03 1260 11    spirits didn't seem to rise with it. He had a good
P03 1270 10    idea why not. Those elegant "At Home" cards she sent
P03 1280  5    out, now she could wear her pretty clothes again, and
P03 1290  3    had the house all trimmed up, hadn't brought many callers
P03 1300  1    in two whole months.
P03 1300  5       Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come. So had Miss Shawnee
P03 1310  4    Rakestraw, full of criticisms about the changes here,
P03 1320  1    giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to
P03 1320 11    his Heavenly Rest last year, saying how much she enjoyed
P03 1330  9    her boarding house in town in inclement weather, was
P03 1340  5    looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer.
P03 1350  1       There was an idea. Miss Kizzie had been right snippy
P03 1360  1    ever since they were married, though you'd have thought
P03 1360 10    a namesake would have brought her round. Oh, she'd
P03 1370  7    come to see them once, left silver teething rings for
P03 1380  4    all of the trips. But when Miss Jen went over right
P03 1390  2    away to return the call, Miss Kiz couldn't have been
P03 1390 12    very cordial, for she'd come back before she hardly
P03 1400  9    had time to get there. More and more, these days, she'd
P03 1410  7    been driving that pretty little mare that looked like
P03 1420  5    her, over to Tillie's and Nick's- his own old square
P03 1430  3    frame box on posts, chickens and cats and pups under
P03 1430 13    the house, everybody friendly inside, making a to-do
P03 1440  9    over the babies dressed like dollies. Though he was
P03 1450  6    glad she got on well with his young folks, she ought
P03 1460  3    to be welcome at the finest house in the land, too.
P03 1460 14       It made him pretty hot under the collar, after the
P03 1470 11    idea Miss Sis had given him, to be told by Miss Kiz
P03 1480 10    that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer
P03 1490  4    and next, if you please, and that much as she regretted
P03 1500  3    it, they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards
P03 1500 12    and the children. She hoped they were well.
P03 1510  8       He didn't tell Miss Jen, but she must have got word
P03 1520  8    from the cook or nurse, who of course knew those Quinzaine
P03 1530  4    nigs, and she really took a fit. If he ever did such
P03 1540  3    a thing again she'd die of shame.
P03 1540 10       "Have a party an' leave 'em out, hon", he suggested.
P03 1550  9    "A swell party, send an invite to ever'body but them-
P03 1560  8    those folks you met at the Galt House, the ones I've
P03 1570  8    got to know in this new Jockey Club affair, the whole
P03 1580  5    dang neighborhood. We'll have oystchers- couple bar'l
P03 1590  3    oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time. I'll see word
P03 1600  2    gets round".
P03 1600  4       "Don't you dare!"
P03 1600  7       Miss Jen was funny that way, funny that she didn't
P03 1610  8    seem to take to his ideas and perk up. He was downright
P03 1620  6    worried about her, but there was one more thing he
P03 1630  3    could try ...
P03 1630  6       Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside
P03 1640  3    her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking
P03 1660  1    home from the country school where she was teaching
P03 1660 10    now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some
P03 1670  9    mountain town.
P03 1670 11       Roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his
P03 1680 12    hat most politely, told her to hop in, and he'd give
P03 1690  9    her a lift to Quinzaine. Her hesitation was only momentary
P03 1700  4    and she hoped he didn't notice it, as she settled herself,
P03 1710  3    asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting
P03 1720  2    on.
P03 1720  3       "See for yourself, Miss Zion. It won't take a minute".
P03 1730  3    He swung in through his own wide gateway. "Them's the
P03 1740  2    purtiest babes you ever did see, but Miss Jen gets
P03 1740 12    mighty lonesome. She'll relish the sight of a friendly
P03 1750  8    face. Miss Kiz won't care your comin', will she"?
P03 1760  6       "Why of course not", Zion said uncomfortably.
