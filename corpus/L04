L04 0010  1    His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard. His
L04 0010 11    small, mean eyes regarded Marty steadily, unblinkingly.
L04 0020  5    His eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as
L04 0030  5    if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them.
L04 0040  2    As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath, Marty
L04 0040 12    smelt the reek of bad whiskey.
L04 0050  6       Marty recognized the man. He had driven the car
L04 0060  3    that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place.
L04 0070  1    This was Acey Squire, proprietor of the juke joint.
L04 0070 10       Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said, "There
L04 0080  8    was a cab waiting for me here. Do you know where it
L04 0090  8    might have gone"?
L04 0090 11       Squire chewed his gum, his jaw moving in a steady
L04 0100  9    rhythm. He looked straight at Marty. He did not answer.
L04 0110  7    Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him,
L04 0120  3    looked into their staring eyes.
L04 0120  8       "Did anyone see my cab"? he asked, keeping his voice
L04 0130  8    casual.
L04 0130  9       He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when
L04 0140  7    no one answered him.
L04 0140 11       "I have to get back to Jarrodsville", he went on.
L04 0150 10    "I see there are some cars here. I wonder if one of
L04 0160  9    you gentlemen could drive me back to town? I'd be happy
L04 0170  6    to pay for the favor, of course".
L04 0180  1       The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a
L04 0180 11    moment longer. And then a startling thing occurred.
L04 0190  6    It was so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several
L04 0200  5    moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after
L04 0210  2    it had happened.
L04 0210  5       There was no word spoken, no apparent signal given.
L04 0220  3       Yet the men all moved at the same instant.
L04 0230  1       They piled into the waiting cars, motors roared,
L04 0230  9    the cars sped off.
L04 0240  1       The station wagon and the old Plymouth headed east
L04 0240 10    toward Jarrodsville. The Ford and the pickup truck
L04 0250  7    sped west toward Sanford's Run.
L04 0260  2       In seconds all four cars were out of sight.
L04 0270  1       Marty Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm
L04 0270 12    clouds gathered ominously in the sky again. From a
L04 0280  7    great distance thunder growled and broke the silence.
L04 0290  4       Land looked back toward the dilapidated house. He
L04 0300  2    thought he saw a pale face at a window. Perhaps it
L04 0300 13    was Dora May. Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't
L04 0310 10    hurt him.
L04 0320  1       There were other farmhouses nearby. Across the road
L04 0320  8    there was one no more than a hundred yards away. There
L04 0330  8    was another on this side, a little further down. There
L04 0340  4    were many more between here and Jarrodsville. Telephone
L04 0350  2    poles lined the road. They reared tall and mocking.
L04 0350 11    Their wires stretched out into infinity. Not a single
L04 0360  9    strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside
L04 0370  6    the red-clay road.
L04 0370 10       There was nothing he could do but walk. And Jarrodsville
L04 0380  9    was more than three miles away, down an old dirt road
L04 0390  8    that the rain had turned into a quagmire.
L04 0400  1       Marty faced east and started walking down the left
L04 0400 10    side of the road. After he had proceeded a few feet,
L04 0410 11    he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers,
L04 0420  7    which were already damp and mud-caked. The viscous
L04 0430  3    mud was ankle-deep, and in places great puddles spread
L04 0430 13    across the road and reflected the murky light.
L04 0440  8       As he approached the first farmhouse, thunder sounded
L04 0450  6    behind him again, closer now and louder, like a steadily
L04 0460  5    advancing drum corps. There were several people on
L04 0470  2    the porch of the farmhouse. There was a very old man
L04 0470 13    and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from
L04 0480  9    toddlers to teen-agers. For just an instant he thought
L04 0490  7    of appealing to them for help. Perhaps they had a car
L04 0500  5    or truck and would drive him into town. Then he realized
L04 0510  1    the utter futility of the idea. They were staring at
L04 0510 11    him in the same blank and menacing way that the men
L04 0520  8    outside the gate had stared. Even the eyes of the smallest
L04 0530  6    children seemed malicious.
L04 0530  9       On his side of the road there were two farm hands,
L04 0540 10    well back in a field, leaning against a plow. They,
L04 0550  5    too, stared at him.
L04 0550  9       The drums of thunder were right behind him now.
L04 0560  7       A foolish thought came into his head. He remembered
L04 0570  5    a story he had read as a youth. It was probably one
L04 0580  2    of Kipling's tales of the British Army. It concerned
L04 0580 11    an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out.
L04 0590  8    The steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him
L04 0600  5    as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he
L04 0610  4    had commanded, and each man about-faced and turned
L04 0610 13    his back as the officer approached. Marty wished these
L04 0620  8    poor farm people would turn their backs.
L04 0630  4       The fencing by the roadside ended. Now the dirt
L04 0640  2    highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep
L04 0640 12    drainage ditch, too broad to leap over unless you were
L04 0650  9    an Olympic star. The day's rain had been added to the
L04 0660  7    stagnant water. He was trapped on the road when he
L04 0670  4    heard the sound of an approaching car. It was coming
L04 0670 14    toward him. The car was now in sight. Marty's heart
L04 0680 10    skipped a beat when he recognized it. It was the station
L04 0690  8    wagon that had passed his cab on the road, the station
L04 0700  6    wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm. Acey
L04 0710  2    Squire's station wagon. It had headed back toward Jarrodsville.
L04 0720  1    That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted
L04 0720 14    road. Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek
L04 0730 10    him out.
L04 0740  1       The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred
L04 0740 12    feet in front of him, beside a fenced field. Then there
L04 0750  8    was another sound. A second car was coming from the
L04 0760  6    west, from the direction of Sanford's Run. It was the
L04 0770  4    Ford that had been outside Burch's farm.
L04 0770 11       Marty looked helplessly in both directions. It was
L04 0780  8    a narrow road, barely wide enough for two cars to pass.
L04 0790  8    He could not leave the road because of the water-filled
L04 0800  5    drainage ditch. When the two cars were equidistant
L04 0810  1    from him, the station wagon started up again and the
L04 0810 11    Ford gathered speed. They bore down on him. There was
L04 0820  9    nothing he could do except jump into the ditch.
L04 0830  5       He jumped, and sank to his knees in muddy water.
L04 0840  2       As the two cars roared by, there was a high-pitched
L04 0840 13    eerie, nerve-shattering sound. Marty knew how the Union
L04 0850  9    soldiers must have felt at Chancellorsville and Antietam
L04 0860  7    and Gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at
L04 0870  6    them, screaming the wild banshee howl they called the
L04 0880  3    Rebel yell.
L04 0880  5       For moments he stood in water, shivering and gasping
L04 0890  3    for breath. He had turned his ankle slightly, and it
L04 0900  1    pained him. The cars, with their load of howling men,
L04 0900 11    had disappeared in the distance. There had been two
L04 0910  8    more cars parked at the farm, a Plymouth and a pickup
L04 0920  6    truck. They would be coming for him next, bearing down
L04 0930  2    on him from both directions. And then the station wagon
L04 0930 12    and the Ford would seek him out again. He would be
L04 0940 11    harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches
L04 0950  7    time after time, all the way to Jarrodsville. He still
L04 0960  3    had three miles to go. Back East the more affluent
L04 0970  1    juvenile delinquents, who could afford hyped-up autos
L04 0970  9    instead of switch blades as lethal weapons, played
L04 0980  7    this same game and called it "Chicken".
L04 0990  2       He could not go through the fields. That way was
L04 1000  2    barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire
L04 1000 14    fence. He had to make for the section of road just
L04 1010 10    ahead that was bordered by the rail fence, the section
L04 1020  5    by the farmhouse. At least he could climb up on the
L04 1030  4    fence when his tormenters roared by again. The Admassy
L04 1030 13    place could not be far now. He would go in there, climb
L04 1040 12    through the window, and at least be safe for a little
L04 1050  9    while and able to rest. There was even a bare chance
L04 1060  6    that the phone had not been disconnected.
L04 1070  1       He did not dare climb back up to the road. He was
L04 1070 13    deep in water, but at least they could not reach him
L04 1080  8    there. He splashed on, mud sucking at his feet with
L04 1090  5    each step, until he reached the end of the drainage
L04 1100  1    ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed
L04 1100 10    the farm. He climbed back to the road, and he felt
L04 1110  8    utterly exhausted. He stood, panting, for a moment.
L04 1120  4    And then he saw something that he had not seen before,
L04 1130  1    and panic gripped him again.
L04 1130  6       The fence, his only refuge when the metal death
L04 1140  4    came roaring at him, was made of rails, all right,
L04 1150  1    but the rails were protected by a thick screening of
L04 1150 11    barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed
L04 1160  8    against it. He lurched on down the road despairingly,
L04 1170  3    because there was no place else to go.
L04 1170 11       He lost all sense of dignity. You could not stand
L04 1180  9    on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your
L04 1190  6    life was at stake. Probably people were watching him
L04 1200  3    from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse,
L04 1210  1    too, but he did not bother to look. He broke into a
L04 1210 13    dogtrot, breathing heavily, streaming with sweat. He
L04 1220  6    had to reach Admassy's place. It was his only sanctuary.
L04 1240  6    The fences on both sides of the road bristled with
L04 1250  3    the barbed wire. The fences stretched on endlessly.
L04 1260  1       And then he heard them.
L04 1260  6       And now he saw them.
L04 1260 11       The Plymouth was coming at him from the east, the
L04 1270 10    pickup truck from the west. They had timed it better
L04 1280  6    this time. They would reach him at almost exactly the
L04 1290  3    same instant. He stopped stone-still. If he backed
L04 1300  1    against the fence, one of the cars would brush him
L04 1300 11    as it passed, and he would be cruelly lacerated by
L04 1310  6    the wire.
L04 1310  8       He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply
L04 1320  6    stood there, waiting for them, a perfect target.
L04 1330  2       The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down
L04 1330 12    to the floor boards. They were coming on at reckless
L04 1340 10    speed for such old vehicles. They thundered at him.
L04 1350  6    He held his arms close to his sides and made himself
L04 1360  4    as small as possible. When the Plymouth neared, it
L04 1370  1    veered toward him and seemed about to run him down.
L04 1370 11    He forced himself to stay frozen there. If he moved,
L04 1380  8    he would be in the path of the other car. He thought
L04 1390  5    the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it
L04 1400  3    went by. In a fraction of a second the pickup truck
L04 1400 14    hurtled by on the other side.
L04 1410  5       The weird, insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated
L04 1420  2    again and echoed from the distant hills.
L04 1420  9       He did not leave the middle of the road. He did
L04 1430  9    not try to run. He trudged on, his aching eyes focused
L04 1440  5    straight ahead. He was nearing the Admassy house. He
L04 1450  3    was going to make it, he told himself. And then he
L04 1450 14    heard a car coming from the east, and he felt as if
L04 1460 12    he would break down and weep.
L04 1470  2       "Oh, no, not again", he said aloud. "Not again so
L04 1480  1    soon".
L04 1480  2       There was a new sound, a sound as piercing as the
L04 1480 13    Rebel yell, yet different. It was the sound of a siren.
L04 1490 11    Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white,
L04 1500  7    and he began to wave his arms frantically. It was the
L04 1510  5    prowl car from the sheriff's office.
L04 1520  1       The car drew up alongside him and stopped.
L04 1520  9       "Get in", Charley Estes said brusquely.
L04 1530  5       He staggered into the back seat and lay back, fighting
L04 1540  5    for breath. There was someone in front with the sheriff.
L04 1550  3    It was Pete Holmes, the cabdriver.
L04 1550  9       Pete turned around and said to Marty, "I guess you
L04 1560  9    think I'm a yellow-bellied hound. But there wasn't
L04 1570  5    no use in me staying there. I couldn't fight a dozen
L04 1580  4    or so of 'em. If I'd stayed, all that I'd have got
L04 1590  2    was four punctured tires and one busted head. Why didn't
L04 1590 12    you wait at the Burch house? You must've known I'd
L04 1600 10    gone to get the sheriff. I was lucky they let me go,
L04 1610 10    I guess".
L04 1610 12       The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car
L04 1620  7    around in a very narrow space. When it was finally
L04 1630  5    pointed east, he said, "You should never have come
L04 1640  2    out here alone. This is redneck country. Every man
L04 1640 11    in every one of these houses is a Night Rider.
