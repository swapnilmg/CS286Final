L12 0010  1    ANDY DID NOT SEE the newspapers the next day. Someone
L12 0010 11    on his staff- he suspected it was Ed Thornburg- intercepted
L12 0020 10    them and for this Andy was grateful.
L12 0030  5       He finally fell asleep around six in the morning
L12 0040  3    with the aid of a sleeping capsule, a crutch he rarely
L12 0040 14    used, and didn't awaken until early afternoon. Memory
L12 0050  8    flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the
L12 0060  8    sick feeling knotted his stomach.
L12 0070  1       Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day.
L12 0070  9    Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew
L12 0080  9    also, and those who had kidnapped him. But where? It
L12 0090  5    was still a very big world, despite all the modern
L12 0100  3    cant to the contrary.
L12 0100  7       Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall
L12 0110  4    door. He was dozing, perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten.
L12 0120  2    He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance. "Sorry,
L12 0130  1    Mr. Paxton. Nothing new. Lot of people waiting to see
L12 0130 11    you, though".
L12 0140  1       "Reporters"?
L12 0140  2       "Our own people. Questions about the show tonight".
L12 0150  5    Hub picked up the telephone. "Shall I let them know
L12 0160  4    you're awake"?
L12 0160  6       "I suppose. How's Lissa, do you know"?
L12 0170  4       Hub considered. "Some better. She's got plenty of
L12 0180  4    guts, Mr. Paxton. You want me to call her"?
L12 0190  1       "She expecting me to"? Hub shook his head so Andy
L12 0190 11    told him not to bother. The only reason for contacting
L12 0200 10    Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted. He could not
L12 0210  8    manage the former or expect the latter; they had nothing
L12 0220  5    to give to each other. The omission might look peculiar
L12 0230  3    to outsiders, but Andy could not bring himself to go
L12 0230 13    through the motions simply for the sake of appearances.
L12 0240  9       He had little time to himself, anyway. As the afternoon
L12 0250  8    sped toward evening, the suite saw a steady procession
L12 0260  7    of Paxton aides pass in and out, each with his own
L12 0270  4    special problem. Thornburg arrived with the writers.
L12 0280  1    They had spent the morning revising the act, eliminating
L12 0280 10    all the gay songs, patter and dancing with a view of
L12 0290  9    the best public relations. What remained lacked the
L12 0300  4    original verve but it was at least dignified, as befitting
L12 0310  3    the tragic circumstances. Raymond Fox reported that
L12 0310 10    the orchestra had hastily rehearsed "Cradle Song" in
L12 0320  8    case it was needed. Charlie Marble was back and forth
L12 0330  7    on several occasions, first to confer with Andy on
L12 0340  6    the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement-
L12 0350  1    they decided it was wise- and later to announce that
L12 0360  1    a prominent comedian, also an agency client, had agreed
L12 0360 10    to fill the casino's open date. And once Bake slipped
L12 0370  7    in, pale and drawn, last night's liquor still on his
L12 0380  6    breath with some of today's added to it. He asked if
L12 0390  4    there was anything he could do. Andy invented a job
L12 0390 14    to keep him busy, sending him ahead to El Dorado to
L12 0400 11    supervise last minute arrangements.
L12 0410  2       But from Rocco Vecchio, they heard nothing.
L12 0420  1       At last it was time to depart. Hub, nosing about,
L12 0420 11    spotted reporters in the lobby, so Andy was hustled
L12 0430  9    away quietly through the hotel's service entrance in
L12 0440  5    a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere.
L12 0450  1       They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel,
L12 0450 10    but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub.
L12 0460 11    El Dorado was surrounded by a mob. They overflowed
L12 0470  8    the parking lot, making progress by automobile difficult.
L12 0480  4    Long before he reached the protection of the stage
L12 0490  3    door, Andy was recognized. Word of his arrival spread
L12 0490 12    through the crowd like a brushfire. They surged around
L12 0500  9    him, fingers pointing, eyes prying. It was not a hostile
L12 0510  8    gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last
L12 0520  4    night's hero-worshippers. They had come not to admire
L12 0530  3    but to observe.
L12 0530  6       "It's worse inside", Thornburg informed Andy. "Skolman's
L12 0540  4    jammed in every table he could find. Under the heading
L12 0550  4    of it's an ill wind, et cetera".
L12 0550 11       Backstage was tomblike by contrast. Andy's co-workers
L12 0560  8    kept their distance, awed by the tragedy. But in his
L12 0570  8    dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read,
L12 0580  6    "We're with you all the way". It was signed by everyone
L12 0590  3    in the troupe. Andy couldn't help but be touched. He
L12 0600  2    instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks
L12 0600 11    to be posted on the call board.
L12 0610  5       Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been
L12 0620  3    sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently.
L12 0630  1    Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment.
L12 0630 10    Bake himself looked better; any kind of job was better
L12 0640  9    than brooding.
L12 0650  1       Andy told him, "Bake, I wish you'd talk to Skolman,
L12 0650 11    see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside.
L12 0660 12    It's just barely possible with this crowd that the
L12 0670  7    kidnapper wasn't able to get a table. I wouldn't want
L12 0680  6    him to miss the message".
L12 0680 11       "I'll try. Skolman isn't going to like it much,
L12 0690  9    though, giving away what he should be selling".
L12 0700  6       Skolman wasn't the only one who didn't care for
L12 0710  4    Andy's scheme. A short time later, Lieutenant Bonner
L12 0720  2    stomped into the dressing room. "I got a bone to pick
L12 0720 13    with you, Mr. Paxton. It's those damn loudspeakers".
L12 0730  8       Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying.
L12 0740 10    "What about them"?
L12 0750  1       "They're going to louse me up good. My men have
L12 0750 11    been here all afternoon, setting up for this thing".
L12 0770  9    Bonner explained that, with the nightclub's cooperation,
L12 0780  6    the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield.
L12 0790  5    Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the
L12 0800  4    audience, the reservation list was being checked out
L12 0800 12    name by name, and a special detail was already at work
L12 0810 11    in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible
L12 0820  6    lead. However, it was virtually impossible to screen
L12 0830  4    the mob outside, even if Bonner had manpower available
L12 0840  2    for the purpose. "I want you to have the speakers taken
L12 0850  1    out".
L12 0850  2       Andy sighed. "Seems like we're never going to see
L12 0860  1    eye to eye, Lieutenant. Didn't they tell you what I
L12 0860 11    wanted the p. a. system for"?
L12 0870  4       "Sure, I know. But it's such a long shot"-
L12 0880  3       "No longer than yours. What do you expect to get
L12 0890  3    tonight, anyway? You think somebody is going to stand
L12 0890 12    up in the audience and make guilty faces? Or have a
L12 0900 10    sign on his car that says, 'Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper'"?
L12 0910  5    Andy crumbled the script in his fist. "I can't stop
L12 0920  8    you from doing what you think is right. But don't try
L12 0930  6    to stop me, either".
L12 0930 10       "Someday", Bonner said, "you're going to ask us
L12 0940  8    for help. I can hardly wait".
L12 0950  2       "What you don't understand is that I'm asking for
L12 0960  2    it now".
L12 0960  4       But Bonner departed, still full of ill will. He
L12 0970  1    had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination;
L12 0970 12    he had to cling to routine, tested procedures. To act
L12 0980  8    otherwise would be to admit his helplessness. But,
L12 0990  4    admit or not, Bonner was helpless. The crime showed
L12 1000  3    too much planning, the kidnappers appeared too proficient
L12 1010  1    to be caught by a checklist.
L12 1010  7       Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock.
L12 1020  4    He stalled for a half-hour longer, hoping to hear something
L12 1030  3    from Vecchio about the ransom money. Bake and Shirl
L12 1040  1    Winter, on separate telephones, could not reach him
L12 1040  9    at any conceivable location in Los Angeles, nor could
L12 1050  7    they secure any clear-cut information regarding his
L12 1070  3    efforts.
L12 1070  4       Bake cursed. "The sweaty bastard's probably halfway
L12 1080  3    to Peru with our money by now". When no one smiled,
L12 1090  2    he felt constrained to add, "Just kidding, natch".
L12 1100  1       Thornburg popped in to advise, "Andy, Skolman's
L12 1100  8    sending up smoke signals. You about ready"?
L12 1110  6       "What's he complaining about"? Bake asked. "They're
L12 1120  5    drinking, aren't they"?
L12 1130  1       "No. We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight.
L12 1130 11    I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything".
L12 1140  9    Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard,
L12 1150  6    "They act more like a jury than an audience".
L12 1160  2       Andy said, "Well, I guess we can't wait any longer.
L12 1170  2    Hub, you stick by the stage door. If Rock shows up
L12 1170 13    during the number- or you hear anything- give me the
L12 1180 10    signal".
L12 1190  1       Shirl Winter said, "I'll stay on the phone, Mr.
L12 1190 10    Paxton. There's a couple of call-backs I can work on".
L12 1200 10       "You're a sweetheart- but leave one line open. He
L12 1210  9    may try to phone us". Andy passed into the corridor,
L12 1220  5    their "good lucks"! following him. It was what they
L12 1230  5    said before every performance but tonight it sounded
L12 1240  1    different, as if he really needed it.
L12 1240  8       They were right. The act, cut to shreds and hastily
L12 1250  7    patched together during the afternoon, had not been
L12 1260  4    rehearsed sufficiently by anyone. The result had nothing
L12 1270  1    of the polish, pace or cohesion of the previous night.
L12 1270 11    Here's where luck would normally step in. But this
L12 1280  8    was no ordinary show and Andy knew it. Whether he sang
L12 1290  6    well or badly had nothing to do with it. The audience
L12 1300  3    had come not to be entertained but to judge. Twenty-four
L12 1310  1    hours had changed him from a performer to a freak.
L12 1310 11       Within this framework, what followed was strained,
L12 1320  6    even macabre. Eliminating the patter and the upbeat
L12 1330  6    numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal
L12 1340  3    melancholy. The effect was as depressing as a gravestone,
L12 1350  1    the applause irresolute and short-lived. Yet Andy plowed
L12 1350 10    ahead, mouthing the inconsequential words as if they
L12 1360  7    possessed real meaning, and gradually his listeners
L12 1370  4    warmed to him. Their clapping grew more fervent; the
L12 1380  2    evening was still not beyond salvaging, not as a show
L12 1380 12    but for him as a person.
L12 1390  5       The worst was yet to come.
L12 1390 11       As Andy reached the finale of his act, a subdued
L12 1400  9    commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings.
L12 1410  5    Rocco Vecchio- a perspiring, haggard Vecchio- was standing
L12 1420  5    there, flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored
L12 1430  1    transport guards. Vecchio was nodding and pointing
L12 1430  8    at the large suitcase he held.
L12 1440  5       Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief. He
L12 1450  3    waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction. The
L12 1450 13    music died away discordantly. He drew a deep breath.
L12 1460  9    "Ladies and gentlemen, in place of my regular closing
L12 1470  7    number tonight, I'd like to sing something of a different
L12 1480  5    nature for you. Ray, if you please- the 'Cradle Song'".
L12 1490  3       He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept
L12 1500  3    across the audience. Nor could he blame them. This
L12 1500 12    particular song at this particular time could only
L12 1510  8    be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste, callous
L12 1520  5    exploitation beyond the bounds of decency. Having no
L12 1530  3    choice, he plunged into it, anyway, holding onto the
L12 1530 12    microphone for support.
L12 1540  3       "Lullaby and goodnight ..."
L12 1540  7       Hisvoice shook. For the first time in his life he
L12 1550 10    forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up
L12 1560  7    by humming the rest. He wondered if the audience would
L12 1570  3    let him finish.
L12 1570  6       They did; though contemptuous, they were still polite.
L12 1580  5    But when he was finally through, their scorn was made
L12 1590  3    apparent. Someone clapped tentatively then quickly
L12 1590  9    stopped. Otherwise, the silence was complete. As the
L12 1600  8    lights came up, Andy could see that a number of patrons
L12 1610  8    were already on their way toward the exit.
L12 1620  3       He stumbled off-stage. "My God", he muttered. "My
L12 1630  2    God".
L12 1630  3       Hub was there to support him. "It's okay, Mr. Paxton.
L12 1640  3    The money's here, all of it".
L12 1640  9       At this moment, all he could think of was what he'd
L12 1650  9    been forced to undergo. "Did you hear them? Do you
L12 1660  6    know what they think of me"?
L12 1670  1       "Bunch of damn jerks", Hub growled. "Who needs them"?
L12 1670 10       Thornburg patted his arm. "Sure, Andy, it'll be
L12 1680  9    all right. Nothing broken that can't be mended". The
L12 1690  8    words were hollow. Thornburg knew, better than any
L12 1700  5    of them, that a public image was as fragile as Humpty
L12 1710  3    Dumpty. All the king's horses and all the king's men
L12 1720  2    ...
L12 1720  3       Vecchio shouldered in. "I got it, Andy. God knows
L12 1730  1    how, but I got it. You'll never believe the places
L12 1730 11    I've been today. I practically had to sign your life
L12 1740  9    away, you'll probably fire me for some of the deals
L12 1750  7    I had to go for, but"-
L12 1750 13       Andy nodded dully. "It doesn't matter, Rock. We've
L12 1760  8    done our part".
L12 1770  1       He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned
L12 1770 10    to his dressing room. The usual congratulatory crowd
L12 1780  6    was conspicuously absent; the place had the air of
L12 1790  7    a morgue. Andy had no desire to linger himself but
L12 1800  2    Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite
L12 1800 12    the efforts of the police to disperse them.
