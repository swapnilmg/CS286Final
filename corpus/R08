R08 0010  2    PUERI AQUAM DE SILVAS AD AGRICOLAS PORTANT, a delightful
R08 0020  1    vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-Punic
R08 0020 10    War Rome. Marcellus, the hero, is beset from all sides
R08 0030  9    by the problems of approaching manhood. The story opens
R08 0040  6    on the eve of his fifty-third birthday, as he prepares
R08 0050  4    for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow.
R08 0060  1    Suddenly, a messenger arrives and, just before collapsing
R08 0060  9    dead at his feet, informs him that the Saracens have
R08 0070 10    invaded Silesia, the home province of his affianced.
R08 0080  6    He at once cancels the celebrations and, buckling on
R08 0090  4    his scimitar, stumbles blindly from the house, where
R08 0100  1    he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart.

R08 0100 11    THE ALBANY CIVIC OPERA's presentation of Spumoni's
R08 0110  5    immortal Il Sevigli del Spegititgninino, with guest
R08 0120  5    contralto Hattie Sforzt. An unusual, if not extraordinary,
R08 0130  5    rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue
R08 0140  3    of Prometheus from the rock by the U.S. Cavalry was
R08 0150  2    given last week in the warehouse of the Albany Leather
R08 0150 12    Conduit Company amid cheers of "Hubba hubba" and "Yalagaloo
R08 0160  9    pip pip"!
R08 0170  1       After a "busy" overture, the curtain rises on a
R08 0170 10    farm scene- the Ranavan Valley in northern Maine. A
R08 0180  8    dead armadillo, the sole occupant of the stage, symbolizes
R08 0190  8    the crisis and destruction of the Old Order. Old Order,
R08 0200  7    acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu Arapacis, the lovely
R08 0210  4    Serbantian import, then entered and delivered the well-known
R08 0220  4    invocation to the god Phineoppus, whereupon the stage
R08 0230  1    is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering
R08 0230 10    Gorshek priests, symbolizing Love, Lust, Prudence and
R08 0240  6    General Motors, respectively. According to the myth,
R08 0250  5    Old Order then vanishes at stage left and reappears
R08 0260  3    at extreme stage right, but director Shuz skillfully
R08 0260 11    sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects
R08 0270  8    by simply having Miss Arapacis walk across the stage.
R08 0280  7    The night we saw it, a rather unpleasant situation
R08 0290  3    arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo,
R08 0300  2    complaining- in ad-lib- that "it smelled". We caught
R08 0310  1    the early train to New York.

R08 0310  8    THE DHARMA DICTIONARY, a list of highly unusual terms
R08 0320  7    used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults.
R08 0330  4    It's somewhat off the beaten track, to be sure, but
R08 0340  4    therein lies its variety and charm. For example, probably
R08 0350  1    very few people know that the word "visrhanik" that
R08 0350 10    is bantered about so much today stems from the verb
R08 0360  9    "bouanahsha": to salivate. Likewise, and equally fascinating,
R08 0370  5    is the news that such unlikely synonyms as "pratakku",
R08 0380  4    "sweathruna", and the tongue-twister
R08 0380  9    "nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen"
R08 0390  1    all originated in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli
R08 0400  1    Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning
R08 0410  3    British "imperialism". The terms are fairly safe to
R08 0420  3    use on this side of the ocean, but before you start
R08 0420 14    spouting them to your date, it might be best to find
R08 0430 11    out if he was a member of Major Pockmanster's Delhi
R08 0440  4    Regiment, since resentment toward the natives was reportedly
R08 0450  4    very high in that outfit.

R08 0450 10    THE BREEZE AND CHANCELLOR NEITZBOHR, a movie melodrama
R08 0460  8    that concerns the attempts of a West German politician
R08 0470  8    to woo a plaster cast of the Apollo Belvedere. As you
R08 0480  6    have doubtless guessed already, the plot is plastered
R08 0490  3    with Freudian, Jungian, and Meinckian theory. For example,
R08 0500  2    when the film is only four minutes old, Neitzbohr refers
R08 0500 12    to a small, Victorian piano stool as "Wilhelmina",
R08 0510  8    and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that
R08 0520  6    informs us that this very piano stool was once used
R08 0530  4    by an epileptic governess whose name, of course, was
R08 0540  1    Doris (the English equivalent, when passed through
R08 0540  8    middle-Gaelic derivations, of Wilhelmina). For the
R08 0550  5    remainder of the movie, Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds
R08 0560  3    to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian
R08 0570  1    blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag. In
R08 0570 12    this manner, he seeks to expunge from his own soul
R08 0580  9    the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against
R08 0590  4    the English at Dunkirk. As we find out at the end,
R08 0600  4    it is not the stool (symbolizing Doris, therefore the
R08 0600 13    English) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian
R08 0610 10    blind. And, when the slat finally shatters, we see
R08 0620  7    him count the fragments, all the while muttering, "He
R08 0630  4    loves me, he loves me not". After a few tortuous moments
R08 0640  2    of wondering who "he" is, the camera pans across the
R08 0650  1    room to the plaster statue, and we realize that Neitzbohr
R08 0650 11    is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece
R08 0660 11    of sculpture. The effect, needless to say, is almost
R08 0670  6    terrifying, and though at times a bit obscure, the
R08 0680  2    film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the "repressed"
R08 0690  1    movie-goer.

R08 0690  4    THE MUSIC OF BINI SALFININISTAS, CAPITAL LP @63711-R,
R08 0700  5    one of the rare recordings of this titanic, yet unsung,
R08 0710  3    composer. Those persons who were lucky enough to see
R08 0720  1    and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov
R08 0720 12    Festival in August, 1916, will certainly welcome his
R08 0730  8    return to public notice; and it is not unlikely that,
R08 0740  7    even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years,
R08 0750  5    so has the erudite, ingenious SalFininistas passed
R08 0760  1    through his "purgatory" of neglect. But now, under
R08 0760  9    the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek,
R08 0770  7    Jr., a major revival is under way. As he leads the
R08 0780  8    Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra, Schlek gives a tremendously
R08 0790  4    inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut
R08 0800  2    concertos, including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza,
R08 0810  1    which was included at the conductor's insistence. A
R08 0810  9    major portion of the credit should also go to flautist
R08 0820  9    Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible "Indianapolis"
R08 0830  5    movement in the Baslot. Not only was Haumd's intonation
R08 0840  5    and phrasing without flaw, but he seemed to take every
R08 0850  4    tonal eccentricity in stride. For example, to move
R08 0860  1    (as the score requires) from the lowest F-major register
R08 0860 11    up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds, not
R08 0870  9    skipping, at the same time, even one of the 407 fingerings,
R08 0880  8    seems a feat too absurd to consider, and it is to the
R08 0890  6    flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout
R08 0900  2    the passage. We would have preferred, however, to have
R08 0900 11    had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing
R08 0910  9    at this and other spots on the recording, since it
R08 0920  6    mars an otherwise sober, if not lofty, performance.
R08 0940  1    As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down
R08 0940  8    by trite, heavy-handed, commercially successful musicals
R08 0950  4    and inspirational problem dramas, the American theatre
R08 0960  4    is going through an inexorable renaissance in that
R08 0970  3    nebulous area known as "off-Broadway". For the last
R08 0970 12    two years, this frontier of the arts has produced a
R08 0980 10    number of so-called "non-dramas" which have left indelible,
R08 0990  7    bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran
R08 1000  6    theatregoer. The latest and, significantly, greatest
R08 1010  2    fruit of this theatrical vine is The, an adaptation
R08 1010 11    of Basho's classic frog-haiku by Roger Entwhistle,
R08 1020  8    a former University of Maryland chemistry instructor.
R08 1030  5    Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness
R08 1040  5    (there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five
R08 1050  5    seconds to an hour and a half), the statement it makes
R08 1060  3    concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of
R08 1060 10    youth is profound and worthy of our attention. The
R08 1070  7    action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat
R08 1080  5    students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and
R08 1090  2    their collective and ultimately fruitless search for
R08 1090  9    a cup of hot coffee. They are relentlessly rebuffed
R08 1100  6    on all sides by a waitress, the police, and an intruding
R08 1110  6    government tutor. The innocence that they tried to
R08 1120  4    conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever
R08 1120 12    when one of them, asking for a piece of lemon-meringue
R08 1130 11    pie, gets a plate of English muffins instead. Leaving
R08 1140  6    the theatre after the performance, I had a flash of
R08 1150  6    intuition that life, after all (as Rilke said), is
R08 1160  2    just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee,
R08 1160 12    and that this unpretentious, moving, clever, bitter
R08 1170  5    slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the
R08 1180  6    American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired.
R08 1190  1       Aging but still precocious, French feline enfant
R08 1190  8    terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking
R08 1200  7    jaded old Paris again, this time with a sexy ballet
R08 1210  8    scenario called The Lascivious Interlude, the story
R08 1220  4    of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly
R08 1230  2    in love with a middle-aged steam shovel. A biting,
R08 1230 12    pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern
R08 1240  9    life, the piece has been set by Mlle Lagoon to a sumptuous
R08 1255  5    score (a single motif played over and over by four
R08 1260  6    thousand French horns) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul
R08 1270  3    Sartre. Petite, lovely Yvette Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac
R08 1280  2    engagingly.
R08 1280  3       Ever since Bambi, and, more recently, Born Free,
R08 1290  3    there have been a lot of books about animals, but few
R08 1300  3    compare with Max Fink's wry, understated, charming,
R08 1300 10    and immensely readable My Friend, the Quizzical Salamander.
R08 1310  7    Done in the modern style of a "confession", Fink tells
R08 1320  9    in exquisite detail how he came to know, and, more
R08 1330  8    important, love his mother's pet salamander, Alicia.
R08 1340  2    It is not an entirely happy book, as Mrs. Fink soon
R08 1350  2    becomes jealous of Alicia and, in retaliation, refuses
R08 1350 10    to continue to scrape the algae off her glass. Max,
R08 1360  9    in a fit of despair, takes Alicia and runs off for
R08 1370  6    two marvelous weeks in Burbank (Fink calls it "the
R08 1380  3    most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole
R08 1380 12    life"), at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts
R08 1390  9    Parkinson's disease and dies. This brief resume hardly
R08 1400  7    does the book justice, but I heartily recommend it
R08 1410  5    to all those who are engages with the major problems
R08 1420  2    of our time.
R08 1420  5       Opera in the Grand Tradition, along with mah-jongg,
R08 1430  4    seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback. In this
R08 1440  1    country, the two guiding lights are, without doubt,
R08 1440  9    Felix Fing and Anna Pulova. Fing, a lean, chiseled,
R08 1450  7    impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once
R08 1460  5    mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke, is
R08 1470  2    responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi's earliest,
R08 1470  9    most raucous opera, Nabisco, a sumptuous bout-de-souffle
R08 1480  6    with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly
R08 1490  8    reminiscent of the Mudugno version of "Volare". Miss
R08 1500  5    Pulova has a voice that Maria Callas once described
R08 1510  3    as "like chipping teeth with a screw driver", and her
R08 1520  3    round, opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective
R08 1520  9    of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie.
R08 1530  8       The Champs Elysees is literally littered this summer
R08 1540  6    with the prostrate bodies of France's beat-up beatnik
R08 1550  4    jeunes filles. Cause of all this commotion: squat,
R08 1560  2    pug-nosed, balding, hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre Bravado,
R08 1570  1    a Bogartian figure, who plays a sadistic, amoral, philosophic
R08 1570 10    Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico de
R08 1580  8    Mille Rossilini's endlessly provocative film, A Sour
R08 1590  6    Sponge. Bravado has been alternately described as "a
R08 1600  5    symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself" (De
R08 1605  3    Gaulle) and "a decadent, disgusting slob"! (Norman
R08 1620  1    Mailer), but no one can deny that the screen crackles
R08 1620 11    with electricity whenever he is on it. Soaring to stardom
R08 1630  9    along with him, Margo Felicity Brighetti, a luscious
R08 1640  5    and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet, turns in
R08 1650  4    a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic.
R08 1660  1       The battle of the drib-drool continues, but most
R08 1660 10    of New York's knowing sophisticates of Abstract Expressionism
R08 1670  6    are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation
R08 1680  5    of V (for Vindication) Day, September first, when
R08 1690  4    Augustus Quasimodo's first one-man show opens at the
R08 1700  3    Guggenheim. We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo's
R08 1710  1    work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic
R08 1710 11    validity and importance of the whole abstract movement.
R08 1720  8    And it is thought by many who think about such things
R08 1730  8    that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school
R08 1740  4    that started with Monet, progressed through Kandinsky
R08 1750  1    and the cubist Picasso, and blossomed just recently
R08 1750  9    in Pollock and De Kooning. Quasimodo defines his own
R08 1760  8    art as "the search for what is not there".
R08 1770  6       "I paint the nothing", he said once to Franz Kline
R08 1780  5    and myself, "the nothing that is behind the something,
R08 1790  1    the inexpressible, unpaintable 'tick' in the unconscious,
R08 1800  1    the 'spirit' of the moment resting forever, suspended
R08 1800  9    like a huge balloon, in non-time". It is his relentlessness
R08 1810  9    and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic
R08 1820  5    philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures
R08 1830  5    as "The Invasion of Cuba". In this work, his use of
R08 1840  4    non-color is startling and skillful. The sweep of space,
R08 1850  1    the delicate counterbalance of the white masses, the
R08 1850  9    over-all completeness and unity, the originality and
R08 1860  6    imagination, all entitle it to be called an authentic
R08 1870  4    masterpiece. I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished
R08 1880  2    this, and he replied that he had painted his model
R08 1880 12    "a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe
R08 1890  9    on the canvas", which was his typical tongue-in-cheek
R08 1900  7    way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity.
