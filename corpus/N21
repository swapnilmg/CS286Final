N21 0010  1       Sulphur, oil, and copra make the kind of tinder
N21 0010 10    any firebug dreams of. I suppose a Lascar sailor had
N21 0020  8    sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the
N21 0030  5    blaze. Now, roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke
N21 0040  2    and flames, the fierce heat quickly drove us to the
N21 0040 12    stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep, not
N21 0050  7    knowing what to do ...
N21 0060  1       The lifeboats were stuck fast. We couldn't budge
N21 0060  8    them. I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame
N21 0070 10    leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back.
N21 0080  5    He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the
N21 0090  3    shark-infested waters.
N21 0090  6       One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No.
N21 0100  4    3 which trembled violently in the davits. Brassnose
N21 0110  1    yelled: "Come on, Sommers, Max ... step on it, we got
N21 0120  1    a chance now. Heave on those ropes; the boat's come
N21 0120 11    unstuck".
N21 0130  1       We pulled and swore and yanked and wept, scraping
N21 0130 10    our hands until they bled profusely. The Bonaventure
N21 0140  6    was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare.
N21 0150  6    Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut
N21 0160  4    loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water.
N21 0170  1       Brassnose, Max and I leaped into the sea and swam
N21 0170 11    to the boat. "Let's get away fast", said Brassnose,
N21 0180  8    shaking water from his mop of bleached hair. "That
N21 0190  7    tub is going to explode all at once".
N21 0200  1       Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with
N21 0200  8    a roar of live steam, geysers of sparks and flames,
N21 0210 10    and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke. Dimly,
N21 0220  6    we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't
N21 0230  5    go back into that inferno.
N21 0230 10       Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five
N21 0240  7    inches of water. "Sommers, you bale while we row",
N21 0250  5    Brassnose commanded.
N21 0250  7       As best as I could determine, we were some 700 miles
N21 0260  7    west of New Guinea, in the Bismark Archipelago. Three
N21 0270  3    days previously, we had steamed past barren Rennell
N21 0280  2    Island in the distance. Now we peered anxiously for
N21 0280 11    any speck of land in the Pacific, for this interminable
N21 0290  9    bailing would have to stop soon. There were gigantic
N21 0300  7    blisters and rope burns on our hands; our muscles were
N21 0310  4    hot wires of pain.
N21 0310  8       Brassnose was strangely silent. The big man with
N21 0320  6    the whitened hair murmured something: his words sounded
N21 0330  3    as if they were in the Manu tongue, which I recognized,
N21 0340  1    having studied the dialect in my Anthropology VI class
N21 0340 10    at the University of Chicago.
N21 0350  4       He then said something which struck a chord in my
N21 0360  5    memory.
N21 0360  6       "God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga.
N21 0370  3    We'd be in real trouble then. I'd rather keep bailing-
N21 0380  3    or sink".
N21 0380  5       I was puzzled by the remark, then I recalled the
N21 0390  2    voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago
N21 0390 11    in a university lecture on primitive societies. He
N21 0400  7    had been speaking of this archipelago:
N21 0410  2       "Even when the islands were under German mandate
N21 0420  2    before World War I, Europeans gave Eromonga a wide
N21 0420 11    berth. The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike
N21 0430  9    women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century-
N21 0440  6    stone age amazons who live in an all-female, matriarchal
N21 0450  6    society which is self-sufficient".
N21 0460  1       I remembered, too, the jesting voice of a classmate,
N21 0460 10    Bobby Pauson: "But how do they reproduce, Dr. Griggs?
N21 0470  8    I'm sure that males have something to do with that
N21 0480  8    process"!
N21 0480  9       There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided
N21 0490  7    as Professor Griggs said dryly: "I see your point,
N21 0500  6    Pauson. Of course, males play a role there, but believe
N21 0510  4    me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on
N21 0520  3    Eromonga. Indeed, you wouldn't live long, for the females
N21 0530  1    either drive the men they've seized from neighboring
N21 0530  9    islands back to their boats after exploiting them for
N21 0540  8    amatory purposes, or they destroy them by revolting
N21 0550  4    but ingenious methods. In fact, one important aspect
N21 0560  2    of their very religion is the annihilation of men".
N21 0570  1       "I think I know what you mean, Brassnose", I said.
N21 0570 10    "I know something about Eromonga. Let's hope we come
N21 0580  7    to a safer place".
N21 0590  1       But we didn't. Three hours later, while we were
N21 0590 10    bailing desperately, a dot of land came into view.
N21 0600  8    Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with
N21 0610  6    his two linked thumbs: I recognized it as an ancient
N21 0620  3    Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil.
N21 0620 10       A half-hour passed; we had drifted closer. In a
N21 0630 10    voice so frightened as to seem not his own, the big
N21 0640  8    bo'sun's mate quavered:
N21 0650  1       "Tchalo! It is Eromonga- look hard, you can see
N21 0650  9    with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff".
N21 0660  9       I squinted at the looming shoreline. There was a
N21 0670  8    wooden tower or derrick there, something like a ski
N21 0680  5    jump; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully
N21 0690  3    constructed of logs. A fine example of engineering
N21 0690 11    in a primitive society.
N21 0700  4       "What is the scaffolding for, Brassnose"?
N21 0710  1       He made a sound of despair deep in his throat. It
N21 0710 12    was embarrassing to see strapping, blonde Brassnose
N21 0720  7    comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen.
N21 0730  7       "Aaa-ee! It is their tultul, the 'jumping platform'
N21 0740  5    of death. It is the last of the three tests of manhood
N21 0750  5    which the women impose, to discover if a male in worthy
N21 0760  3    of survival there. Often, I heard my uncles and cousins
N21 0760 13    speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul.
N21 0770 13    They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about
N21 0780  9    it from their fathers".
N21 0790  1       Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what
N21 0790  9    I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga, I was glad
N21 0800 10    to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three
N21 0810  6    bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea
N21 0820  5    and toward our craft.
N21 0820  9       I expected Brassnose- as a man with a strain of
N21 0830 10    Melanesian in his blood- to speak to them. But he had
N21 0840  5    turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked.
N21 0850  1       So, I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect
N21 0850 11    and said, "We greet you in peace. In ngandlu. My friends
N21 0860 11    and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire.
N21 0870 10    We are thirsty and hungry; our sore and burned hands
N21 0880  6    and arms need attention".
N21 0880 10       The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile
N21 0890 11    like a beacon on me. I noted that her full breasts
N21 0900  7    were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus
N21 0910  4    fruit in her blue-black hair.
N21 0910 10       She said, "My name is Songau and these girls are
N21 0920  8    Ponkob and Piwen. You are welcome to Eromonga. My people
N21 0930  5    await you on the shore. You shall have food, water
N21 0940  3    and rest".
N21 0940  5       Thirty minutes later, the outrigger grated on sand
N21 0950  3    and other girls, waiting on shore, rushed forward to
N21 0950 12    pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine
N21 0960 12    ropes to a large boulder. I saw a dozen or so other
N21 0970  8    outriggers moored there.
N21 0970 11       I looked. All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure
N21 0980 10    on this island vanished at the sight. There was a mound
N21 0990  8    of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the
N21 1000  6    big wooden derrick. Some had been there for years;
N21 1010  1    others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking
N21 1010 10    to them.
N21 1020  1       There was one object which sickened yet fascinated
N21 1020  9    me. This was also a corpse- a male, judging from the
N21 1030 10    coral arm bands, the tribal scars still discernible
N21 1040  5    on the maggoty face, the painted bone of the warrior
N21 1050  3    caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting
N21 1050 12    nose.
N21 1060  1       The body may have been two or three weeks' dead.
N21 1060 11    I looked with revulsion at the legs. They were shattered.
N21 1070  9    Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds
N21 1080  5    of flesh. The man must have leaped to his death from
N21 1090  4    the topmost rung of the tultul.
N21 1090 10       As if divining my thoughts, the girl Songau smiled
N21 1100  7    warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman
N21 1110  5    might use in describing her rose garden:
N21 1120  1       "This is our tultul, a jumping platform, maku. Later,
N21 1130  1    you shall know it better. Is it not well-made? Our
N21 1130 12    old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu
N21 1140 11    festival fifteen moons ago. It took thirty of our women
N21 1150  8    almost six moons to build this one, which is higher
N21 1160  4    and stronger than the old one. We are very proud of
N21 1170  1    it".
N21 1170  2       "You have every right to be", I replied gravely
N21 1170 11    in the Manu dialect, but my attention was fixed on
N21 1180 10    Brassnose, the biggest and strongest of us. He looked
N21 1190  7    as if he was going to keel over. I felt a queasiness
N21 1200  4    in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these
N21 1210  1    girls that we were afraid. Not so soon, anyway.
N21 1210 10       I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on
N21 1220  9    his shoulder and said heartily, hoping it would make
N21 1230  5    an impression on the women: "This one is the maku Frayne.
N21 1240  3    He speaks your language too, for he is the grandson
N21 1250  1    of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was
N21 1250 12    strong and cunning. The maku Frayne has inherited this
N21 1260  7    strength from his grandfather".
N21 1270  1       This was the worst thing I could have said. Brassnose
N21 1280  1    turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly,
N21 1280 10    "Sommers, you meddling Yank, you're a fool! They despise
N21 1290  8    males who brag of their strength; they destroy such
N21 1300  6    men with their damned tests. You've ruined me, blast
N21 1310  4    you"!
N21 1310  5       At first, I thought he was out of his head, talking
N21 1320  5    wildly like this. But a glance at Songau and the other
N21 1330  3    women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out.
N21 1330 10       The women's faces had hardened after my statement.
N21 1340  8    At a nod from Songau, four lithe and muscular girls
N21 1350  6    darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms.
N21 1360  5    The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle;
N21 1370  1    but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the
N21 1370 12    strongest male that ever lived.
N21 1380  5       Besides, terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality
N21 1390  2    and will. My last impression as they led him off to
N21 1400  1    a stockade was of his pale face
N21 1400  8       In the Manu tongue, "eromonga" means manhood- a
N21 1410  4    quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly
N21 1420  3    feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava
N21 1420 13    were imbibed. In the hut to which I was assigned- Max
N21 1430 11    had his own quarters- my food was brought to me by
N21 1440 10    a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed
N21 1450  4    to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases.
N21 1460  1       Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things.
N21 1460 11    For an anthropologist, loquacious old L'Turu was a
N21 1470  8    mine of information. Though I had a great dread of
N21 1480  8    the island and felt I would never leave it alive, I
N21 1490  5    eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its
N21 1500  1    women. (Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier
N21 1500 11    Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951.)
N21 1510  8       From L'Turu, I heard that until about 1850 the people
N21 1520  9    of this island- which was about the size of Guam or
N21 1530  8    smaller- had been of both sexes, and that the normal
N21 1540  5    family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here
N21 1550  1    with minor variations.
N21 1550  4       But in the middle of the last century an island
N21 1560  3    woman named "Karipo" seized a spear in the heat of
N21 1560 13    an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after
N21 1580  7    their men had fled. Miraculously, Karipo and her women
N21 1590  5    had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the
N21 1600  3    isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes, after considerable
N21 1610  1    loss of life on both sides.
N21 1610  7       Karipo was something of a politician as well as
N21 1620  5    a militarist. She quickly exploited the exalted position
N21 1630  2    she now occupied, by harassing the disorganized males
N21 1630 10    and even putting many of them to death. Within a decade
N21 1640 10    or less, few men were left and a feminist society had
N21 1650  8    sprung up.
N21 1650 10       "Karipo was great goddess, told our mothers that
N21 1660  7    men were not necessary except to father children",
N21 1670  3    the crone told me. "All men went away from here. Those
N21 1680  2    who stayed had to pass tests. Few passed". She cackled
N21 1680 12    with mirth, showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth.
N21 1690  9    "Karipo's women then named this place 'Eromonga'- manhood-
N21 1700  7    for just the strongest men could stay here. Come, I
N21 1710  7    show you".
N21 1710  9       The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing
N21 1720  9    where a small hut stood. In the shade of a palm tree
N21 1730  7    in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures
N21 1740  2    in a semi-circle on the ground.
