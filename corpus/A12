A12 0010  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A12 0010  3       - A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's
A12 0020  2    plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference
A12 0030  1    scoring after three games.
A12 0030  5       Time stands still every time Moritz, a 26-year-old
A12 0040  5    Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field. Although
A12 0050  1    he never gets to play while the clock is running, he
A12 0050 12    gets a big kick- several every Saturday, in fact- out
A12 0060  7    of football.
A12 0070  1       Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads
A12 0070 10    but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn
A12 0080  8    team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma
A12 0090  5    in the Cotton Bowl.
A12 0090  9       That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points
A12 0100  9    in 15 tries. He ran his string of successful conversions
A12 0110  6    this season to 13 straight before one went astray last
A12 0120  5    Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington
A12 0130  1    State.
A12 0130  2       Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right
A12 0140  1    halfback, the position at which he lettered on the
A12 0140 10    1956 team. But ask coach Darrell Royal what position
A12 0150  7    he plays and you'll get the quick response, "place-kicker".
A12 0160  5       A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford,
A12 0170  4    Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking. Last year,
A12 0180  2    when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't
A12 0180 12    get into a single game.
A12 0190  5       "This year, coach Royal told me if I'd work on my
A12 0200  4    place-kicking he thought he could use me", said Moritz.
A12 0210  1    "So I started practicing on it in spring training.
A12 0210 10       Moritz was bothered during the first two games this
A12 0220  9    year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right (kicking)
A12 0230  8    leg and, as a result, several of his successful conversions
A12 0240  4    have gone barely far enough.
A12 0240  9       Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a
A12 0250 10    result, he hopes to start practicing field goals this
A12 0260  5    week. He kicked several while playing at Stamford High
A12 0270  3    School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953
A12 0280  1    district game.
A12 0280  3       "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during
A12 0290  2    three years in high school", he said, "and made 26
A12 0290 12    in a row at one time. I never did miss one in a playoff
A12 0300 13    game- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my
A12 0310  9    last two years".
A12 0310 12       Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football
A12 0320 10    efforts were hampered by a knee injury. He missed the
A12 0330  8    1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee,
A12 0340  4    then played 77 minutes in 1956. His statistical record
A12 0350  1    that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine,
A12 0350 12    was far from impressive: he carried the ball three
A12 0360  7    times for a net gain of 10 yards, punted once for 39
A12 0370  6    yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.
A12 0380  1       He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned
A12 0380 11    two years later. But he was scholastically ineligible
A12 0390  6    in 1959 and merely present last season.
A12 0400  3       Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz
A12 0410  1    declared.
A12 0410  2       "Once you get the feel of it, there's not much to
A12 0420  2    it. I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick
A12 0420 14    and some of them can't seem to get the feel. Practice
A12 0430 10    helps you to get your timing down.
A12 0440  3       "It's kind of like golf- if you don't swing a club
A12 0450  4    very often, your timing gets off".
A12 0450 10       Moritz, however, kicks only about 10 or 12 extra
A12 0460  8    points during each practice session.
A12 0470  1       "If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead",
A12 0470 11    he explained. @
A12 0480  3    _FOOTNOTES:_
A12 0480  4       In their first three games, the Longhorns have had
A12 0490  3    the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent
A12 0500  1    ... their total passing yardage in three games, 447
A12 0500 10    on 30 completions in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards
A12 0510  8    short of their total passing yardage in 1959, when
A12 0520  4    they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries ... Tailback
A12 0530  1    James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total
A12 0530  9    for his brilliant sophomore season, when he netted
A12 0540  6    271 yards on 55 carries; he now has 273 yards in 22
A12 0550  7    tries during three games ... Saxton has made only
A12 0560  2    one second-half appearance this season and that was
A12 0560 11    in the Washington State game, for four plays: he returned
A12 0570  8    the kickoff 30 yards, gained five yards through the
A12 0580  6    line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before
A12 0590  3    retiring to the bench ... Wingback Jack Collins injured
A12 0600  1    a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll
A12 0600 11    be ready for Oklahoma ... Last week, when Royal was
A12 0610  9    informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's
A12 0620  6    top four in rushing, he said: "That won't last long".
A12 0630  5    It didn't; Monday, he had four Longhorns in the top
A12 0640  5    four ...
A12 0650  1       A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff
A12 0650 10    Monday, but attention quickly turned from Saturday's
A12 0660  7    victory to next week's problem: Rice University. The
A12 0670  5    Mustangs don't play this week.
A12 0680  2       "We're just real happy for the players", Coach Bill
A12 0690  1    Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy.
A12 0690 13    "I think the big thing about the game was that our
A12 0700 11    kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching
A12 0710  6    and kept the pressure on. It was the first time we've
A12 0720  5    been ahead this season (when John Richey kicked what
A12 0730  2    proved to be the winning field goal)".
A12 0730  9       Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as
A12 0740  6    "a good feeling, I think, on the part of the coaches
A12 0750  6    and the players. We needed it and we got it".
A12 0760  1       Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive
A12 0770  1    performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy
A12 0770  9    Gannon. Both turned in top jobs for the second straight
A12 0780  9    game.
A12 0780 10       "Nelson played magnificent football", Meek praised.
A12 0790  5    "He knocked down the interference and made key stops
A12 0800  5    lots of times. And he caused the fumble that set up
A12 0810  4    our touchdown. He broke that boy (Air Force fullback
A12 0810 13    Nick Arshinkoff) in two and knocked him loose from
A12 0820  9    the football".
A12 0830  1       Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons'
A12 0830  8    aerial thrusts in the late stages.
A12 0840  5       One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang
A12 0850  3    21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.
A12 0860  1       "As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it",
A12 0860 11    Meek said. "He timed it just right and broke through
A12 0870 10    there before the boy (halfback Terry Isaacson) had
A12 0880  6    time to turn around. He really crucified him ... he
A12 0890  4    nailed it for a yard loss".
A12 0890 10       The Air Force's, and the game's, final play, was
A12 0900  7    a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon
A12 0910  5    intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards.
A12 0920  3       "He just lay back there and waited for it", Meek
A12 0930  1    said. "He almost brought it back all the way".
A12 0930 10       Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback
A12 0940  8    Mike Rice, Meek expects the squad to be physically
A12 0950  6    sound for Rice.
A12 0950  9       "Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game", Meek
A12 0960  8    said. "He'll be out of action all this week. He got
A12 0970  7    hit from the blind side by the split end coming back
A12 0980  3    on the second play of the game. There is definitely
A12 0980 13    some ligament damage in his knee".
A12 0990  6       Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the
A12 1000  5    opener with Maryland.
A12 1000  8       "He's looking a lot better, and he's able to run",
A12 1010  9    Meek explained. "We'll let him do a lot of running
A12 1020  8    this week, but I don't know if he'll be able to play".
A12 1030  5       The game players saw the Air Force film Monday,
A12 1040  2    ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves
A12 1040 12    scrimmaged for 45 minutes.
A12 1050  4       "We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday",
A12 1060  3    Meek said, "and probably will have a good scrimmage
A12 1070  1    Friday. We'll work out about an hour on Saturday, then
A12 1070 11    we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week, then taper
A12 1080 10    off".
A12 1080 11       SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston
A12 1090 10    in a night game Saturday, Oct. 21.
A12 1100  4    #HUDDLE HEARSAY#
A12 1100  6    - Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday
A12 1110  6    at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford, who is undergoing
A12 1120  5    treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders'
A12 1130  4    38-7 loss to Texas A+M ... Because of its important
A12 1140  4    game with Arkansas coming up Saturday, Baylor worked
A12 1150  2    out in the rain Monday- mud or no mud ... End Gene
A12 1160  1    Raesz, who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU,
A12 1160 12    was back working out with Rice Monday, and John Nichols,
A12 1170  5    sophomore guard, moved back into action after a week's
A12 1180  9    idleness with an ankle injury ... The Texas Aggies
A12 1190  6    got a day off Monday- a special gift from Coach Jim
A12 1200  5    Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night,
A12 1210  2    but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett, shaken
A12 1220  2    up in the Tech game, would not play against Trinity
A12 1220 12    Saturday ... Halfback Bud Priddy, slowed for almost
A12 1230  8    a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle, joined
A12 1240  6    TCU's workout Monday.
A12 1260  1       The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their
A12 1260 10    third victory in four American Football League starts-
A12 1270  7    a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos- but their
A12 1280  6    visit will be a short one.
A12 1290  1       The Texans have two more road games- at Buffalo
A12 1290  9    and Houston- before they play for the home folks again,
A12 1300  9    and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet
A12 1310  5    the Bills just as they are developing into the kind
A12 1320  3    of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.
A12 1330  1       Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one
A12 1330  9    of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks,
A12 1340  5    apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National
A12 1350  6    Football Leaguers, M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb.
A12 1360  4       Rabb, the former Louisiana State field general,
A12 1370  3    came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday
A12 1380  1    and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory
A12 1380 12    over the Houston Oilers, defending league champions.
A12 1390  5       "Just our luck"! exclaimed Stram. "Buster would
A12 1400  4    solve that quarterback problem just as we head that
A12 1410  5    way".
A12 1410  6       Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself,
A12 1420  2    for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid
A12 1430  1    effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to
A12 1430 10    whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of
A12 1440  6    a top star, Jack Spikes, though he did the team's place-kicking
A12 1450  7    while nursing a knee injury.
A12 1460  1       "Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally
A12 1460  9    well", said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed
A12 1470 10    movies of the game. "In fact our whole defensive unit
A12 1480  8    did a good job".
A12 1490  1       The Texans won the game through ball control, with
A12 1490 10    Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes.
A12 1500  6       "We always like to keep the ball as much as we can
A12 1510  8    against Denver because they have such an explosive
A12 1520  2    attack", explained Stram. "They can be going along,
A12 1530  1    doing little damage, then bang, bang- they can hit
A12 1530 10    a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you
A12 1540  8    in trouble".
A12 1540 10       The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final
A12 1550  9    period against the Texans, but Dallas had enough of
A12 1560  5    a lead to hold them off.
A12 1560 11       The principal tactic in controlling the ball was
A12 1570  7    giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy halfback. He
A12 1580  3    was called upon 26 times- more than all of the other
A12 1590  1    ball-carriers combined- and delivered 145 yards.
A12 1590  8       The Texans made themselves a comforting break on
A12 1600  7    the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was
A12 1610  4    jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson, the speedy
A12 1620  3    halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it
A12 1630  2    for Dallas. A quick touchdown resulted.
A12 1630  8       "That permitted us to start controlling the ball
A12 1640  7    right away", said Stram, quipping, "I think I'll put
A12 1650  5    that play in the book".
A12 1660  1       The early Southwest Conference football leaders-
A12 1660  7    Texas, Arkansas and Texas A+M- made a big dent in
A12 1670  9    the statistics last week.
A12 1680  2       Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave
A12 1690  1    the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards
A12 1690 11    (1,065 rushing and 447 passing) a new SWC high.
A12 1700  8       Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards
A12 1710  6    passing (on 5 completions in 7 tosses) and a tough
A12 1720  3    defense to whip TCU, and A+M, with a 38-point bulge
A12 1730  2    against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play
A12 1730 12    since 1950. Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards,
A12 1740  9    the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards.
A12 1750  5       Texas leads in per-game rushing averages, 355 yards,
A12 1760  3    and passing 149 (to Baylor's 126), but idle Baylor
A12 1760 12    has the best defensive record (187.5 yards per game
A12 1770  9    to Texas' 189). A+M has the best defense against
A12 1780  7    passes, 34.7 yards per game.
A12 1790  1       Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on
A12 1790  8    the liveliness of baseballs currently in use, the major
A12 1800  8    leagues have ordered their own tests, which are in
A12 1810  5    progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
