E16 0010  1       HOTEI is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and
E16 0010 13    every inch a family boat. Menfolk can ride in the forward
E16 0020 10    cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view. Youngsters
E16 0030  7    can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin
E16 0040  6    which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for three,
E16 0050  2    galley and marine toilet. The gals can sun themselves
E16 0050 11    in the roomy aft cockpit. All are well distributed,
E16 0060  8    not crowded together near the stern. And with passenger
E16 0070  6    weight shifted forward, Hotei levels off for speed
E16 0080  4    under power of a Merc 800. The 80-hp motor drives
E16 0090  1    her at 25 mph with six aboard!
E16 0090  8       With only two aboard, Hotei does better than 27
E16 0100  1    mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed
E16 0110  2    even in a three-foot chop. She also banks into a turn
E16 0110 14    like a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside
E16 0120 10    to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small
E16 0130  8    cabin cruiser. Nor is she a wet boat. We've been out
E16 0131  4    in five-foot waves and stayed dry.
E16 0140  1       A lot of thought went into storage space construction.
E16 0150  7    There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit
E16 0160  5    for charts and other items. The cabin has several shelves
E16 0170  4    for small items and storage under the bunks for water
E16 0171  2    skiis, life jackets, etc. The aft cockpit has a **f
E16 0180  7    storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat.
E16 0190 10    On each side of the motor well there's storage for
E16 0200  5    battery, bumpers, line and spare props with six-gallon
E16 0210  3    gas tanks below. The well itself is designed to take
E16 0210 13    two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room
E16 0220 11    for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it.
E16 0230  7       Needless to say, you can't build Hotei in a couple
E16 0240  6    of weeks. Our building time was slightly over 400 hours-
E16 0250  4    but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom,
E16 0260  1    sink, head and hardware was under $800. A comparable
E16 0260 10    manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000. Consider
E16 0270  8    what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000
E16 0280  6    and your building time is well worth it. A Gator trailer,
E16 0290  3    Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.
E16 0300  1    This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but
E16 0300 11    it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in
E16 0310  9    a few years.
E16 0310 12       All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which,
E16 0320  8    in the dressed state you buy it, is about the 13/16-inch
E16 0330  8    thickness specified in the drawings. Therefore, the
E16 0340  2    lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens,
E16 0350  1    etc., on a table saw. Besides flathead bronze screws,
E16 0350 10    silicon bronze Stronghold nails (made by Independent
E16 0360  6    Nail + Packing Co., Bridgewater, Mass.) are used extensively
E16 0370  6    in assembly and Weldwood resorcinal glue is used in
E16 0380  6    all the joints.
E16 0380  9       Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings.
E16 0390  8    Start by laying out the six frames and the transom
E16 0400  5    on a level floor. Draw each outline in a different-color
E16 0410  1    chalk, one on top of the other. In this way you will
E16 0410 13    be able to detect any obvious mistakes.
E16 0420  7       The transom frame is made first with the joints
E16 0430  5    lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold
E16 0440  3    nails. After notching it for the keelson, chines and
E16 0441  1    battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to
E16 0441 10    it with glue and the same type nails. All frames are
E16 0460  5    butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are
E16 0470  2    glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again
E16 0470 12    using the one-inch, No. 12 nails. The frames are notched
E16 0480  8    only for the keelson and the chines. If notched for
E16 0490  7    the battens, they would require more work, be weakened
E16 0500  3    and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge
E16 0510  1    water could flow through. Nowhere in the boat do the
E16 0510 11    frames come in contact with the plywood planking.
E16 0520  6       The jig is erected after the frames and transom
E16 0530  4    are complete. This is an important step because any
E16 0540  2    misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment
E16 0540  8    in the hull as you advance in construction. Be sure
E16 0550  8    all members are parallel, vertical and level as required.
E16 0560  6       After the frames and transom are set up on the jig
E16 0570  7    and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide
E16 0580  1    mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch
E16 0580 11    thickness is used throughout) is butted between frames
E16 0590  8    one and two below the line of the keelson. The frames
E16 0600  6    are glued and screwed to this piece. The joints are
E16 0610  3    also reinforced on each side with small blocks set
E16 0610 12    in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed. It is
E16 0620  7    over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson
E16 0630  5    are spliced.
E16 0630  7       The keelson, made of two three-inch widths, is next
E16 0640  7    installed. The first piece is glued and screwed to
E16 0650  4    the frames and transom and the piece butted between
E16 0650 13    frames one and two. The second piece is in turn glued
E16 0660 11    and screwed to the first. Note, however, that it is
E16 0670  7    six inches shorter at the forward end. One-inch, No.
E16 0680  4    10 screws are used in both cases.
E16 0680 11       A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily
E16 0690 11    fastened to frame one. The stem is laminated from four
E16 0700  9    pieces. Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them
E16 0710  5    down the center of the thickness to make the four.
E16 0720  3    Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces
E16 0720 14    and bend them into place on the jig. The first two
E16 0730 11    pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson
E16 0740  7    and are glued and screwed to the brace between the
E16 0750  3    first two frames. The second two pieces lap over the
E16 0750 13    inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer
E16 0760 10    member. They're glued and screwed to the inner member
E16 0770  8    of the keelson. A number of C clamps hold the pieces
E16 0780  5    together on the jig until the glue sets.
E16 0790  1       All bottom battens are two inches wide. The side
E16 0790 10    ones are a half-inch narrower. The battens are carefully
E16 0800  6    fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all
E16 0810  5    frames. Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No. 10 screws are used.
E16 0820  3    Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks
E16 0820 11    and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many
E16 0830 11    of the side battens. With the exception of two battens,
E16 0840  7    all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed
E16 0850  5    after careful beveling. The chines go in the same way
E16 0860  2    except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch
E16 0860 13    wood for strength and easier bending.
E16 0870  4       Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can
E16 0880  4    be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a
E16 0880 14    simple jig. I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to
E16 0890 11    the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips. The
E16 0900  8    aluminum, flush against the battens, acted as a fairing
E16 0910  5    stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson
E16 0920  1    to the proper bevels easily. If you don't own a planer
E16 0920 12    and don't want to buy one, it's well worth renting.
E16 0930  9       The planking is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood
E16 0940  8    Royal Marine plywood. This can be obtained in 42-inch
E16 0950  7    widths 24 feet long. The 42-inch width leaves very
E16 0960  3    little waste. Four pieces are used. Plank the sides
E16 0960 12    first, using glue and one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold nails
E16 0970 10    at all battens, the stem and the transom. Another person
E16 0980  8    inside with a weight against each batten will help
E16 0990  5    in the fastening. The best procedure is to have a few
E16 1000  4    friends hold the planking in place while you mark it
E16 1000 14    off. Then trim the excess. I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig
E16 1010 11    made by Porter Cable for this job. It's good for cutting
E16 1020  9    all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade
E16 1030  8    at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like
E16 1040  4    a saber saw.
E16 1040  7       When cut, the planking is clamped in place for a
E16 1050  5    final and careful trimming. Then it is marked on the
E16 1060  1    inside where it comes in contact with the transom,
E16 1060 10    frames, keelson and all the battens. It may then be
E16 1070  8    pre-drilled for the fastenings. The next step is to
E16 1080  5    remove it and spread glue where it has been marked
E16 1080 15    at the contact points. Then it is replaced and fastened.
E16 1090 10    The bottom planking is applied in the same manner.
E16 1100  7       After planking, the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas.
E16 1110  6    The spray rails are first glued on the outside and
E16 1120  3    fastened from the inside with screws. Then the chines
E16 1120 12    are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.
E16 1130 11    Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails,
E16 1140 10    they are also rough-sanded in that area. The cloth
E16 1150  6    is laid on one half of the bottom at a time. A 50-inch
E16 1160  6    width is used on each side and it laps the keel line
E16 1170  1    by about three inches. Lay the cloth in place and trim
E16 1170 12    it to size. Then remove it and give the whole bottom
E16 1180  9    a coat of resin. When the resin has hardened, mix up
E16 1190  5    another batch with a pigment added if you wish. I used
E16 1200  3    bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before
E16 1200 11    adding the hardener. Using a cheap brush, coat one
E16 1210  9    side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the
E16 1220  7    cloth. When the cloth is smooth, apply another coat
E16 1230  3    of resin, spreading it with a paint roller. Be sure
E16 1230 13    it is well saturated and then allow it to harden.
E16 1240  9       When the whole bottom has hardened, use a disk sander
E16 1250  7    to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line
E16 1260  5    and near the spray rail. Then lay a three-inch-wide
E16 1270  1    strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom
E16 1270 11    to the point of the stem. Before the resin has hardened,
E16 1280  8    screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline.
E16 1290  5    This protects the bottom in beaching. Fiberglas materials
E16 1300  3    are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co., 1605 W.
E16 1310  3    Elizabeth ave., Linden, N. J. They will also supply
E16 1320  2    literature on application.
E16 1320  5       The hull is now turned over (with the help of about
E16 1330  7    seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced position.
E16 1340  2    I set it on the Gator trailer. I laid three layers
E16 1350  1    of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing
E16 1350 12    a bow eye at this time. For added strength, I also
E16 1360  9    fastened a small block on each side of every frame
E16 1370  6    and batten joint. Again, these blocks were set in resin-saturated
E16 1380  5    glass cloth and nailed.
E16 1380  9       After trimming off the excess on the frames and
E16 1390  8    transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at
E16 1400  5    a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.
E16 1410  1    This is made up of scraps left over from the sides
E16 1410 12    and bottom. These flaring parts really help to keep
E16 1420  8    the boat dry. When they're on, the top edges are planed
E16 1430  7    even with the sheer batten.
E16 1430 12       The sides of the motor well run from the bottom
E16 1440 10    battens to the top and from frame six to the transom,
E16 1450  6    forming a real strong transom brace. Note another piece
E16 1460  3    of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom
E16 1460 13    between these pieces.
E16 1470  3       The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood.
E16 1480  2    All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior
E16 1490  1    fir plywood. Most floor battens are glued and screwed
E16 1490 10    to the flooring. The exception is where the flooring
E16 1500  7    butts. These battens are glued and screwed to the frames.
E16 1510  6       With all deck battens in place, the bilge is cleaned
E16 1520  4    and painted up to the floor line. Use one coat of Firzite
E16 1530  2    and one coat of marine paint. Bottoms of the floorboards
E16 1530 12    are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in
E16 1540 10    place.
E16 1540 11       After the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed.
E16 1550 10    They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as
E16 1560  8    illustrated. The windshield glass is shatterproof and
E16 1570  4    Plexiglas is used in the cabin.
E16 1570 10       Inside, bunks are framed up and installed as indicated.
E16 1580  9    A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one
E16 1590  8    under a removable section of the port bunk. The sink
E16 1600  5    in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the
E16 1610  2    head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the
E16 1610 13    bulkhead above the sink. For padding the seats and
E16 1620  8    bunks, I used Ensolite, Type M. Lightweight, non-absorbent,
E16 1630  4    fire resistant and dimensionally stable, it is easily
E16 1640  4    bonded to the wood with contact cement. Available in
E16 1650  2    **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.
