C02 0010  1       Television has yet to work out a living arrangement
C02 0010 10    with jazz, which comes to the medium more as an uneasy
C02 0020 10    guest than as a relaxed member of the family.
C02 0030  4       There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that
C02 0040  2    an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time,
C02 0040 12    for example, could not be justified without the trimmings
C02 0050  8    of a portentous documentary. At least this seemed to
C02 0060  6    be the working hypothesis for "Chicago and All That
C02 0070  4    Jazz", presented on NBC-TV Nov. 26.
C02 0080  2       The program came out of the NBC Special Projects
C02 0080 11    department, and was slotted in the Du Pont Show of
C02 0090 10    the Week series. Perhaps Special Projects necessarily
C02 0100  5    thinks along documentary lines. If so, it might be
C02 0110  6    worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different
C02 0120  1    department- one with enough confidence in the musical
C02 0120  8    material to cut down on the number of performers and
C02 0130 10    give them a little room to display their talents.
C02 0140  5       As a matter of fact, this latter approach has already
C02 0150  3    been tried, and with pleasing results. A few years
C02 0155  1    ago a "Timex All-Star zz Show" offered a broad range
C02 0-160 10    of styles, ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to
C02 0170  8    the free-wheeling Dukes of Dixieland. An enthusiastic
C02 0180  6    audience confirmed the "live" character of the hour,
C02 0190  5    and provided the interaction between musician and hearer
C02 0200  3    which almost always seems to improve the quality of
C02 0200 12    performance.
C02 0210  1       About that same time John Crosby's TV series on
C02 0220  2    the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample
C02 0220 11    breathing space is one of the most sensible things
C02 0230  8    a producer can do. In an hour remembered for its almost
C02 0240  4    rudderless movement, a score of jazz luminaries went
C02 0250  2    before the cameras for lengthy periods. The program
C02 0250 10    had been arranged to permit the establishment of a
C02 0260  7    mood of intense concentration on the music. Cameras
C02 0270  5    stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups, then
C02 0280  2    considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble
C02 0280 10    work.
C02 0290  1       "Chicago and All That Jazz" could not be faulted
C02 0290 10    on the choice of artists. Some of the in-person performers
C02 0300  9    were Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee
C02 0310  7    Russell, Johnny St. Cyr, Joe Sullivan, Red Allen, Lil
C02 0320  6    Armstrong, Blossom Seeley. The jazz buff could hardly
C02 0330  5    ask for more.
C02 0330  8       Furthermore, Garry Moore makes an ideal master of
C02 0340  6    ceremonies. (He played host at the Timex show already
C02 0350  3    mentioned.)
C02 0350  4       One of the script's big problems was how to blend
C02 0360  5    pictures and music of the past with live performances
C02 0370  1    by musicians of today. NBC had gathered a lot of historical
C02 0370 12    material which it was eager to share. For example,
C02 0380  9    there was sheet music with the word "jazz" in the title,
C02 0400  1    to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold.
C02 0400 11    Samples soomed into closeup range in regular succession,
C02 0410  8    like telephone poles passing on the highway, while
C02 0420  6    representative music reinforced the mood of the late
C02 0430  4    teens and 1920's.
C02 0430  7       However well chosen and cleverly arranged, such
C02 0440  3    memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption
C02 0450  2    than an auxiliary to the evening's main business, which
C02 0460  1    (considering the talent at hand) should probably have
C02 0460  9    been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago
C02 0470  7    style.
C02 0470  8       Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip
C02 0480  8    of Bix Beiderbecke, but this view of the great trumpeter
C02 0490  6    flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted
C02 0500  3    out the entire glimpse. Similarly, in presenting still
C02 0510  1    photographs of early jazz groups, the program allowed
C02 0510  9    no time for a close perusal.
C02 0520  3       "Chicago and All That Jazz" may have wound up satisfying
C02 0530  3    neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.
C02 0540  1    By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era
C02 0540 13    and a showcase for today's artists, the program turned
C02 0550  7    out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either. Still,
C02 0560  5    the network's willingness to experiment in this musical
C02 0570  4    field is to be commended, and future essays happily
C02 0580  1    anticipated.
C02 0590  1       Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the
C02 0590  9    tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan
C02 0600  7    Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's
C02 0610  7    "Lucia di Lammermoor" Sunday night.
C02 0620  2       The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of
C02 0630  1    cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation
C02 0630  9    as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain
C02 0640  6    call following a fantastic "Mad Scene" created on her
C02 0650  5    own and with the help of the composer and the other
C02 0660  2    performers.
C02 0660  3       Her entrance in Scene 2, Act 1, brought some disconcerting
C02 0670  2    applause even before she had sung a note. Thereafter
C02 0680  1    the audience waxed applause-happy, but discriminating
C02 0680  8    operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed
C02 0690  6    signs of strain, her musicianship some questionable
C02 0700  3    procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization.
C02 0720  1    As she gained composure during the second act, her
C02 0720 10    technical resourcefulness emerged stronger, though
C02 0730  4    she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented
C02 0740  2    in years of performances of "Lucia". She topped the
C02 0750  2    sextet brilliantly.
C02 0750  4       Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that
C02 0760  3    it stopped the show midway in the "Mad Scene", but
C02 0760 13    the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary
C02 0770  9    performance unfolding at the moment. Miss Sutherland
C02 0780  6    appeared almost as another person in this scene: A
C02 0790  5    much more girlish Lucia, a sensational coloratura who
C02 0800  2    ran across stage while singing, and an actress immersed
C02 0800 11    in her role. What followed the outburst brought almost
C02 0810  8    breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her
C02 0820  5    mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today.
C02 0830  3       This big, flexible voice with uncommon range has
C02 0840  2    been superbly disciplined. Nervousness at the start
C02 0840  9    must have caused the blemishes of her first scene,
C02 0850  7    or she may warm up slowly. In the fullness of her vocal
C02 0860  6    splendor, however, she could sing the famous scene
C02 0870  2    magnificently.
C02 0870  3       Technically it was fascinating, aurally spell-binding,
C02 0880  3    and dramatically quite realistic. Many years have passed
C02 0890  1    since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable.
C02 0890  8    Her debut over, perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge
C02 0900  8    equally fine.
C02 0910  1       The performance also marked the debut of a most
C02 0910  9    promising young conductor, Silvio Varviso. He injected
C02 0920  5    more vitality into the score than it has revealed in
C02 0930  5    many years. He may respect too much the Italian tradition
C02 0940  1    of letting singers hold on to their notes, but to restrain
C02 0940 12    them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.
C02 0950  9       Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice. His
C02 0960  7    bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction.
C02 0970  4    The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments
C02 0980  2    no more than satisfactorily just as the old production
C02 0980 11    and limited stage direction proved only serviceable.
C02 0990  7       Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden
C02 1000  7    in 1959. (The first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on
C02 1010  4    Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia.) She has since
C02 1020  3    turned to Bellini, whose opera "Beatrice di Tenda"
C02 1030  1    in a concert version with the American Opera Society
C02 1030 10    introduced her to New York last season. She will sing
C02 1040  9    "La Sonambula" with it here next week.
C02 1060  1       Anyone for musical Ping-pong?
C02 1060  6       It's really quite fun- as long as you like games.
C02 1070  9    You will need a stereo music system, with speakers
C02 1080  3    preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart,
C02 1080 12    and one or more of the new London "Phase 4" records.
C02 1090 11    There are 12 of these to choose from, all of them of
C02 1100 10    popular music except for the star release, Pass in
C02 1110  5    Review (SP-44001). This features the marching songs
C02 1120  4    of several nations, recorded as though the various
C02 1130  1    national bands were marching by your reviewing stand.
C02 1130  9    Complete with crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes,
C02 1140  7    and sundry other touches of realism, this disc displays
C02 1150  5    London's new technique to the best effect.
C02 1160  1       All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and
C02 1160 10    detailed explanation of this new recording program.
C02 1170  7    No reference is made to the possibility of recording
C02 1180  4    other than popular music in this manner, and it would
C02 1190  3    not seem to lend itself well to serious music. Directionality
C02 1200  1    is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the
C02 1200 11    sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix, there
C02 1210  9    is excellent depth and dimension to the music. You
C02 1220  5    definitely hear some of the instruments close up and
C02 1230  3    others farther back, with the difference in placement
C02 1230 11    apparently more distinct than would result from the
C02 1240  8    nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones
C02 1250  6    farther back. This is a characteristic of good stereo
C02 1260  3    recording and one of its tremendous advantages over
C02 1260 11    monaural sound.
C02 1270  2       London explains that the very distinct directional
C02 1280  1    effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to
C02 1280 13    their novel methods of microphoning and recording the
C02 1290  6    music on a number of separate tape channels. These
C02 1300  3    are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active
C02 1310  1    co-operation of the musical staff and combined into
C02 1310 10    the final two channels which are impressed on the record.
C02 1320  8    In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have
C02 1330  5    even been recorded at different times and then later
C02 1340  3    combined on the master tape to produce special effects.
C02 1350  1       Some clue to the character of London's approach
C02 1350  9    in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact
C02 1360  8    that ten of the 12 titles include the word "percussion"
C02 1370  4    or "percussive". Drums, xylophones, castanets, and
C02 1380  3    other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably
C02 1390  1    well. Only too often, however, you have the feeling
C02 1390 10    that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments
C02 1400  9    lined up on one wall to your left and others facing
C02 1410  5    them on the wall to your right. They are definitely
C02 1420  1    in the same room with you, but your head starts to
C02 1420 12    swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of
C02 1430 10    a tennis court watching a spirited volley.
C02 1440  3       The Percussive Twenties (SP-44006) stirs pleasant
C02 1450  3    memories with well-known songs of that day, and Johnny
C02 1460  1    Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive
C02 1470  1    Moods (SP-44005). Big Band Percussion (SP-44002)
C02 1480  1    seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements
C02 1480 10    just didn't have so much character as the others.
C02 1490  9       There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all
C02 1500  6    of these recordings, apparently obtained at least in
C02 1510  4    part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies.
C02 1520  1    The penalty for this is noticeable in the big, bold,
C02 1520 11    brilliant, but brassy piano sounds in Melody and Percussion
C02 1530  9    for Two Pianos (SP-44007). All of the releases, however,
C02 1540  8    are recorded at a gratifyingly high level, with resultant
C02 1550  6    masking of any surface noise. Pass in Review practically
C02 1560  5    guarantees enjoyment, and is a dramatic demonstration
C02 1570  2    of the potentialities of any stereo music system.
C02 1580  1       Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic,
C02 1580  9    but not realistic.
C02 1590  2       Strange, but true- authenticity and realism often
C02 1610  1    aren't related at all.
C02 1610  5       Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood
C02 1620  3    is physically authentic- in fact, impeccably so. In
C02 1630  1    any given period piece the costumes, bric-a-brac, vehicles,
C02 1630 11    and decor, bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.
C02 1640  7       The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians
C02 1650  7    and research specialists who look to this matter. During
C02 1660  6    the making recently of an important Biblical film,
C02 1670  2    some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not
C02 1670 11    only of costumes and interiors, but of architectural
C02 1680  8    developments, sports arenas, vehicles, and other paraphernalia
C02 1690  6    were compiled, consulted, and complied with.
C02 1700  3       But, alas, the authenticity seems to stop at the
C02 1710  2    set's edge. The drama itself- and this seems to be
C02 1710 12    lavishly true of Biblical drama- often has hardly any
C02 1720  8    relationship with authenticity at all. The storyline,
C02 1730  5    in sort, is wildly unrealistic.
C02 1740  1       Thus, in "The Story of Ruth" we have Ruth, Naomi,
C02 1740 10    and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic.
C02 1750  7    But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline-
C02 1760  5    i.e., that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound
C02 1770  4    up with Boaz- the film version has little to do with
C02 1780  3    the Bible.
C02 1780  5       And in the new "King of Kings" the plot involves
C02 1790  3    intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced
C02 1790 12    to the Gospels.
C02 1800  3       Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow, director of
C02 1810  2    the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood
C02 1810 10    and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion
C02 1820 11    picture industry.
C02 1830  1       He talked about unauthentic storylines too. He intimated
C02 1830  9    that they weren't doing the country much good in the
C02 1840 10    Cold War. And to an industry that prides itself on
C02 1850  8    authenticity, he urged greater realism.
C02 1860  1       "in many corners of the globe", he said, "the major
C02 1870  1    source of impressions about this country are in the
C02 1870 10    movies they meet. Would we want a future-day Gibbon
C02 1880  8    or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies
C02 1890  5    as his prime source of knowledge? Yet for much of the
C02 1900  4    globe, Hollywood is just that- prime, if not sole,
C02 1900 13    source of knowledge. If a man totally ignorant of America
C02 1910 10    were to judge our land and its civilization based on
C02 1920  8    Hollywood alone, what conclusions do you think he might
C02 1930  6    come to?
