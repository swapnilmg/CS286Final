E22 0010  1       Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff
E22 0010  8    to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of
E22 0020  8    Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure, because
E22 0030  5    I admire the music of Prokofieff; and with sober purpose,
E22 0040  5    because the development of Prokofieff personifies,
E22 0050  1    in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet
E22 0050 13    Socialist Republics.
E22 0060  2       The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United
E22 0070  2    States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of
E22 0070 11    pranks and bonheur- and very capable as a professional
E22 0080  9    musician. These qualities endeared him to both the
E22 0090  7    musicians and the social-economic haute monde which
E22 0100  4    supported the concert world of the post-World War I
E22 0110  3    era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor
E22 0120  1    in America was, indeed, brilliant.
E22 0120  6       Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an
E22 0130  6    ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained
E22 0140  4    musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists,
E22 0150  1    it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists,
E22 0160  1    it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it
E22 0160 13    to Prokofieff? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century
E22 0170  9    ideas; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate
E22 0180  7    of the times; a brilliant piece de resistance? Certainly
E22 0190  4    its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon.
E22 0200  6       I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time
E22 0210  5    when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927. All
E22 0220  2    musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic,
E22 0220 10    some skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35
E22 0230 10    years ago). I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting
E22 0240  7    in his high-pitched voice: "... it may be a tour de
E22 0250  8    force, mais mon Dieu, can anyone take this music seriously"?
E22 0260  4       The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly, America took Prokofieff
E22 0270  4    and his Classical Symphony seriously, and with a good
E22 0280  5    deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge Koussevitzky,
E22 0290  2    gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances
E22 0300  1    in Boston, New York, and Washington, D. C., to which
E22 0310  1    he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole
E22 0310  9    nation. Chicago was also a welcome host: there, in
E22 0320  7    1921, Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the
E22 0330  4    Love for Three Oranges, and played the first performance
E22 0340  2    of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed,
E22 0350  1    a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war
E22 0350 11    victory years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations
E22 0360  8    and extravaganzas, enjoyment and pleasure: "The Golden
E22 0370  5    Twenties". We attended the premieres of his concertos,
E22 0380  5    symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, and performed
E22 0390  3    his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches;
E22 0400  1    we bought his records and played them in our schools
E22 0400 11    and universities. We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff
E22 0410  6    had won his rights as a world citizen to the first
E22 0420  7    ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.
E22 0430  1       Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by
E22 0430  7    Paris during the Twenties: the Paris which was the
E22 0440  8    artistic center of the Western World- the social Paris
E22 0450  4    to which Russian aristocracy migrated- the chic Paris
E22 0460  6    which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America-
E22 0470  1    the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky,
E22 0480  1    Cocteau, Picasso- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism
E22 0490  1    and ultramodern art- the Paris sympathique which took
E22 0490  9    young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy
E22 0500 10    enthusiasms.
E22 0510  1       So young Prokofieff was the darling of success:
E22 0510  9    in his motherland; in the spacious hunting grounds
E22 0520  6    of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting salons of his lovely,
E22 0530  5    brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety- excess and abandon-
E22 0540  4    world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color,
E22 0550  1    dance, design, and thought.
E22 0550  5       Meanwhile, three great terrible forces were coagulating
E22 0560  4    and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription
E22 0570  1    of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled
E22 0570  9    to his native land. The world exploded when Fascism
E22 0580  8    challenged all concepts of peace and liberty, and the
E22 0590  7    outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist
E22 0600  2    and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist
E22 0610  1    tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust,
E22 0610  8    a changing world occupied the minds of men; a world
E22 0620  8    beset with new boundaries, new treaties and governments,
E22 0630  4    new goals and methods, and the age-old fears of aggression
E22 0640  1    and subjugation- hunger and exposure.
E22 0640  6       In this changed world, Prokofieff settled to find
E22 0650  7    himself, and to create for large national purpose.
E22 0660  4    Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune proved
E22 0670  2    that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic
E22 0680  1    order fighting for its very existence and ideals in
E22 0680 10    a truculent world. Here, Prokofieff became a workman
E22 0690  6    in the vineyards of Socialism- producing music for
E22 0700  4    the masses.
E22 0700  6       It is at this point in his life that the mature
E22 0710  4    Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that such
E22 0720  2    a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed
E22 0720 10    the creative flair of a composer, especially one whose
E22 0730  8    works were so fluent and spontaneous.
E22 0740  1       But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment
E22 0750  1    of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature
E22 0750 12    of his early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his
E22 0760  9    intentions to serve his people: "I have striven for
E22 0770  6    clarity and melodious idiom, but at the same time I
E22 0780  5    have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the
E22 0790  1    accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely
E22 0790 10    what makes lucid, straightforward music so difficult
E22 0800  6    to compose- the clarity must be new, not old". How
E22 0810  6    right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural defection
E22 0820  2    of experimentation as an escape for those who dare
E22 0820 11    not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern
E22 0830 10    traditionalism. And with what resource did Prokofieff
E22 0840  6    back up his Credo of words- with torrents of powerful
E22 0850  4    music. Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty
E22 0860  2    between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony
E22 0860 10    and his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth
E22 0870  8    Symphony; or the Love for Three Oranges (gay as it
E22 0880  8    is) with the wonderful, imaginative, colorful, and
E22 0890  3    subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet, The Stone
E22 0900  3    Flower. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is
E22 0910  1    the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.
E22 0910 10       Of course, these works are not comparable, even
E22 0920  8    though the same brain conceived them. The early works
E22 0930  5    were conceived for a sophisticated, international audience;
E22 0940  2    the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life
E22 0950  3    for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's
E22 0950 11    music, young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"-
E22 0960 10    his craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes
E22 0970  6    his medium for the cause of experimentation per se.
E22 0980  6    In orchestration, he stretches the limits of instrumentation
E22 0990  5    with good judgment and a fine imagination for color.
E22 1000  3    His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.
E22 1010  1    His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic
E22 1010  9    dance tunes and love songs is captivating: witty, clever,
E22 1020  7    adroit, and subtle. His counterpoint is pertinent,
E22 1030  4    skillful, and rarely thick.
E22 1030  8       Also, it should be noted that the polytonal freedom
E22 1040  9    of his melodies and harmonic modulations, the brilliant
E22 1050  4    orchestrations, the adroitness for evading the heaviness
E22 1060  3    of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint were
E22 1070  2    not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular
E22 1070 12    historical dramas of the stage and cinema, where a
E22 1080  9    large, dramatic canvas of sound was required. That
E22 1090  4    Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally
E22 1100  3    routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that he
E22 1110  2    was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe.
E22 1110 12    Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue
E22 1120  9    and instability.
E22 1130  1       Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero,
E22 1130  9    who, by the force of his creative life, helped preserve
E22 1140  6    the main stream of tradition, to which the surviving
E22 1150  3    idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually
E22 1160  1    added and integrated.
E22 1160  4       At this date, it seems probable that the name of
E22 1170  3    Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History,
E22 1180  1    as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware
E22 1180  9    of the lure and danger of experimentation, and used
E22 1190  5    it as it served his purpose; yet was never caught up
E22 1200  5    in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics. Certainly,
E22 1210  2    it is the traditional clarity of his music which has
E22 1210 12    endeared him to the Western World- not his experimentations.
E22 1230  1       So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical
E22 1230  8    talents and harvest a rich reward from them. Nor can
E22 1240  7    anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better,
E22 1250  4    or even as well, under different circumstances. His
E22 1260  2    fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not.
E22 1260  9    Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity,
E22 1270  7    while Stravinsky (who leaped into fame like a young
E22 1280  6    giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness? I think
E22 1290  3    the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words:
E22 1300  1    "the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff
E22 1300 10    forged his new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music,
E22 1310  7    so difficult to compose", he shaped his talents to
E22 1320  6    his purpose.
E22 1320  8       When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting
E22 1330  7    scenes of many cultures, many salons, many dialectics,
E22 1340  3    many personalities, he tried to refashion himself into
E22 1350  2    a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate
E22 1350 11    cultures. Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction
E22 1360  8    by the life of his own people- by the compass of their
E22 1370  6    national ideas. But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes
E22 1380  6    of whatever culture he was reflecting. In all his
E22 1390  3    miscalculations,
E22 1390  4    Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming
E22 1400  3    that he could transform other composers' inspirations-
E22 1410  3    representing many peoples, time periods and styles-
E22 1410 10    into his own music by warping the harmony, melody,
E22 1420  7    or form, to verify his own experiments. Because of
E22 1430  3    the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic
E22 1440  1    materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant
E22 1440  9    Petruchka, his savage Sacre du Printemps, his incisive
E22 1450  8    Les Noces- the world kept hoping that he could recapture
E22 1460 11    the historical direction for which his native talents
E22 1470  7    were predisposed.
E22 1470  9       But time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's
E22 1480  9    admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra
E22 1490  7    firma. His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks
E22 1500  4    of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism,
E22 1510  1    Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism, Neo-Jazz,
E22 1520  3    Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently,
E22 1530  1    Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within
E22 1530  9    one composer! What a patchwork of proclamations and
E22 1540  7    renunciations! Meager and shabby by-products linger
E22 1550  6    to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist;
E22 1560  1    a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem
E22 1560  8    (The Star-Spangled Banner); a poor attempt to write
E22 1570  9    an idiomatic jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants;
E22 1580  8    his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be
E22 1590  7    used for popular American commercial songs! Stravinsky,
E22 1600  3    nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic
E22 1610  1    bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another,
E22 1610  9    searching for a home.
E22 1620  3       How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff
E22 1630  1    was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly
E22 1630 11    changing world without losing his particular force
E22 1640  7    and direction. In the process, his native endowments
E22 1650  4    were stretched, strengthened and disciplined to serve
E22 1660  3    their human purpose.
E22 1660  6       With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique,
E22 1670  4    he wove the materials of national heroes and events,
E22 1680  2    national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic
E22 1680  9    dances and love songs- into a solid musical literature
E22 1690  9    which served his people well, and is providing much
E22 1700  7    enjoyment to the World at large.
E22 1710  1       Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving
E22 1710 11    this historical feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources
E22 1720  7    of his people behind him; time and economic security;
E22 1730  6    symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies; choruses,
E22 1740  3    chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings; broadcastings;
E22 1750  2    television; large and eager audiences. It must be conceded
E22 1760  4    that his native land provided Prokofieff with many
E22 1770  1    of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive:
E22 1770  9    economic security and cultural opportunities, incisive
E22 1780  6    idioms, social fermentations for a new national ideology-
E22 1790  6    a sympathetic public and a large body of performers
E22 1800  4    especially trained to fulfill his purpose.
E22 1810  1       Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist
E22 1810  8    Republics produced one of the great composers of the
E22 1820  8    Twentieth Century. That his moods, even in his early
E22 1830  5    years, are those of his people, does him honor, as
E22 1840  2    his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered
E22 1840 12    every aspect of his medium according to his own great
E22 1850  9    talents and contemporary judgments, is a good and solid
E22 1860  7    symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures
E22 1870  2    of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;
E22 1880  1    and perhaps of even greater significance- his music
E22 1880  9    is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness
E22 1890  5    of Evolution, based on a broad Traditionalism for the
E22 1900  4    creative art of music.
E22 1910  1       April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical
E22 1910 11    history- indeed in the musical history of the entire
E22 1920 11    eastern United States. On that date the Musicians Emergency
E22 1930  7    Fund, organized to furnish employment for musicians
E22 1940  4    unable to obtain engagements during the depression
E22 1950  2    and to provide relief for older musicians who lost
E22 1950 11    their fortunes in the stock market crash, observed
E22 1960  7    its 30th anniversary.
