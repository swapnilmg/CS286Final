A43 0010  1       Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements
A43 0010  9    in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes.
A43 0020  7       Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems
A43 0030  7    clearly upward. Higher toll rates also are helping
A43 0040  4    boost revenues.
A43 0040  6       Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by
A43 0050  6    bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.
A43 0060  1       Things are looking up these days for many of the
A43 0070  1    State turnpikes on which investors depend for income
A43 0070  9    from their toll-road bonds.
A43 0075  2       traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.
A43 0080  1    That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and
A43 0080 10    quarters at toll gates.
A43 0085  2       As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors
A43 0090  1    who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked
A43 0090 10    as outright speculations are now finding new hope for
A43 0100  8    their investments.
A43 0105  1       Another result is that buyers are tending to bid
A43 0110  9    up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds.
A43 0120  4       Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments
A43 0130  2    hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard
A43 0140  1    + Poor's average. On balance, prices of those bonds
A43 0140 10    have slipped a bit since then. However, in the same
A43 0150  9    three-month period, toll-road bonds, as a group, have
A43 0160  6    bucked this trend. On these bonds, price rises since
A43 0170  2    February 21 easily outnumber price declines.
A43 0170  8    #TAX-FREE RETURNS.#
A43 0180  1    Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary
A43 0190  1    risk in the toll-road bonds. You find the evidence
A43 0190 11    of that in the chart on this page.
A43 0200  5       Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at
A43 0210  2    prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of
A43 0210 12    4 per cent, or very close to that. And this is true
A43 0220 10    in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have
A43 0230  5    risen close to, or beyond, the point at which the roads
A43 0240  3    start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest
A43 0240 12    on the bonds.
A43 0250  3       That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to
A43 0250 14    be had on good corporation bonds. It's not much more,
A43 0260 10    in fact, than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury
A43 0270 10    bonds.
A43 0270 11       For investors whose income is taxed at high rates,
A43 0280  9    though, a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high. It
A43 0290  8    is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor
A43 0300  2    with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for
A43 0310  1    a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income.
A43 0310 11    #SWELLING TRAFFIC.#
A43 0320  2    A new report on the earnings records of toll roads
A43 0320 12    in the most recent 12-month period- ending in February
A43 0330  9    or March- shows what is happening. The report is based
A43 0340  8    on a survey by Blyth + Company, investment bankers.
A43 0350  3       Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues
A43 0360  3    during the period.
A43 0360  6       And there is the bright note: The gains were achieved
A43 0370  5    in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960
A43 0380  3    and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.
A43 0380 13    Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe
A43 0390 11    winter.
A43 0390 12       Indication: The long-term trend of turnpike traffic
A43 0400  8    is upward.
A43 0410  1       Look, for example, at the Ohio Turnpike. Traffic
A43 0410  8    on that road slumped sharply in January and February,
A43 0420  6    as compared with those same months in 1960. Then March
A43 0430  5    brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues- after
A43 0440  4    operating costs.
A43 0440  6       As a result, the road's net revenues in the 12 months
A43 0450  5    ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest
A43 0460  1    payments on the turnpike bonds. That was up from 173
A43 0460 11    per cent in the preceding 12 months.
A43 0470  6       That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts
A43 0480  5    Turnpike. Operating revenues were off in the first
A43 0490  3    three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending
A43 0490 14    in March. Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.
A43 0500  9       For the year, the road earned 133 per cent of its
A43 0510 10    interest costs, against 121 per cent in the preceding
A43 0520  6    period. The road's engineers look for further improvement
A43 0530  2    when the turnpike is extended into Boston.
A43 0530  9    #SLOW SUCCESSES.#
A43 0540  1    Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long
A43 0540 10    enough to prove what they can do. The 187-mile Illinois
A43 0550 11    State Toll Highway, for example, was not opened over
A43 0560  7    its entire length until December, 1958. In the 12 months
A43 0570  5    ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough
A43 0580  1    to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the
A43 0580 12    remainder paid out of initial reserves. In the 12 months
A43 0590  9    ended in February, 1961, this highway earned 93 per
A43 0600  6    cent of its interest.
A43 0600 10       That improvement is continuing. In the first two
A43 0610  7    months of 1961, earnings of the Illinois highway available
A43 0620  4    for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early
A43 0630  3    1960.
A43 0630  4       Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard. Traffic
A43 0640  2    frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy
A43 0640 11    estimates. In these cases, the turnpike managements
A43 0650  7    have had to turn to toll-rate increases, or to costly
A43 0660  7    improvements such as extensions or better connections
A43 0670  2    with other highways.
A43 0670  5       Many rate increases already have been put into effect.
A43 0680  6    Higher tolls are planned for July 1, 1961, on the
A43 0690  4    Richmond-Petersburg,
A43 0690  6    Va., Turnpike, and proposals for increased tolls on
A43 0700  4    the Texas Turnpike are under study.
A43 0700 10    #EASIER ACCESS.#
A43 0710  2    Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists'
A43 0710 10    access to many turnpikes. The Kansas Turnpike offers
A43 0720  8    an illustration. Net earnings of that road rose from
A43 0730  8    62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957
A43 0740  4    to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28, 1961.
A43 0750  2       Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike
A43 0760  1    are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new
A43 0760 12    bypass at Wichita, and still later when the turnpike
A43 0770  7    gets downtown connections in both Kansas City, Kans.,
A43 0780  5    and Kansas City, Mo. Meanwhile, there appears to be
A43 0790  4    enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the
A43 0800  2    interest deficiency for eight more years.
A43 0800  8    #FOR SOME ROADS, TROUBLES.#
A43 0810  1    Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities
A43 0810  9    find that not all roads are nearing their goals.
A43 0820  9       Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have
A43 0830  6    been a great disappointment to planners and investors
A43 0840  3    alike. If nothing is done, the prospect is that that
A43 0850  1    road will be in default of interest in 1962. West Virginia
A43 0850 12    toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months, and,
A43 0860  8    despite recent improvement in revenues, holders of
A43 0870  5    the bonds are faced with more of the same.
A43 0880  1       These, however, are exceptions. The typical picture
A43 0880  8    at this time is one of steady improvement.
A43 0890  7       It's going to take time for investors to learn how
A43 0900  6    many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full. Already,
A43 0910  3    however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough
A43 0920  1    to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.
A43 0920  8    Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push
A43 0930  7    revenues up to the break-even point.

A43 0950  2    @ A top American official, after a look at Europe's
A43 0960  1    factories, thinks the U.S. is in a "very serious situation"
A43 0970  1    competitively.
A43 0970  2       Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges, accompanied by
A43 0980  3    a member of our staff, on May 10 toured plants of two
A43 0990  2    of Italy's biggest companies- Fiat, the auto producer,
A43 1000  1    and Olivetti, maker of typewriters and calculating
A43 1000  8    machines.
A43 1010  1       Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows-
A43 1010  9       "Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant,
A43 1020  7    and you learn this:
A43 1030  1       "One, modern equipment- much of it supplied under
A43 1030  9    the Marshall Plan- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars
A43 1040 10    a day. About half of these are exported.
A43 1050  6       "Two, wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs.
A43 1060  5    A skilled worker on the assembly line, for example,
A43 1070  3    earns $37 a week.
A43 1070  7       "Three, labor troubles are infrequent. Fiat officials
A43 1080  5    say they have had no strikes for more than six years.
A43 1100  4       "Said Secretary Hodges: 'It's a tough combination
A43 1110  2    for the U.S. to face'.
A43 1110  7       "Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges. Olivetti
A43 1120  8    took over Underwood, the U.S. typewriter maker, in
A43 1130  6    late 1959. Within a year, without reducing wages, Underwood's
A43 1140  4    production costs were cut one third, prices were slashed.
A43 1150  4    The result has been that exports of Underwood products
A43 1160  2    have doubled.
A43 1160  4       "The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout,
A43 1170  3    modern machinery. The firm is design-conscious, sales-conscious,
A43 1180  3    advertising-conscious.
A43 1180  5       "Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to
A43 1200  7    go to the U.S. The inflow of foreign capital would
A43 1210  5    help the U.S. balance of payments.
A43 1220  1       "Hodges predicted: 'I think we will see more foreign
A43 1220 10    firms coming to the U.S. There are many places where
A43 1240  6    we can use their vigor and new ideas'".
A43 1250  5    ##
A43 1250  6    @ Foreign competition has become so severe in certain
A43 1260  6    textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling
A43 1270  4    competitive imports.
A43 1270  6       The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the
A43 1280  6    international textile market can be significant for
A43 1290  3    American businessmen in many lines.
A43 1290  8       Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are
A43 1300  8    these:
A43 1310  1       An international conference of the big textile-importing
A43 1310  8    and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly
A43 1320  6    by President Kennedy.
A43 1330  1       Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth
A43 1330  9    noting.
A43 1340  1       The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized
A43 1350  1    countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed
A43 1360  1    countries over the years.
A43 1360  5       Point is that developing countries often build up
A43 1370  4    a textile industry first, need encouragement to get
A43 1380  2    on their feet. If they have trouble exporting, international
A43 1380 11    bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise
A43 1390 10    would.
A43 1400  1       Idea is to let these countries earn their way as
A43 1400 10    much as possible.
A43 1410  1    ##
A43 1410  2    @ At the same time, another purpose of the conference
A43 1420  1    will be to get certain low-wage countries to control
A43 1420 11    textile exports- especially dumping of specific products-
A43 1430  8    to high-wage textile-producing countries.
A43 1440  2       Japan, since 1957, has been "voluntarily" curbing
A43 1450  2    exports of textiles to the U.S. Hong Kong, India and
A43 1460  3    Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types
A43 1470  1    of textiles to Britain for several years under the
A43 1470 10    "Lancashire Pact".
A43 1480  1       None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.
A43 1490  1       The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S.
A43 1500  1    While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched
A43 1500 10    Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of
A43 1510  9    the big U.S. market.
A43 1520  1       Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their
A43 1520  8    exports to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles
A43 1530  8    pour into British market unrestrictedly.
A43 1540  4       The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar
A43 1550  5    restrictions on the British market for similar reasons.
A43 1560  3       The Kennedy hope is that, at the conference or through
A43 1570  3    bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries
A43 1580  1    in Asia and Europe will see that "dumping" practices
A43 1580 10    cause friction all around and may result in import
A43 1590  9    quotas.
A43 1590 10       Gradual, controlled expansion of the world's textile
A43 1600  7    trade is what President Kennedy wants. This may point
A43 1610  6    the way toward international stabilization agreements
A43 1620  2    in other products. It's an important clue to Washington
A43 1630  3    thinking.
A43 1630  4    ##
A43 1630  5    @ Note, too, that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward
A43 1640  5    modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry.
A43 1650  3       "Get competitive or get out". In veiled terms, that's
A43 1660  4    what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American
A43 1670  3    textile industry. The Government will help in transferring
A43 1680  2    companies and workers into new lines, where modernization
A43 1690  1    doesn't seem feasible. Special depreciation on new
A43 1690  8    textile machinery may be allowed. Government research
A43 1700  6    will look into new products and methods.
A43 1710  4       Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national
A43 1720  4    interest is involved.
A43 1720  7       But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import
A43 1730  4    quotas. Rather, they are impressed with the British
A43 1740  4    Government's success in forcing- and helping- the British
A43 1750  5    textile industry to shrink and to change over to other
A43 1760  2    products.
A43 1760  3       What's happening in textiles can be handwriting
A43 1770  1    on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing
A43 1770 10    with imports from low-wage countries.

A43 1780  7    @ Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S.
A43 1790  6    coal miners. Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make
A43 1800  5    foreign steelmakers' mouths water.
A43 1810  1       Steel Company of Wales, a British steelmaker, wants
A43 1810  8    to bring in Virginia coal, cut down on its takings
A43 1820  8    of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively-
A43 1830  6    especially in foreign markets.
A43 1840  1       Virginia coal, delivered by ship in Wales, will
A43 1840  9    be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered
A43 1850  9    by rail from nearby mines.
A43 1860  1       U.S. coal is cheap, despite high wages, because
A43 1870  1    of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams,
A43 1870  9    attactive rates on ocean freight. Many of the coal
A43 1880  8    seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting,
A43 1890  4    narrow and very deep.
A43 1890  8       Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the
A43 1900  9    British.
A43 1900 10       Welsh coal miners, Communist-led, are up in arms
A43 1910  9    at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American
A43 1920  7    coal. They threaten to strike.
A43 1930  1       The British Government will have to decide whether
A43 1930  9    to let U.S. coal in. The British coal industry is unprofitable,
A43 1940 10    has large coal stocks it can't sell.
