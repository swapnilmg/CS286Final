E04 0010  1       THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's Trout Quintet-
E04 0020  3    its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make
E04 0020 10    it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners.
E04 0030  9    But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers,
E04 0040  7    the work presents its problems. Since it requires only
E04 0050  5    five players, it would seem to fall into the category
E04 0060  2    of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an
E04 0060 13    instrument generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover,
E04 0070  6    the piece is written in five movements, rather than
E04 0080  6    the conventional four of most quintets, and this gives
E04 0090  4    the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.
E04 0090 11       The many and frequent performances of the Trout
E04 0100  8    serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing.
E04 0110  7    Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions, with the
E04 0120  3    contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present
E04 0130  1    the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these
E04 0130 10    readings, the double bass is either kept discreetly
E04 0140  8    in the background, or it is dressed in clown's attire-
E04 0150  6    the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop. Recently
E04 0160  5    I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, when
E04 0170  2    in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened
E04 0170 12    to no fewer than ten different performances. The occasion
E04 0180  7    for this marathon: Angel's long-awaited reissue in
E04 0190  6    its "Great Recordings of the Century" series of the
E04 0200  5    Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at the outset
E04 0210  3    that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing
E04 0210 13    as it did on the first.
E04 0220  6       Whether considered alone or in relation to other
E04 0230  3    editions, COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.
E04 0240  1    Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart
E04 0250  1    players of all time, and any commentary of his on this
E04 0250 12    repertory is valuable. But Schnabel was a great teacher
E04 0260  7    in addition to being a great performer, and the fact
E04 0270  5    that four of the ten versions I listened to are by
E04 0280  3    Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian
E04 0280 10    Aeschbacher, and Victor Babin) also sheds light on
E04 0290  8    the master's pedagogical skills. Certain pianistic
E04 0300  4    traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions,
E04 0310  2    most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs from
E04 0320  2    the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck
E04 0320 12    simultaneously). But the most impressive testimony
E04 0330  6    to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected
E04 0340  6    by the individuality which marks each student's approach
E04 0350  3    as distinctly his own.
E04 0350  7       Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity, his innate
E04 0360  6    rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous intensity all tend
E04 0370  4    to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no detail
E04 0380  2    was too small to receive attention from this master,
E04 0380 11    and as a result the playing here has humor, delicacy,
E04 0390  8    and radiant humanity. This is a serious-minded interpretation,
E04 0400  6    but it is never strait-laced. And although Schnabel's
E04 0410  3    pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously
E04 0420  1    faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase
E04 0420  8    indications. The piano performance on this Trout is
E04 0430  8    one that really demands a search for superlatives.
E04 0440  5       About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy.
E04 0450  5    I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate
E04 0460  2    with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic playing
E04 0470  2    was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative
E04 0470 11    outlook than the style of the Belgian group. From a
E04 0480 10    technical standpoint, the string playing is good, but
E04 0490  7    the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of
E04 0500  5    things here. The violinist, in particular, is very
E04 0510  1    indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched
E04 0510 11    and edgy. The twenty-five-year-old recording offers
E04 0520  8    rather faded string tone, but the balance between the
E04 0530  6    instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet.
E04 0540  2    There is a break in continuity just before the fourth
E04 0540 12    variation in the "Forellen" movement, and I suspect
E04 0550  8    that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides
E04 0560  7    of the original SPs.
E04 0570  1       Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London)
E04 0570  9    offers the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every
E04 0580  7    detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought
E04 0590  5    out, and of these I would especially cite the delicious
E04 0600  4    la^ndler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation
E04 0610  2    (an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese
E04 0620  1    musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout. Some
E04 0620  8    of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky, however.
E04 0630  7    Why, for example, does he favor two tempos, rather
E04 0640  4    than one, for the third movement? The assisting musicians
E04 0650  2    from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise,
E04 0660  1    but their contribution is rustic and appealing. (Special
E04 0660  9    compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp:
E04 0670  9    his scrawny, tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity
E04 0680  7    to the performance.)
E04 0690  1       The Glazer-Fine Arts edition (Concert-Disc) is a
E04 0690 10    model of lucidity and organization. It is, moreover,
E04 0700  6    a perfectly integrated ensemble effort. But having
E04 0710  4    lived with the disc for some time now, I find the performance
E04 0720  3    less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's
E04 0730  1    (whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet
E04 0730  8    has still to be recorded) and a good deal less filled
E04 0740  9    with humor than Curzon's. Aeschbacher's work is very
E04 0750  5    much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound on his Decca
E04 0760  4    disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating
E04 0770  1    a copy of it.
E04 0770  5       The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet (Angel) and
E04 0780  2    Victor Babin-Festival Quartet (RCA Victor) editions
E04 0790  1    give us superlative string playing (both in symphonic
E04 0790  9    style) crippled by unimaginative piano playing. (Babin
E04 0800  6    has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner, but
E04 0810  4    his playing is of limited insight.) Badura-Skoda-Vienna
E04 0820  1    Konzerthaus (Westminster) and Demus-Schubert Quartet
E04 0830  1    (Deutsche Grammophon) are both warm-toned, pleasantly
E04 0830  8    lyrical, but rather slack and tensionless. Helmut Roloff,
E04 0840  8    playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth
E04 0850  6    Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in much the same
E04 0860  4    vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists. Telefunken
E04 0870  1    has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced
E04 0870 10    disc (it sells for $2.98) is worthy of consideration.
E04 0880  8       Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue, I
E04 0890  6    am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's
E04 0900  4    musical penetration. Here is truly a "Great Recording
E04 0910  1    of the Century", and its greatness is by no means diminished
E04 0920  1    by the fact that it is not quite perfect. This recording
E04 0920 12    surely belongs in everyone's collection. MUST records
E04 0940  3    always sound like records?
E04 0940  7       From the beginning of commercial recording, new
E04 0950  5    discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real
E04 0960  4    Thing have regularly been put in circulation. Seen
E04 0970  1    in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine
E04 0970 10    claim to be milestones. Although lacking absolute verisimilitude,
E04 0980  5    they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary
E04 0990  8    materials for re-creation of the original. On the basis
E04 1000  7    of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso
E04 1010  3    sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal
E04 1020  1    under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble
E04 1020 11    Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.
E04 1030 10       Since the concept of high fidelity became important
E04 1040  8    some dozen years ago, the claims of technical improvements
E04 1050  6    have multiplied tenfold. In many cases the revolutionary
E04 1060  4    production has offered no more than sensational effects:
E04 1070  2    the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning
E04 1080  1    as the gap between sound and substance became clearer.
E04 1080 10    Other innovations with better claims to musical interest
E04 1090  8    survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of
E04 1100  8    classics. If we return to them today, we have no difficulty
E04 1110  5    spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing.
E04 1120  3       Records sound like records because they provide
E04 1130  1    a different sort of experience than live music. This
E04 1130 10    difference is made up of many factors. Some of them
E04 1140  9    are obvious, such as the fact that we associate recorded
E04 1150  5    and live music with our reponses and behavior in different
E04 1160  3    types of environments and social settings. (Music often
E04 1170  1    sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit
E04 1170 12    in something more comfortable than a theatre seat.)
E04 1180  7    From the technical standpoint, records differ from
E04 1190  4    live music to the degree that they fail to convey the
E04 1200  2    true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity,
E04 1200  8    pulse, and pitch of the original. Any alteration of
E04 1210  7    one of these factors is distortion, although we generally
E04 1220  4    use that word only for effects so pronounced that they
E04 1230  3    can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard
E04 1230 12    tests. Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the
E04 1240  9    fitting together of fractional bits until the total
E04 1250  6    reaches the threshold of our awareness, that makes
E04 1260  3    records sound like records. The sound may be good;
E04 1270  1    but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what
E04 1270 12    you are hearing is only a clever imitation.
E04 1280  6       Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to
E04 1290  5    make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather
E04 1300  1    than a copy of one. Like the recent Scheherazade from
E04 1300 11    London (HIGH FIDELITY, Sept. 1961), it is successful
E04 1310  8    because emphasis has been placed on good musical and
E04 1320  8    engineering practices rather than on creating sensational
E04 1330  4    effects. Because of this, only those with truly fine
E04 1340  3    equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree
E04 1340 12    of the engineers' triumph.
E04 1350  3       The easiest way to describe this release is to say
E04 1360  4    that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg
E04 1370  1    performance with minimal alteration of its musical
E04 1370  8    values. The engineering as such never obtrudes upon
E04 1380  6    your consciousness. The effect of the recording is
E04 1390  4    very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis
E04 1400  1    exactly what you would expect from a live performance.
E04 1400 10    This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not
E04 1410  8    only produces greater fidelity, but it eliminates listener
E04 1420  4    fatigue. A contributing factor is the perspective,
E04 1430  1    the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.
E04 1430  8    The orchestra is far enough away from you that you
E04 1440  9    miss the bow scrapes, valve clicks, and other noises
E04 1450  5    incidental to playing. Yet you feel the orchestra is
E04 1460  2    near at hand, and the individual instruments have the
E04 1460 11    same firm presence associated with listening from a
E04 1470  7    good seat in an acoustically perfect hall. Command
E04 1480  4    has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation. The
E04 1490  2    music is always allowed the living space needed to
E04 1490 11    attain its full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes
E04 1500  8    as a quasi-performer. The timbre remains that of the
E04 1510  6    instruments unclouded by resonance.
E04 1520  1       All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance
E04 1520 12    lacked authority and musical distinction. For me it
E04 1530  8    has more of both elements than the majority of its
E04 1540  6    competitors. Steinberg seems to have gone directly
E04 1550  2    back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built
E04 1550 11    his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully
E04 1560  9    as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper.
E04 1570  7       Those accustomed to broader, more romantic statements
E04 1580  4    of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when
E04 1590  3    they hear this one. Without losing the distinctive
E04 1590 11    undertow of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and
E04 1600  9    the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality
E04 1610  6    that makes for maximum cumulative effect. The Presto
E04 1620  3    ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken
E04 1630  2    literally and may shock you, as the real Allegro con
E04 1630 12    spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your
E04 1640 11    feet. In the end, however, the thing about this performance
E04 1650  6    that is most striking is the way it sings. Steinberg
E04 1660  4    obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element
E04 1670  1    which must dominate in this score, and he manages at
E04 1670 11    times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting
E04 1680  8    into song.
E04 1680 10       The engineering provides exactly the support needed
E04 1690  7    for such a result. Too many records seem to reduce
E04 1700  6    a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its
E04 1710  3    accompaniment. The Command technique invites you to
E04 1710 10    listen to the depth of the orchestration. Your ear
E04 1720  9    takes you into the ensemble, and you may well become
E04 1730  6    aware of instrumental details which previously were
E04 1740  2    apparent only in the score. It is this sort of experience
E04 1750  1    that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical
E04 1750 11    significance for the home music listener. The first
E04 1770  3    substantially complete stereo Giselle (and the only
E04 1770 10    one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided LP edition
E04 1780 10    of 1958 for Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely
E04 1790  8    to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment.
E04 1800  3    The already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve music
E04 1810  2    itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic
E04 1810  8    contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly,
E04 1820  7    if suave, sentimentality. And in its engineers' frantic
E04 1830  6    attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting
E04 1840  4    brilliance, the recording sounds as though it had been
E04 1850  4    "doctored for super-high fidelity". The home listener
E04 1860  1    is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a
E04 1860 10    far from pleasant one. As with the penultimate Giselle
E04 1870  7    release (Wolff's abridgment for RCA Victor) I find
E04 1880  6    the cleaner, less razor-edged monophonic version, for
E04 1890  3    all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more aurally
E04 1900  2    tolerable- but this may be the result of processing
E04 1900 11    defects in my SD copies.
