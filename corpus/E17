E17 0010  1    You can build this vacation cottage yourself. It is
E17 0010 10    a full scale, small, but efficient house that can become
E17 0020  7    a year 'round retreat complete in every detail. Because
E17 0030  5    of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski,
E17 0040  2    you can build most of it in your own home workshop
E17 0050  1    in your spare time. Most of it is panelized and utilizes
E17 0050 12    standard materials, and requires the use of only simple
E17 0060  8    tools. On the following pages and in the following
E17 0070  6    issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation
E17 0080  3    cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying
E17 0080 11    the final trim.
E17 0095  1       In recognition of the growing trend for second homes,
E17 0100  1    or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically
E17 0100 10    with the family handyman in mind. It is a big project,
E17 0110 11    not to be taken lightly. But each step has been broken
E17 0120  7    down into easy stages, utilizing standard materials
E17 0130  3    and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the
E17 0140  1    handyman.
E17 0140  2    #THE THEORY#
E17 0140  4    The idea behind our design is modular units, or panelization.
E17 0150  3    Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes
E17 0160  2    and measurements of materials. Wall panels and structural
E17 0160 10    timbers are standard as are windows and doors, making
E17 0170  9    for a minimum of cutting. We have developed an ingenious
E17 0180  6    method of interlocking these so that you can make the
E17 0190  6    major part of your house in your own workshop, panel
E17 0200  2    by panel, according to plan. Thus, when you have prepared
E17 0200 12    your foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked
E17 0210 10    to the site and erected with a small crew of friends
E17 0220  7    in a weekend. The roof timbers are precut and the panels
E17 0230  5    standard so that the house can be completely enclosed
E17 0240  1    in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do
E17 0240 13    the finishing touches at your leisure.
E17 0250  5    #A WARNING#
E17 0250  7    Due to the fact that building codes and regulations
E17 0260  4    vary so much throughout the country, the first thing
E17 0270  2    to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close
E17 0270 14    to a large city they might even specify the size of
E17 0280  9    the nails used; in a remote section there might be
E17 0290  5    no restrictions at all. This can usually be found out
E17 0300  4    at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the
E17 0300 15    electrical, plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as
E17 0310  6    well as possible zoning regulations. Whether electricity
E17 0320  4    and public water and sewers are available or not, check
E17 0330  4    the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas
E17 0340  2    (we give you alternatives later on). Be sure that this
E17 0340 12    information is reasonably official and not just an
E17 0350  8    unfounded opinion. If there are any major restrictions,
E17 0360  5    they usually can be obtained in printed form. Where
E17 0370  3    a building permit is required, find out what you must
E17 0380  1    present when applying for one. In many cases, you must
E17 0380 11    file a complete set of plans with the local building
E17 0390  8    inspector. These will be available at cost from our
E17 0400  5    Plans Department.
E17 0400  7    #THE SITE#
E17 0400  9    Some general things to look for in a site, if you haven't
E17 0410 11    already bought one, are accessibility, water drainage,
E17 0420  4    and orientation. How are the roads, and how will they
E17 0430  5    stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;
E17 0440  1    swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the
E17 0440 10    early spring after a thaw will be very informative.
E17 0450  9    Note where the sun rises and sets, and ask which direction
E17 0460  7    the prevailing winds and storms come from. Will the
E17 0470  5    view be something you can live with? Don't worry too
E17 0480  3    much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up
E17 0480 13    alternative foundations later on.
E17 0490  4    #THE MATERIALS#
E17 0490  6    With this first issue we give you a list of the materials
E17 0500  9    needed to build the basic (A version) and the expandable
E17 0510  5    (B version). This will be for the shell of the house
E17 0520  5    only (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include
E17 0530  1    the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get
E17 0530 11    a rough estimate of how much the materials for the
E17 0540  9    shell will cost. Bear in mind that this does not include
E17 0550  6    interior panels for partitions, fancy flooring, appliances
E17 0560  3    and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing, all
E17 0570  2    of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.
E17 0570 13       The wall panels are constructed of a framework of
E17 0580  9    standard **f and **f of a good grade, free from structural
E17 0590  7    faults. They should be as straight as possible, as
E17 0600  4    this will effect their ability to mesh properly when
E17 0610  1    the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid
E17 0610 11    units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board
E17 0620  9    such as plywood, plastic coated panel board, high density
E17 0630  5    particle board, asbestos-cement board, or any other
E17 0640  3    product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your
E17 0640 10    building supply dealer. The inner panels do not have
E17 0650  9    to be weatherproof, and the choice will depend on the
E17 0660  7    quality of finish desired. All panel board comes in
E17 0670  4    standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels
E17 0680  1    be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed
E17 0680 13    window panels with louvers should have a good grade
E17 0690  8    of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing
E17 0700  6    compound. The louvers are constructed as shown in the
E17 0710  4    detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are
E17 0710 13    standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum
E17 0720  8    frames for those panels requiring them. The door panels
E17 0730  6    are designed to accommodate standard doors which should
E17 0740  4    be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable
E17 0750  1    ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving
E17 0750 11    no wastage. The battens covering the joints are of
E17 0760  7    **f stock and are applied after the walls are erected.
E17 0770  5    All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is highly
E17 0780  2    recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used
E17 0780 11    inside and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the
E17 0790 12    other, and 1/8-inch glass is used, stock lumber in
E17 0800  6    **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the glass panels.
E17 0810  3    Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special
E17 0820  1    size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there
E17 0820 11    is no special milling or rabbeting required for the
E17 0830  6    panels.
E17 0840  1       With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude
E17 0840  9    of cutting tools, fixtures, and attachments available,
E17 0850  6    the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool.
E17 0860  6    The drill press consists of a vertical shaft (spindle)
E17 0870  3    which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill
E17 0880  2    chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle
E17 0880 11    is mounted, a head in which the quill is mounted, a
E17 0890 10    feed lever which moves the quill up or down, a power
E17 0900  7    source, and a movable table upon which the work is
E17 0910  2    placed. There is often a means of locking the quill
E17 0910 12    and, on larger presses, the table can be tilted.
E17 0920  7       The size of the press is usually expressed in terms
E17 0930  5    of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool shank
E17 0940  2    it will hold) or distance between the spindle center
E17 0940 11    and the column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets
E17 0950 10    you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle.
E17 0960  8       A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity
E17 0970  5    has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done
E17 0980  1    at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm
E17 0980 12    that swivels on the supporting column to position the
E17 0990  7    drill bit instead of the work.
E17 1000  1    #SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE#
E17 1000  5    The drill press should be leveled and, depending on
E17 1010  2    whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely
E17 1010 12    to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor
E17 1020 10    with lag or expansion screws. This will reduce vibration
E17 1030  5    and increase accuracy.
E17 1030  8       A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of
E17 1040 11    wax paper will protect the polished surface of the
E17 1050  5    table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage
E17 1060  3    rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted
E17 1070  1    with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil
E17 1070 11    now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill.
E17 1080  7    The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting
E17 1090  4    with a clean rag or brush.
E17 1090 10       Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and
E17 1100  9    grease. Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of
E17 1110  4    two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep the
E17 1120  2    belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when
E17 1120 12    pulled by hand; excess tension will only cause undue
E17 1130  8    wear on the motor and spindle bearings. Most drill
E17 1140  4    presses have a quill return spring that raises the
E17 1150  2    spindle automatically when the feed lever is released
E17 1150 10    and holds the quill in the raised position. The return
E17 1160  9    spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements
E17 1170  6    by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers
E17 1180  6    (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released),
E17 1190  3    loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing
E17 1200  1    until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the
E17 1200  9    housing clockwise will reduce tension, counter-clockwise
E17 1210  6    will increase it.
E17 1210  9    #DON'T LOSE THE CHUCK KEY#
E17 1220  5    Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide
E17 1230  1    a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have
E17 1230 10    to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable
E17 1240  9    spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the
E17 1250  6    key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom
E17 1260  2    of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way
E17 1260 15    when not in use.
E17 1270  3    #FEEDS AND SPEEDS#
E17 1270  6    Drill speeds are important if you want a good job.
E17 1280  4    Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed,
E17 1290  1    depending on the material worked. On most drill presses,
E17 1290 10    it is impossible to get the exact speed, but you can
E17 1300  9    come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone
E17 1310  7    pulleys. You will find a chart giving the various speed
E17 1320  3    ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere
E17 1330  1    in the instruction booklet that came with the tool.
E17 1330 10    See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.
E17 1340  8    Generally, the larger the tool and the harder the material,
E17 1350  7    the slower the speed.
E17 1350 11       Feed pressure is also of major importance. Too much
E17 1360  8    pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity
E17 1370  6    and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools.
E17 1380  4    Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other
E17 1380 13    hard material, causes overheating of the tool and burning
E17 1390  9    of the cutting edge. The best results will be obtained
E17 1400  8    by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure
E17 1410  6    that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate.
E17 1420  2    #COMMON DRILLING TOOLS#
E17 1420  5    There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill
E17 1430  5    holes. The most common are the twist drill, the solid
E17 1440  2    center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the
E17 1440  9    double spur bit, and the power wood bit. All will do
E17 1450 10    a good job if sharp, but the twist drills don't cut
E17 1460  5    quite as smoothly as the others, since they do not
E17 1470  3    have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before
E17 1470 12    actual boring starts.
E17 1480  3       The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting
E17 1490  1    large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size
E17 1490 12    discs by reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters
E17 1500  8    are one sided and not balanced, they should be used
E17 1510  6    at the slowest speed available, and fed very slowly
E17 1520  3    to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting
E17 1530  1    your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to
E17 1530 13    avoid nicked fingers, keep your hands well out of the
E17 1540  8    way.
E17 1540  9    #SIMPLE HOLE DRILLING OPERATIONS#
E17 1550  1    When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always
E17 1550 10    place a piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not
E17 1560  9    only protect the work table, but also assure a clean
E17 1570  7    breakthrough. Another method of assuring a clean hole
E17 1580  4    is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through,
E17 1590  1    then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn
E17 1590 10    the piece over, and finish from the other side. In
E17 1600  8    soft woods with pronounced grain, there is sometimes
E17 1610  4    a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying
E17 1620  1    hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small
E17 1620 11    pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve
E17 1630  9    accuracy.
E17 1630 10       When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth,
E17 1640  9    mark the depth on the side of the stock, then run the
E17 1650  7    bit down so that it is even with the mark. The depth
E17 1660  3    gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored
E17 1660 15    to exact and identical depth.
