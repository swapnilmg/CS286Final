F20 0010  1    As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the
F20 0010 11    spirit of peace and good will, and in exchange for
F20 0020  8    armed support in the April election campaign, bestowed
F20 0030  3    upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke
F20 0040  2    Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The
F20 0040 13    coalition was to prove inadvisable.
F20 0050  5       O'Banion was a complex and frightening man, whose
F20 0060  3    bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour
F20 0070  1    into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased
F20 0070 11    in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even
F20 0080  9    when he was pumping bullets into someone's body. He
F20 0090  5    carried three guns- one in the right trouser pocket,
F20 0100  3    one under his left armpit, one in the left outside
F20 0100 13    coat pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands.
F20 0110  8    He killed accurately, freely, and dispassionately.
F20 0120  4    The police credited him with twenty-five murders but
F20 0130  3    he was never brought to trial for one of them. Like
F20 0140  2    a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He
F20 0140 11    was an expert florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement
F20 0150  7    of bouquets and wreaths. He had no apparent comprehension
F20 0160  6    of morality; he divided humanity into "right guys"
F20 0170  4    and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he was always
F20 0180  3    willing to kill and trample under. He had what was
F20 0180 13    described by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality".
F20 0190  8    He walked with a heavy list to the right, as that leg
F20 0200  8    was four inches shorter than the other, but the lurch
F20 0210  4    did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.
F20 0210 13    Landesco thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly"
F20 0220  9    but he was, in fact, with his aggression and hostility,
F20 0230  8    and nerveless indifference to risking or administering
F20 0240  5    pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also at this time,
F20 0250  4    although not so interwoven in high politics and the
F20 0250 13    rackets as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and
F20 0260  9    most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld,
F20 0270  6    the roughneck king.
F20 0270  9       O'Banion was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant
F20 0280 10    Irish plasterer, in the North Side's Little Hell, close
F20 0290  8    by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner. He had been
F20 0300  7    a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served
F20 0310  4    as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence of Mass
F20 0320  3    was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum
F20 0320 12    tenements among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust
F20 0330  8    saloons of his birthplace; he ran wild with the child
F20 0340  7    gangs of the neighbourhood, and went through the normal
F20 0350  5    pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging,
F20 0360  1    and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working
F20 0360 12    as a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a
F20 0370 12    streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened
F20 0380  5    leg. Because of this he was known as Gimpy (but, as
F20 0390  4    with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in
F20 0400  1    his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in
F20 0400 10    the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing
F20 0410  9    waiter in McGovern's Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy
F20 0420  7    dive in North Clark Street, where befuddled customers
F20 0430  3    were methodically looted of their money by the singing
F20 0440  1    waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job
F20 0440 11    with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger,
F20 0450  7    a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news
F20 0460  8    pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors.
F20 0470  4    He was also at the same time gaining practical experience
F20 0480  2    as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how
F20 0480 11    to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer
F20 0490  8    named Gene Geary, later committed to Chester Asylum
F20 0500  5    as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes misted with tears
F20 0510  4    when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother
F20 0520  2    in his clear and syrupy tenor.
F20 0520  8       O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in
F20 0530  6    1909, at seventeen, when he was committed to Bridewell
F20 0540  3    Prison for three months for burglary; two years later
F20 0550  2    he served another three months for assault. Those were
F20 0550 11    his only interludes behind bars, although he collected
F20 0560  7    four more charges on his police record in 1921 and
F20 0570  6    1922, three for burglary and one for robbery. But by
F20 0580  3    now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.
F20 0590  1    On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000
F20 0590 10    bond was furnished by an alderman, and the charge was
F20 0600  9    nolle prossed. On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually
F20 0610  8    come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down
F20 0620  5    on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office
F20 0630  2    safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted
F20 0640  1    better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at
F20 0640 10    a cost of $30,000 in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly
F20 0650  8    as Torrio, O'Banion jumped into bootlegging. He conducted
F20 0660  5    it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence
F20 0670  2    than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side
F20 0680  1    portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.
F20 0680 12    Unlike the Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups,
F20 0690  6    robberies, and safe-cracking expeditions, and refused
F20 0700  4    to touch prostitution. He was also personally active
F20 0710  2    in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired
F20 0720  1    sufficient political might to be able to state: "I
F20 0720 10    always deliver my borough as per requirements".
F20 0730  6       But whose requirements? Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers
F20 0740  5    and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side
F20 0750  5    domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer
F20 0760  1    gag that went around at that time: Q. "Who'll carry
F20 0770  2    the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A. "O'Banion,
F20 0780  1    in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close
F20 0780 11    the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine
F20 0790  6    reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition,
F20 0810  7    and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans.
F20 0820  4    To forestall any change of allegiance, the Democrats
F20 0830  3    hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion,
F20 0840  1    as public reward for his past services and as a reminder
F20 0840 12    of where his loyalties lay.
F20 0850  4       The reception was held in a private dining room
F20 0860  2    of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an
F20 0860 13    interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers,
F20 0870  7    ward heelers, sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest
F20 0880  8    list is in itself a little parable of the state of
F20 0890  6    American civic life at this time. It included the top
F20 0900  3    O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.
F20 0910  1       When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned
F20 0910 10    Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring
F20 0920 10    the police department by consorting with these felons
F20 0930  6    and fixers. Hughes said that he had understood the
F20 0940  3    party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the proprieter
F20 0950  2    of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised
F20 0960  1    a number of notorious characters I had thrown into
F20 0960 10    the detective bureau basement half a dozen times, I
F20 0970  8    knew I had been framed, and withdrew almost at once".
F20 0980  5       In fact, O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony
F20 0990  4    with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.
F20 1000  1    There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's
F20 1000 10    men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot
F20 1010 10    a waiter who was pestering him for a tip. Then O'Banion
F20 1020  7    was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies
F20 1030  5    and diamonds.
F20 1030  7       This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the
F20 1040  7    relationship between the gangs and the politicians,
F20 1050  1    which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained
F20 1050 10    with more or less stealth", but which henceforth was
F20 1060  9    marked by these ostentatious gatherings, denounced
F20 1070  3    by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts", at which "politicians
F20 1080  4    fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, openly, in
F20 1090  3    the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They became
F20 1100  2    an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the
F20 1100 11    way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal
F20 1110  8    and county governments in 1928-29".
F20 1120  4       However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors no
F20 1130  2    good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch
F20 1130  9    and the tributes to his loyalty, and proceeded with
F20 1140  7    the bigger and better Republican deal. On Election
F20 1150  4    Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled his force
F20 1160  3    of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat
F20 1170  1    votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican
F20 1170 10    candidates.
F20 1180  1       This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning
F20 1180  7    power did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past
F20 1190 10    year there had been too many examples of his euphoric
F20 1200  7    self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking.
F20 1210  4    He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence
F20 1220  1    that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved
F20 1220  9    towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence
F20 1230  7    that enraged them beneath their blandness. They were
F20 1240  5    disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as, when his bodyguard,
F20 1250  4    Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed
F20 1260  1    by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of
F20 1260 10    a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation,
F20 1270 10    who were Hirschey, a gambler-politician in loose beer-running
F20 1280  8    league with Torrio and O'Banion, Frank, a policeman,
F20 1290  4    and Max, the youngest. To settle this slight, O'Banion
F20 1300  3    went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, where,
F20 1310  2    he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening
F20 1310 11    of a musical comedy. At the end of the performance,
F20 1320 10    Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer
F20 1330  7    among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters.
F20 1340  3    O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely
F20 1350  1    wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted
F20 1350 10    off Max's belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some
F20 1370  9    distress. O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out
F20 1380  8    of the theatre; he was neither prosecuted nor even
F20 1390  4    arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort of
F20 1400  2    reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.
F20 1410  1       A further example of the incompatible difference
F20 1410  7    in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio
F20 1420  8    beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300
F20 1430  4    to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned
F20 1440  1    O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau-
F20 1440  9    and reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was:
F20 1450  7    "Three hundred dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get
F20 1460  9    them knocked off for half that much". Upon which the
F20 1470  7    detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent
F20 1480  4    trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal
F20 1490  3    with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the
F20 1490 12    beer-runner, unhappy with this solution, telephoned
F20 1500  6    Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message: "Say,
F20 1510  6    Dionie, I just been talking to Johnny, and he said
F20 1520  6    to let them cops have the three hundred. He says he
F20 1530  3    don't want no trouble".
F20 1530  7       But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and
F20 1540  6    distrust the Irishman. For three years, since the liquor
F20 1550  4    territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic
F20 1560  1    patience, and because he knew that retaliation could
F20 1560  9    cause only violent warfare and disaster to business,
F20 1570  6    tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing. They
F20 1580  4    had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of his sharp
F20 1590  3    practice in Cicero.
F20 1590  6       When, as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment
F20 1600  6    for the loan of gunmen in the April election, Torrio
F20 1610  2    had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from
F20 1620  1    that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months
F20 1620 11    O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month-
F20 1630  8    mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago
F20 1640  6    speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb.
F20 1650  2    These booze customers had until then been buying their
F20 1650 11    supplies from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake
F20 1660  9    gangs, and now they were competing for trade with the
F20 1670 10    Torrio-Capone saloons; once again O'Banion's brash
F20 1680  5    recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will.
F20 1690  4    The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up
F20 1700  3    still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone
F20 1710  1    takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's
F20 1710 10    South and West Sides. But he still showed no intention
F20 1720  9    of sharing with the syndicate. At last, even the controlled
F20 1730  7    Torrio was unable to hold still, and he tentatively
F20 1740  4    suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in
F20 1750  2    the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero
F20 1750 12    beer concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh
F20 1760  8    and a flat refusal.
F20 1770  1       Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by
F20 1770  8    the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling
F20 1780  8    yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth
F20 1790  6    $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition
F20 1800  5    era- the Sibley warehouse robbery, which became famous
F20 1810  4    for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was
F20 1820  1    stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750
F20 1820  9    cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the
F20 1830  9    O'Banion men, who left in their stead the same number
F20 1840  6    of barrels filled with water.
