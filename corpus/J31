J31 0010  1       It is not easy for the therapist to discern when,
J31 0010 11    in the patient's communicating, an introject has appeared
J31 0020  6    and is holding sway. One learns to become alert to
J31 0030  6    changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's suddenly
J31 0040  2    shifting to a quality not like his usual one, a quality
J31 0050  1    which sounds somehow artificial or, in some instances,
J31 0050  9    parrotlike. The content of his words may lapse back
J31 0060  8    into monotonous repetition, as if a phonograph needle
J31 0070  5    were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so simple
J31 0080  2    as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn
J31 0080 13    axiom, common to our culture, which he has evidently
J31 0090  9    heard, over and over, from a parent until he experiences
J31 0100  7    it as part of him.
J31 0100 12       One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in
J31 0110  6    what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of
J31 0120  4    pseudo-emotion, during which, despite her wracking
J31 0130  1    sobs and streaming cheeks, I felt only a cold annoyance
J31 0130 11    with her. Eventually such incidents became more sporadic,
J31 0140  7    and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day
J31 0150  6    behavior, and in one particular session, after several
J31 0160  3    minutes of such behavior- which, as usual, went on
J31 0170  1    without any accompanying words from her- she asked,
J31 0170  9    eagerly, "Did you see Granny"? At first I did not know
J31 0180 10    what she meant; I thought she must be seeing me as
J31 0190  8    some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother,
J31 0210  3    in their distant home-city. Then I realized that she
J31 0220  2    had been deliberately showing me, this time, what Granny
J31 0220 11    was like; and when I replied in this spirit, she corroborated
J31 0230 10    my hunch.
J31 0240  1       At another phase in the therapy, when a pathogenic
J31 0240 10    mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon
J31 0250  8    the investigative scene, she muttered in a low but
J31 0260  5    intense voice, to herself, "I hate that woman inside
J31 0270  1    me"! I could evoke no further elaboration from her
J31 0270 10    about this; but a few seconds later she was standing
J31 0280  9    directly across the room from me, looking me in the
J31 0290  7    eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone,
J31 0300  2    "Your father despises you"! Again, I at first misconstrued
J31 0320  1    this disconcertingly intense communication, and I quickly
J31 0320  8    cast through my mind to account for her being able
J31 0330 10    to speak, with such utter conviction, of an opinion
J31 0340  5    held by my father, now several years deceased. Then
J31 0350  2    I replied, coldly, "If you despise me, why don't you
J31 0360  1    say so, directly"? She looked confused at this, and
J31 0360 10    I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to
J31 0370 10    make. It then occurred to me to ask, "Is that what
J31 0380  5    that woman told you"? She clearly agreed that this
J31 0390  3    had been the case. I realized, now, that she had been
J31 0390 14    showing me, in what impressed me as being a very accurate
J31 0400 11    way, something her mother had once said to her; it
J31 0410  8    was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why
J31 0420  4    she hated that woman inside her. What had been an unmanageably
J31 0430  1    powerful introject was now, despite its continuing
J31 0430  8    charge of energy disconcerting to me, sufficiently
J31 0440  7    within control of her ego that she could use it to
J31 0450  7    show me what this introjected mother was like.
J31 0460  1       Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic
J31 0460 11    variety of introjects that at times, when she was in
J31 0470 10    her room alone, it would sound to a passerby as though
J31 0480  7    there were several different persons in the room, as
J31 0490  4    she would vocalize in various kinds of voice. A somewhat
J31 0500  1    less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine, who used
J31 0500  9    to often seclude herself in her room, often sounded
J31 0510  7    through the closed door- as I would find on passing
J31 0520  5    by, between our sessions- for all the world like two
J31 0530  3    persons, a scolding mother and a defensive child.
J31 0530 11       Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are
J31 0540  8    those instances in which the patient is manifesting
J31 0550  5    an introject traceable to something in the therapist,
J31 0560  2    some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is
J31 0560 12    himself only poorly aware, and the recognition of which,
J31 0570  9    as a part of himself, he finds distinctly unwelcome.
J31 0580  5    I have found, time and again, that some bit of particularly
J31 0590  5    annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a
J31 0600  3    patient rests, in the final analysis, on this basis;
J31 0600 12    and only when I can acknowledge this, to myself, as
J31 0610  9    being indeed an aspect of my personality, does it cease
J31 0620  6    to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's
J31 0630  3    behavior. For example, one hebephrenic man used to
J31 0640  1    annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I
J31 0640 10    got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment
J31 0650  6    that I would be seeing him on the following day, or
J31 0660  4    whenever, "You're welcome", in a notably condescending
J31 0670  1    fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank
J31 0670 11    him for the privilege of spending the hour with him,
J31 0680 10    and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a
J31 0690  7    humbly grateful, "thank you" to him at the end of each
J31 0700  6    session. Eventually it became clear to me, partly with
J31 0710  2    the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could
J31 0710 10    point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly,
J31 0720  7    that this man, with his condescending, "You're welcome",
J31 0730  3    was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious
J31 0740  5    condescension which had been present in my own demeanor,
J31 0750  2    over these months, on each of these occasions when
J31 0750 11    I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note, each
J31 0760 10    time, that the healing Christ would be stooping to
J31 0770  6    dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on
J31 0780  3    the morrow.
J31 0780  5       Another patient, a paranoid woman, for many months
J31 0790  2    infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her
J31 0790 12    fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she
J31 0800  8    owned the whole building, as though she were the only
J31 0810  7    person in it whose needs were to be met. This behavior
J31 0820  3    on her part subsided only after I had come to see the
J31 0830  1    uncomfortably close similarity between, on the one
J31 0830  8    hand, her arranging the ventilation of the common living
J31 0840  7    room to her own liking, or turning the television off
J31 0850  4    or on without regard to the wishes of the others, and
J31 0860  2    on the other hand, my own coming stolidly into her
J31 0860 12    room despite her persistent and vociferous objections,
J31 0870  6    bringing my big easy chair with me, usually shutting
J31 0880  5    the windows of her room which she preferred to keep
J31 0890  3    in a very cold state, and plunking myself down in my
J31 0890 14    chair- in short, behaving as if I owned her room.
J31 0900 12    #4. CONDENSATION:#
J31 0900 14    Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated,
J31 0910  9    or reduced, in their communicative expression, to some
J31 0920  7    comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement.
J31 0930  5       One finds, for example, that a terse and stereotyped
J31 0940  1    verbal expression, seeming at first to be a mere hollow
J31 0950  4    convention, reveals itself over the months of therapy
J31 0960  1    as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense
J31 0960 11    feelings, and the most unconventional of meanings.
J31 0970  6    More than anything, it is the therapist's intuitive
J31 0980  3    sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype
J31 0990  1    which helps these meanings to become revealed, something
J31 0990  9    like a spread-out deck of cards, on sporadic occasions
J31 1000  7    over the passage of the patient's and his months of
J31 1010  6    work together. one cannot assume, of course, that all
J31 1020  3    these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype
J31 1030  1    at the beginning of the therapy, or at any one time
J31 1030 12    later on when the stereotype was uttered; probably
J31 1040  6    it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well-grooved,
J31 1050  7    stereotyped mode of expression- and no, or but a few,
J31 1060  5    other communicational grooves, as yet- being there,
J31 1070  1    available for the patient's use, as newly-emerging
J31 1070  9    emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of
J31 1080 10    months. But it is true that the therapist can sense,
J31 1090  4    when he hears this stereotype, that there are at this
J31 1100  3    moment many emotional determinants at work in it, a
J31 1100 12    blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to
J31 1110  8    become clearly delineated from one another.
J31 1120  3       Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a "How
J31 1130  2    are you now"? or an "I want to go home", or whatever-
J31 1140  3    but a nonverbal one which reveals itself, gradually,
J31 1140 11    as the condensed expression of more than one latent
J31 1150  7    meaning. A hebephrenic man used to give a repetitious
J31 1160  5    wave of his hand a number of times during his largely-silent
J31 1170  1    hours with his therapist. When the therapist came to
J31 1170 10    feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him,
J31 1180 10    "What is that, Bill- hello or farewell"?, the patient
J31 1190  6    replied, "Both, Dearie- two in one".
J31 1200  6       Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression,
J31 1210  1    that which seems best to give release, and communicational
J31 1210 10    expression, to complex and undifferentiated feelings
J31 1220  6    is laughter. It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic
J31 1230  6    patient, the most severely dedifferentiated of all
J31 1240  3    schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic
J31 1250  1    symptoms, laughter- laughter which now makes one feel
J31 1250  9    scorned or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping,
J31 1260 10    or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty
J31 1270  9    expanse of man's despair; and which, more often than
J31 1280  5    all these, conveys a welter of feelings which could
J31 1290  2    in no way be conveyed by any number of words, words
J31 1300  8    which are so unlike this welter in being formed and
J31 1310  8    discrete from one another. To a much less full extent,
J31 1320  6    the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus has a comparable
J31 1330  4    communicative function; in working with these patients
J31 1340  1    the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private
J31 1340 11    mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch, or
J31 1350 10    the passage of flatus, not only because he is reduced
J31 1360  7    to this for lack of anything else to analyze, but also
J31 1370  3    because he learns that even these animal-like sounds
J31 1370 12    constitute forms of communication in which, from time
J31 1380  8    to time, quite different things are being said, long
J31 1390  6    before the patient can become sufficiently aware of
J31 1400  3    these, as distinct feelings and concepts, to say them
J31 1410  1    in words.
J31 1410  3       As I have been intimating, in the schizophrenic-
J31 1420  3    and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this
J31 1420 13    is a question which I have no wish to take up- condensation
J31 1430 10    is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed
J31 1440  6    expression of various feelings and ideas which are,
J31 1450  3    at an unconscious level, well sorted out, but rather
J31 1450 12    a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which,
J31 1460  7    even in the unconscious, have yet to become well differentiated
J31 1470  7    from one another. Freeman, Cameron and McGhie, in their
J31 1480  6    description of the disturbances of thinking found in
J31 1490  3    chronic schizophrenic patients, say, in regard to condensation,
J31 1500  1    that "... the lack of adequate discrimination between
J31 1500  9    the self and the environment, and the objects contained
J31 1510  9    therein ... in itself is the prototypical condensation".
J31 1520  5       In my experience, a great many of the patient's
J31 1530  6    more puzzling verbal communications are so for the
J31 1540  4    reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated
J31 1550  1    from figurative meanings in his subjective experience.
J31 1550  8    Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing, or
J31 1560  8    incident, in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding,
J31 1570  5    hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the
J31 1580  4    global scene. Recently, for example, a paranoid woman's
J31 1590  1    large-scale philosophizing, in the session, about the
J31 1590  9    intrusive curiosity which has become, in her opinion,
J31 1600  8    a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century
J31 1610  5    human culture, developed itself, before the end of
J31 1620  3    the session, into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously
J31 1620 12    peeking at her partially exposed breast, as indeed
J31 1630  8    I was. Or, equally often, a concretistic-seeming,
J31 1640  5    particularistic-seeming
J31 1640  7    statement may consist, with its mundane exterior, in
J31 1650  6    a form of poetry- may be full of meaning and emotion
J31 1660  5    when interpreted as a figurative expression: a metaphor,
J31 1670  3    a smile, an allegory, or some other symbolic mode of
J31 1670 13    speaking.
J31 1680  1       Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is,
J31 1680  9    more often than not, entirely unaware. His subjective
J31 1690  7    experience may be a remarkably concretistic one. One
J31 1700  4    hebephrenic women confided to me, "I live in a world
J31 1710  5    of words", as if, to her, words were fully concrete
J31 1720  1    objects; Burnham, in his excellent article (1955) concerning
J31 1720  9    schizophrenic communication, includes mention of similar
J31 1730  6    clinical material. A borderline schizophrenic young
J31 1740  5    man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts
J31 1750  3    about which he had been expounding, in a most articulate
J31 1760  1    fashion, during session after session with me, were
J31 1760  9    like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up
J31 1770  8    in the air above him; as he spoke I was reminded of
J31 1780  6    the great bales of cargo which are swung, high in the
J31 1790  3    air, from a docked steamship.
