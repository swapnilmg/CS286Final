E11 0010  1       LIVERY STABLE- J. VERNON, PROP". Coaching had declined
E11 0020  1    considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there,
E11 0020 10    near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco,
E11 0030  7    creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years. John
E11 0040  6    Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for- he had
E11 0050  3    prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching
E11 0060  1    was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the
E11 0060 12    pleasures of the table and driving. Twice a week he
E11 0070 10    drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road, upland
E11 0080  5    and through the redwood forest, with orchards below
E11 0090  2    him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the
E11 0090 13    other. The journey back he made along the coast road,
E11 0100  9    traveling hell-for-leather, every lantern of the tallyho
E11 0110  6    ablaze.
E11 0110  7       The southward route was the classic run in California,
E11 0120  7    and the most fashionable. His patronage on this stretch
E11 0130  4    was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars, most
E11 0140  2    of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not
E11 0140 11    complain at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in
E11 0150  9    the morning), nor of the tariff, which was reasonable
E11 0160  5    since it covered everything but the tobacco. Breakfast
E11 0170  2    was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in
E11 0170 11    the mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder
E11 0180  9    Creek or at Santa Cruz.
E11 0190  2       Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring,
E11 0190 11    so halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese
E11 0200  9    hostler, who rode with Vernon on the box, would break
E11 0210  8    open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or
E11 0220  5    sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree
E11 0230  1    to be heated over a spirit lamp.
E11 0230  8       In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group
E11 0240  8    of botanists which included an old friend of mine.
E11 0250  3    They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and
E11 0250 11    bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which
E11 0260  9    exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly
E11 0270  6    side of these mountains. In the Spanish days Franciscan
E11 0280  3    monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.
E11 0290  1    It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles
E11 0290 12    of Malabar. Vernon was serviceable on the botanical
E11 0300  7    field trips, but he could arrange no schedule with
E11 0310  5    the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped off,
E11 0320  2    and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.
E11 0330  1       My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning
E11 0330 10    of the regular tallyho run. This was an honor, like
E11 0340  8    dining with a captain at his private table. Vernon's
E11 0350  3    office adjoined the stable, and the walls were adorned
E11 0360  2    with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of
E11 0360 10    the period. They advertised harness polish, liniments,
E11 0370  6    Ball's Rubber Boots, Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla,
E11 0380  6    patent medicines, shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.
E11 0390  6       The hostler would have the table ready and a pot
E11 0400  6    of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter from
E11 0410  2    Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his
E11 0410 13    head. It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot
E11 0420 10    a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn
E11 0430  8    fritters. Vernon was consummately fond of oysters,
E11 0440  3    and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil
E11 0450  1    War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell,
E11 0450 10    cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when
E11 0460  9    served- was a standby at Manning's. Its early morning
E11 0470  4    patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves for
E11 0480  2    the day with that delicacy.
E11 0480  7       In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an
E11 0490  6    oyster dish named after its manager, John C. Kirkpatrick.
E11 0500  3    This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made
E11 0510  2    famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace
E11 0520  1    chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters.
E11 0520 11    (Gastronomes have long argued about which came first,
E11 0530  8    the Palace's or Antoine's. Antoine's held as mandatory
E11 0540  5    a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach
E11 0550  6    which was used for the underbedding. The Kirkpatrick
E11 0560  2    version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however,
E11 0570  1    held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it,
E11 0570 11    unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt, though
E11 0580  7    he did fancy a bit of lemon.
E11 0590  1       After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect
E11 0590 12    the rig; this was merely a ritual, to please all hands
E11 0600  9    concerned. The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300. A replica
E11 0610  6    of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club
E11 0620  3    in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it
E11 0630  1    was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One
E11 0630 12    could shave in the reflection of its French-polished
E11 0640  7    panels, and its axles were greased like those of roulette
E11 0650  5    wheels. The horses were groomed to a high gloss; departing,
E11 0660  3    they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw,
E11 0670  1    for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.
E11 0670 11       But for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip
E11 0680 11    fell. The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace
E11 0690  6    promptly at seven. They had been fed a hunting breakfast,
E11 0700  4    so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified with
E11 0710  2    fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of
E11 0710 13    making a kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here
E11 0720  9    is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's
E11 0730  6    kitchen:
E11 0730  7    #CLUB KEDGEREE#
E11 0730  9    Flake (for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock,
E11 0740  9    mix with a cupful of cooked rice, two minced hard-boiled
E11 0750  6    eggs, some buttery white sauce done with cream, cayenne,
E11 0760  4    pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of
E11 0770  1    minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and
E11 0770 11    serve hot on toast.
E11 0780  1    ##
E11 0780  2    The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's
E11 0780 10    chef, was even more in demand. For decades it was the
E11 0790 11    most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast,
E11 0800  8    and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still
E11 0810  6    survive. Native California oysters, salty and piquant,
E11 0820  4    as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a
E11 0830  1    five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula
E11 0830 10    goes thus:
E11 0830 12    #OMELET ARBOGAST#
E11 0840  2    Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful
E11 0850  1    of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs,
E11 0850 12    pepper, celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives,
E11 0860  8    a dash of cayenne, and a pinch of nutmeg. A jigger
E11 0870  6    of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture stiffens,
E11 0880  2    in go a hundred of the little oysters.
E11 0880 10       Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace,
E11 0890  8    and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he
E11 0900  4    introduced it at his restaurant in New York. J. Pierpont
E11 0910  3    Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco,
E11 0920  1    to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the
E11 0920  9    restaurateur with him. As things happened, Morgan was
E11 0930  8    installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend,
E11 0940  6    whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent.
E11 0950  2    Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused
E11 0950 11    himself as best he could. Twice he left everything
E11 0960  9    to his entourage, and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour
E11 0970  8    under Vernon's guidance.
E11 0980  1       In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its
E11 0980 11    tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the
E11 0990  7    maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's station was at
E11 1000  4    the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate
E11 1010  1    for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of
E11 1010 11    majestic build, rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled
E11 1020  7    the late General Winfield Scott, who was said to be
E11 1030  7    the most imposing general of his century, if not of
E11 1040  4    all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia,
E11 1050  1    and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant
E11 1050  9    jelly.
E11 1060  1       Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court
E11 1060 11    with twelve in the tallyho. He had style: he held his
E11 1070  9    reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked
E11 1080  6    Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned at a curve,
E11 1090  4    as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them.
E11 1100  1    They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until
E11 1100  9    the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands
E11 1110  7    begin.
E11 1110  8       The road maps of the region have changed since 1905;
E11 1120  9    inns have burned down, moved elsewhere, or taken other
E11 1130  5    names. Once on the road (and especially if the passengers
E11 1140  4    were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant
E11 1150  1    nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the
E11 1150  9    passengers of the tallyho, from which there issued
E11 1160  7    clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt his hat over one
E11 1170  5    ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard, indulging
E11 1180  2    in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they
E11 1180 13    were no more on parade than was their driver; one fork
E11 1190 10    of the road was as good as another. The Santa Cruz
E11 1200  7    mountains sprawl over three counties, and the roads
E11 1210  4    twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed
E11 1220  1    columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes
E11 1220 10    the Santa Clara valley below at the left. The water
E11 1230  8    splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery. You
E11 1240  4    arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted
E11 1250  1    not to bring a mackintosh.
E11 1250  6       Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the
E11 1260  7    establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.
E11 1270  1    A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they
E11 1270 11    were struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing
E11 1280  9    both the cooks and the management. He was copious in
E11 1290  6    his praise of those that served food that was good
E11 1300  3    to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct,
E11 1300 13    he used to say: such places invariably had stables
E11 1310  8    with superior feed bins.
E11 1320  1       There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees,
E11 1320  9    its wide verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its
E11 1330  8    sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet, and
E11 1340  6    lived there to the end of their days. It was the haunt
E11 1350  3    of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods.
E11 1350 11    Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs
E11 1360 10    (akin to Berkshires), whose "carcass sweepstakes" were
E11 1370  5    renowned. Their ham butts, cured in oak-log smoke,
E11 1380  5    were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served
E11 1390  1    with this original sauce:
E11 1390  5    #WRIGHT'S DEVIL SAUCE#
E11 1390  8    Put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy,
E11 1400 10    or of the boiled ham liquor, with a half stick of butter,
E11 1410  7    three teaspoonfuls of made mustard, and two mashed
E11 1420  4    garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato
E11 1430  1    and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After
E11 1430 10    this has simmered an hour, add two tablespoons each
E11 1440  7    of Worcestershire, catsup, and chutney, two pickled
E11 1450  4    walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen
E11 1460  1    minutes longer.
E11 1460  3    ##
E11 1460  4    Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed
E11 1470  3    at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar,
E11 1470 16    so that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.
E11 1480 10       Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's,
E11 1490  7    and deer were rather a nuisance; they leaped six-foot
E11 1500  5    fences with the agility of panthers. But no one complained
E11 1510  4    when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison
E11 1520  1    pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at
E11 1520 11    this altitude of two thousand feet, grapes acquire
E11 1530  7    a dryness and the tang of gunflint. (The Almaden vineyards
E11 1540  4    have now climbed to this height.) Apple trees grew
E11 1550  3    there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains
E11 1560  1    flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring,
E11 1560 11    the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle.
E11 1570  7       Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple
E11 1580  5    pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven fired
E11 1590  2    with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon
E11 1590 11    believed, was due more to its making than to the waning
E11 1600 11    heat of the oven. The recipe, which he got from the
E11 1610  6    baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically this:
E11 1620  2    #WRIGHT'S APPLE PIE#
E11 1620  5    Peel, core, and slice across enough apples to make
E11 1630  5    a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a saucepan
E11 1640  2    put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount
E11 1640 11    of sugar, a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot
E11 1650  8    preserve or jam, a pinch each of clove and nutmeg,
E11 1660  5    and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for twenty
E11 1670  2    minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup
E11 1670 11    for twelve minutes, drain them, and cool.
E11 1680  6       Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin, spread over
E11 1690  4    them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, with
E11 1700  2    as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a
E11 1700 12    fresh bay leaf, then lay on a cover of pastry, and
E11 1710  9    gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
