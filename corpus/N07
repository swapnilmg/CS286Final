N07 0010  1    The flat, hard cap was small, but he thrust it to the
N07 0010 13    back of his head.
N07 0020  1       "Tie him up".
N07 0020  4       "Hell with it".
N07 0020  7       Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped
N07 0030  8    forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered
N07 0040  7    head, hard. The man went over without sound, falling
N07 0050  4    to the bare floor.
N07 0050  8       Barton said harshly, "Why did you do that"?
N07 0060  6       Rankin sneered at him. "What did you want me to
N07 0070  6    do, kiss him? He dumped me in solitary twice".
N07 0080  1       Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung
N07 0080  9    him around.
N07 0090  2       "Let's get one thing straight, you and me. The only
N07 0100  2    reason we brought you was to get Miller out. If you
N07 0100 13    ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you".
N07 0110  7       Fred Rankin looked at him. It seemed to Barton that
N07 0120  8    the green eyes mocked him, the thin-lipped smile held
N07 0130  5    insolence, but he had no time to waste now.
N07 0140  1       "Come on. Let's move".
N07 0140  5       They filed out through the guard-room door, into
N07 0150  5    the paved square. There were three other men within
N07 0160  1    this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate,
N07 0160 10    but they were in other cell blocks. There was no chance.
N07 0170 10    They moved slowly, toward the main gate, following
N07 0180  5    the wall. There was no moon. They had chosen this night
N07 0190  4    purposely. They reached the guard house without alerting
N07 0200  1    the men on the walls above, and Powers slipped through
N07 0200 11    the door.
N07 0210  1       Two men were on duty inside, playing pinochle, relaxed.
N07 0210 10    They looked up in surprise as Powers came in.
N07 0220  9       "What are you doing out of the block"?
N07 0230  5       "It's Curtiss", he said, naming the man Rankin had
N07 0240  5    hit. "I've got to have help".
N07 0250  1       They stared at him. The sergeant in charge climbed
N07 0250  9    to his feet.
N07 0260  1       "What's wrong with him"?
N07 0260  5       "He's having some kind of a fit".
N07 0270  4       The sergeant turned to the door. As he passed through
N07 0280  1    it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side.
N07 0280 10       "One sound and you're dead".
N07 0290  5       The sergeant froze. Powers had not followed. Powers
N07 0300  4    was covering the remaining guard. The man half-reached
N07 0310  1    for the cord of the alarm bell. Powers knocked his
N07 0310 11    arm aside. Deliberately, with none of Rankin's viciousness,
N07 0320  7    he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's
N07 0330  7    head.
N07 0330  8       They were free. Even Barton could not quite believe
N07 0340  7    it. It had gone without a hitch. They slid through
N07 0350  4    the wicket in the big gate, ghosted across the dark
N07 0360  1    ground. Five minutes later they reached the horses.
N07 0360  9    Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett
N07 0370  8    Foster had brought extra mounts. He had been worried
N07 0380  5    that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party
N07 0390  3    they would be short.
N07 0390  7       No one hurried. They walked the horses, heading
N07 0400  4    along the river, Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead,
N07 0410  3    seven men riding quietly through the night.
N07 0410 10       The only thing which would have attracted attention
N07 0420  7    was that two wore the uniform of prison guards, three
N07 0430  5    the striped suits of convicts.
N07 0430 10       Five miles.
N07 0440  2       In a small grove against the river they halted,
N07 0440 11    turning deep into the protection of the trees. Foster
N07 0450  9    had brought extra clothing also. A good man, Emmett.
N07 0460  6    He had been one of the original Night Riders, one who
N07 0470  4    had escaped the trial. It was to him that Barton had
N07 0480  2    sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison.
N07 0490  1       Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself, shedding
N07 0490  8    his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript
N07 0500  6    butternut pants, the worn brown shirt. Kid Boyd was
N07 0510  4    unusually silent, Rankin watchful, a few paces apart.
N07 0520  1    Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand
N07 0520  9    to Powers.
N07 0530  1       "I won't even try to thank you".
N07 0530  8       The ex-prison guard was embarrassed. He said in
N07 0540  6    a studied voice, "I didn't do it for you. I did it
N07 0550  5    for the valley. You're the only man the Night Riders
N07 0560  1    will follow. We've been starving and I don't like to
N07 0560 11    starve".
N07 0570  1       Barton turned away, his eyes falling upon Rankin
N07 0570  9    beside his horse.
N07 0580  3       "Good luck".
N07 0580  5       The murderer lifted his head. "Meaning you want
N07 0590  4    me to ride out"?
N07 0590  8       "You aren't one of us. There's nothing for you here".
N07 0600  9       "I got no place to go".
N07 0610  3       Barton hesitated. He did not trust Rankin, his violent
N07 0620  2    temper, his killer instinct. But ten years in prison
N07 0620 11    had taught him realities. They were in a fight, outweighed
N07 0630  9    in both numbers and money. It was all right to put
N07 0640  8    a bunch of ranchers onto horses, to call them Night
N07 0650  4    Riders, to set out to attack the largest mining combination
N07 0660  1    the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.
N07 0660 12    But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals,
N07 0670 10    men who knew how to use a gun against men, who would
N07 0680 11    match the killers on the other side.
N07 0690  3       "Your choice", he said briefly, and turned to Kid
N07 0700  2    Boyd. "Bury those uniforms so they won't be found".
N07 0710  1       Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off,
N07 0710 10    up the river bank. He wanted a careful, uninterrupted
N07 0720  7    report from Dill on the conditions in the valley.
N07 0730  5       They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and
N07 0740  4    Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket, passing it
N07 0740 14    over silently. He too knew the agony of going for weeks,
N07 0750 11    sometimes months without the solace of tobacco.
N07 0760  6       Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply, letting
N07 0770  3    the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a
N07 0780  3    moment before he exhaled.
N07 0780  7       Through the gloom he could not see the man beside
N07 0790  5    him clearly but he knew him thoroughly. For his first
N07 0800  2    five years in prison, they had shared a cell.
N07 0800 11       Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man.
N07 0810  9    He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate, and
N07 0820  5    he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's
N07 0830  2    money. He had done time for the theft.
N07 0830 10       The one thing they had in common was their hatred.
N07 0840  9    Both hated Donald Kruger. It had drawn them together,
N07 0850  6    and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly
N07 0860  4    to effect this night's escape.
N07 0860  9       He said now, "I've got the perfect headquarters
N07 0870  7    set up. The old Haskell mine".
N07 0880  2       Mitch Barton knew the place. Twenty years before
N07 0890  1    a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims
N07 0890 11    in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley. They had
N07 0900  8    spent a million dollars, carving in a road, putting
N07 0910  5    up buildings, drilling their haulage tunnel. Then the
N07 0920  2    vein had petered out and the whole project had been
N07 0920 12    abandoned.
N07 0940  1       "The road's washed badly", said Dill, "but there's
N07 0940  9    a trail you can get over with a horse. A company of
N07 0950 12    cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding
N07 0960  9    that trail".
N07 0960 11       Barton nodded. "How do the valley people feel"?
N07 0970  8       "As mad as ever. But Kruger's men keep them off
N07 0980  7    balance, and they don't trust me. I'm an outsider.
N07 0990  5    When they learn you're in the hills though, they'll
N07 1000  2    rally, don't worry about that".
N07 1000  7       Barton waited for a long moment, then asked the
N07 1010  8    question which lay always uppermost in his mind.
N07 1020  4       "My boy. Did you find him"?
N07 1020 10       Dill was silent as if he hated to answer, and Barton
N07 1030 11    had a cold, sick feeling of apprehension.
N07 1040  3       "He's in Morgan's Ferry".
N07 1050  1       Barton half-straightened in surprise.
N07 1050  6       "What's he doing there"?
N07 1060  2       Again Dill hesitated. "Dealing faro".
N07 1070  1       "Dealing faro? How come"?
N07 1070  4       "Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres'
N07 1080  7    saloon".
N07 1080  8       Barton cursed under his breath. After another long
N07 1090  6    pause he asked, "How many people know who they are"?
N07 1100  5       "Everyone. Your cousin Finley saw to that. He's
N07 1110  4    quite a rat, you know. He sold out to Kruger's men.
N07 1120  1    He's informed them of everything you've ever written
N07 1120  9    him. He wants your ranch".
N07 1130  4       Barton stood up. He said tensely, "All right. Let's
N07 1140  3    go get the boy".
N07 1140  7       Dill had come up also. "I was afraid of this. I
N07 1150  6    almost didn't tell you".
N07 1150 10       "If you hadn't I'd have killed you".
N07 1160  7       Dill's voice tightened. "But you can't ride into
N07 1170  6    the Ferry. That's what they'll expect you to do. They'll
N07 1180  6    be there waiting for you. I understand how you feel
N07 1190  4    about the child ...".
N07 1190  8       "The hell you do". Barton's voice was rougher than
N07 1200  5    Dill had ever heard it. "I never saw him. My wife died
N07 1210  6    in childbirth after I was sent away.
N07 1220  1       "I can't leave him there. Donald Kruger would like
N07 1220  9    nothing better than to hold him as hostage, and I wouldn't
N07 1230 10    entrust a snake to his tender care. I've got to get
N07 1240  7    the boy. Let's ride".
N07 1240 11    #CHAPTER TWO#
N07 1250  2    BARTON'S MEN CUT the telegraph wires in half a dozen
N07 1260  1    places, carrying away whole sections to make repairs
N07 1260  9    more difficult. It was over an hour before their escape
N07 1270  8    was discovered, but still the news that Barton was
N07 1280  5    free flashed across the central portion of the state.
N07 1290  1       It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in
N07 1290 10    Burlingame. It reached the mines at North San Juan
N07 1300  9    and Bloomfield. It brought men out of bed and sent
N07 1310  8    them into hurried conferences.
N07 1320  1       For everyone involved knew that the whole valley
N07 1320  8    was a powder keg, and Mitchell Barton the fuse which
N07 1330  6    could send it into explosive violence.
N07 1340  1       Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione
N07 1340 10    pit. The office was of logs, four rooms, each heated
N07 1350  9    by an iron stove. The building was dwarfed by the scene
N07 1360  7    outside. There a dozen giant monitors played their
N07 1370  3    seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam
N07 1380  1    of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.
N07 1380  8       The gravel was the bed of an ancient river, buckled
N07 1390  8    in some prehistoric upheaval of earth. It was partially
N07 1400  5    cemented by ages and pressure, yet it crumpled before
N07 1410  2    the onslaught of the powerful streams, the force of
N07 1410 11    a thousand fire hoses, and with the gold it held washed
N07 1420 10    down through the long sluices. A million dollars' of
N07 1430  5    gold a month. A million tons of rock and soil and brush.
N07 1440  5       The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day. Their
N07 1450  2    roar, like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes
N07 1450 11    could be heard for miles. Hague, like all who worked
N07 1460 10    near the pits, was partly deafened from the constant
N07 1470  5    assault against his eardrums.
N07 1480  1       He was a big man, wearing a neat flannel shirt against
N07 1480 11    the cold foothill air. Fat showed in loose rolls beneath
N07 1490  8    the shirt. Ten years older than Mitch Barton, he had
N07 1500  6    clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager
N07 1510  3    of the operation.
N07 1510  6       He was proud of his accomplishments, proud of his
N07 1520  4    job, proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted
N07 1530  1    him. He lived and breathed for the mining company.
N07 1530 10       No man could have reached his spot nor held it without
N07 1540 11    being ruthless, and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness
N07 1550  8    all of his life.
N07 1550 12       There came a ghost of noise at the office door and
N07 1560 11    Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the
N07 1570  6    outer room. Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke.
N07 1580  4    The man was tall, thin, with a narrow face and a too-large
N07 1590  4    nose. The eyes always held Hague, eyes of a dead man,
N07 1590 15    lidless as a lizard's, with the fixed intensity of
N07 1600  9    a cobra. Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike
N07 1610  6    deadliness that was Kodyke.
N07 1620  1       He knew nothing about the man's history. Kodyke
N07 1620  8    had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from
N07 1630  8    Kruger. Kodyke was to head the dread company police.
N07 1640  4    He ran the change rooms. He threw out the hi-graders.
N07 1650  1    He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments
N07 1650  9    of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco.
N07 1660 10       Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike. He pulled
N07 1670  7    open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype.
N07 1680  6       "This is Mitchell Barton. He broke out of Folsom
N07 1690  4    last night. Apparently he bribed one of the guards.
N07 1700  1    We want him back there or we want him dead".
N07 1700 11       Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand, studying
N07 1710  7    it thoughtfully.
N07 1710  9       "Dangerous"?
N07 1720  1       "Dangerous, yes. You know how the ranchers in the
N07 1730  1    valley are. They blame us for all their troubles. Ten
N07 1730 11    years ago they blew up some of our ditches. It cost
N07 1740  9    us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost
N07 1750  5    time to fix them. We don't want Barton's Night Riders
N07 1760  2    loose again".
N07 1760  4       The gunman nodded, slipping the picture into his
N07 1770  3    breast pocket, saying nothing.
N07 1770  7       Normally Hague wasted no words, but now he found
N07 1780  8    himself unable to stop their flow although he knew
N07 1790  3    Kodyke was aware of all he said.
