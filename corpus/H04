H04 0010  1    _ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES._
H04 0010  6       The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of
H04 0020  5    employees on business dates back over forty years.
H04 0030  1    At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917.
H04 0030 11       The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles
H04 0040  7    in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940.
H04 0050  4       The automobile maintenance unit, or motor pool,
H04 0060  1    came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible
H04 0060 10    for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned
H04 0070  7    transportation since that time.
H04 0080  2       The motor pool has made exceptional progress in
H04 0080 10    automotive management including establishment of cost
H04 0090  6    billing systems, records keeping, analyses of vehicle
H04 0100  5    use, and effecting economies in vehicle operation.
H04 0110  2    Cars were operated in 1959 for an average .027@ per
H04 0110 12    mile.
H04 0120  1       Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly
H04 0120  8    to all state purchases. Unit prices to the state are
H04 0130  8    considerably lower than to the general public because
H04 0140  5    of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales
H04 0150  2    or federal excise taxes.
H04 0160  1    _VEHICLE PURCHASE, ASSIGNMENT AND USE POLICIES._
H04 0160  3       The legislature's role in policy determination concerning
H04 0170  1    state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively
H04 0170  9    to appropriating funds for vehicles.
H04 0180  5       The meaningful policies governing the purchase,
H04 0190  3    assignment, use and management of state vehicles have
H04 0200  1    been shaped by the state's administrative officers.
H04 0200  8       Meaningful policies include: (a) kinds of cars the
H04 0210  8    state should own, (b) when cars should be traded, (c)
H04 0220  7    the need and assignment of vehicles, (d) use of cars
H04 0230  5    in lieu of mileage allowances, (e) employees taking
H04 0230 13    cars home, and (f) need for liability insurance on
H04 0240  9    state automobiles.
H04 0250  1       A review of these policies indicates:
H04 0250  7    _(1)_
H04 0250  8       The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according
H04 0260  7    to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle.
H04 0270  7    _(2)_
H04 0270  8       The purchase of compact (economy) cars is being
H04 0280  4    made currently on a test basis.
H04 0280 10    _(3)_
H04 0280 11       Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in
H04 0290 10    the interest of economy.
H04 0300  1    _(4)_
H04 0300  1       The factors governing need and assignment of cars
H04 0300  9    are flexible according to circumstances.
H04 0310  4    _(5)_
H04 0310  5       Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high
H04 0320  5    mileage allowances with state automobiles.
H04 0330  1    _(6)_
H04 0330  1       It is reasonably economical for the state to have
H04 0330 10    drivers garage state cars at their homes.
H04 0340  6    _(7)_
H04 0340  7       The state has recently undertaken liability insurance
H04 0350  3    for drivers of state cars.
H04 0360  1    _AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES._
H04 0360  4       A survey of practices and/or policies in other states
H04 0370  2    concerning assignment and use of state automobiles
H04 0370  9    reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's
H04 0380  8    practices.
H04 0390  1       Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for
H04 0390  9    employees on state business. Two other states provide
H04 0400  6    vehicles, but only with legislative approval.
H04 0410  2       States which provide automobiles for employees assign
H04 0420  2    them variously to the agency, the individual, or to
H04 0420 11    a central pool.
H04 0430  1       Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for
H04 0430 10    acquisition, allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned
H04 0440  7    vehicles.
H04 0450  1       Nineteen states report laws, policies or regulations
H04 0450  8    for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage
H04 0460  7    allowances. Of these states the average "change-over"
H04 0470  4    point (at which a car is substituted for allowances)
H04 0480  1    is 13,200 miles per year.
H04 0480  6    _MILEAGE ALLOWANCES._
H04 0480  8       Mileage allowances for state employees are of two
H04 0490  8    types: (a) actual mileage and (b) fixed monthly allowances.
H04 0500  6       Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements
H04 0510  4    allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles
H04 0520  2    on state business at the rate of .07@ per mile. Fixed
H04 0530  1    monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same
H04 0530  8    purpose except on a non-itemized basis. Both allowances
H04 0540  8    are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth
H04 0550  4    in detail in the state's Travel Regulations.
H04 0560  1       Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of .07@ per mile
H04 0560  9    for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably
H04 0570  8    with other states' rates. The average of states' rates
H04 0580  7    is .076@ per mile.
H04 0590  1       Rhode Island's rate of .07@ per mile is considerably
H04 0590 10    lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government
H04 0600  7    and in industry nationally which approximate a .09@
H04 0610  5    per mile average.
H04 0610  8       Actual mileage allowances are well-administered
H04 0620  5    and not unduly expensive for the state. The travel
H04 0630  3    regulations, requirements and procedures governing
H04 0630  8    reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly
H04 0640  7    restrictive.
H04 0650  1       Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject.
H04 0650  8    They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and
H04 0660  8    payment. However, they lend themselves to abuse and
H04 0670  4    inadequate control measures. Flat payments over $50
H04 0680  2    per month are more expensive to the state than the
H04 0680 12    assignment of state-owned vehicles.
H04 0690  4    _TRAVEL ALLOWANCES._
H04 0690  6       Travel allowances, including subsistence, have been
H04 0700  4    revised by administrative officials recently and compare
H04 0710  3    favorably with other states' allowances. With few exceptions
H04 0720  2    travelers on state business are allowed actual travel
H04 0720 10    expenses and $15 per day subsistence. Travel allowances
H04 0730  8    are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration
H04 0740  7    and/or audit control.
H04 0750  1    #ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES#
H04 0750  5    _GENERAL BACKGROUND._
H04 0750  7       It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of
H04 0760 10    the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees
H04 0770  5    in Rhode Island. Few records are available concerning
H04 0780  2    the subject prior to 1940. Those that are available
H04 0790  1    shed little light. The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates
H04 0790 10    that at least one state automobile was registered as
H04 0800  9    far back as 1917. It should be enough to say that the
H04 0810  8    practice of the state buying automobiles is at least
H04 0820  4    forty years old.
H04 0820  7       The best reason that can be advanced for the state
H04 0830  5    adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway
H04 0840  2    construction during the 1920s and '30s. At that time
H04 0840 11    highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to
H04 0850  8    accomplish their duties. Using privately-owned vehicles
H04 0860  5    was a personal hardship for such employees, and the
H04 0870  3    matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly
H04 0880  1    justifiable.
H04 0880  2       Once the principle was established, the increase
H04 0890  1    in state-owned vehicles came rapidly. And reasons other
H04 0890 10    than employee need contributed to the growth. Table
H04 0900  7    1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles
H04 0910  7    and employees. This rate of increase does not signify
H04 0920  4    anything in itself. It does not indicate loose management,
H04 0930  1    ineffective controls or poor policy. But it does show
H04 0930 10    that automobiles have increased steadily over the years
H04 0940  7    and in almost the same proportion to the increase of
H04 0950  6    state employees. In the past twenty years the ratio
H04 0960  4    of state-owned automobiles per state employees has
H04 0960 12    varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now. Whether there
H04 0970 13    were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is
H04 0980  8    problematical. The fact is simply that state-owned
H04 0990  4    vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion
H04 1000  1    as employees to use them.
H04 1010  1    _HISTORY AND OPERATION OF THE MOTOR POOL._
H04 1010  2       While the origin of state-owned automobiles may
H04 1010 10    be obscured, subsequent developments concerning the
H04 1020  5    assignment, use, and management of state automobiles
H04 1030  4    can be related more clearly. Prior to 1942, automobiles
H04 1040  2    were the individual responsibility of the agency to
H04 1040 10    which assigned. This responsibility included all phases
H04 1050  7    of management. It embraced determining when to purchase
H04 1060  6    and when to trade vehicles, who was to drive, when
H04 1070  5    and where repairs were to be made, where gasoline and
H04 1080  2    automobile services were to be obtained and other allied
H04 1080 11    matters. In 1942, however, the nation was at war. Gasoline
H04 1090 10    and automobile tires were rationed commodities. The
H04 1100  5    state was confronted with transportation problems similar
H04 1110  3    to those of the individual. It met these problems by
H04 1120  2    the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit
H04 1120 10    (more popularly called the motor pool), a centralized
H04 1130  7    operation for the maintenance and control of all state
H04 1140  6    transportation. The motor pool then, as now, had headquarter
H04 1150  5    facilities in Providence and other garages located
H04 1160  1    throughout the state. It was organizationally the responsibility
H04 1170  1    of the Department of Public Works and was financed
H04 1170 10    on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government
H04 1180  7    contributing to the pool's operation. In 1951 the pool's
H04 1190  5    operation was transferred to the newly-created Department
H04 1200  2    of Administration, an agency established as the central
H04 1210  2    staff and auxiliary department of the state government.
H04 1210 10    The management of state-owned vehicles since that time
H04 1220  8    has been described in a recent report in the following
H04 1230  7    manner: "
H04 1230  8       Under this new management considerable progress
H04 1240  4    appears to have been made. The agencies of government
H04 1250  3    are now billed for the actual cost of services provided
H04 1260  1    to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform
H04 1260 10    charge for all cars. Whereas the maintenance rotary
H04 1270  6    fund had in the past sustained losses considerably
H04 1280  3    beyond expectations, the introduction of the cost-billing
H04 1290  1    system plus other control refinements has resulted
H04 1290  8    in keeping the fund on a proper working basis. One
H04 1300  9    indication of the merits of the new management is found
H04 1310  6    in the fact that during the period 1951-1956, while
H04 1320  2    total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased
H04 1320 10    35%, the total maintenance cost increased only 11%.
H04 1330  7    "
H04 1330  7       In order to further refine the management of passenger
H04 1340  8    vehicles, on July 1, 1958, the actual title to every
H04 1350  6    vehicle was transferred, by Executive Order, to the
H04 1360  4    Division of Methods, Research and Office Services.
H04 1370  1    The objective behind this action was to place in one
H04 1370 11    agency the responsibility for the management, assignment,
H04 1380  5    and replacement of all vehicles. (Note: So far as State
H04 1390  6    Police cars are concerned, only their replacement is
H04 1400  3    under this division). This tied in closely with the
H04 1410  1    current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the
H04 1410 10    extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point
H04 1420  7    where maintenance costs (in light of depreciation)
H04 1430  3    become excessive. Moreover, it allows the present management
H04 1440  1    to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly
H04 1450  1    distributed throughout the fleet; for example, if one
H04 1450  9    driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver
H04 1460  8    8,000 miles per year, their cars will be switched so
H04 1470  6    that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years,
H04 1480  2    rather than 44,000 miles (and related higher maintenance
H04 1480 10    costs) and 16,000 miles respectively".
H04 1490  5       The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized
H04 1500  4    operation. It handles all types of vehicle maintenance,
H04 1510  3    but concentrates more on "service station activities"
H04 1520  1    than on extensive vehicle repairs. It contracts with
H04 1520  9    outside repair garages for much of the latter work.
H04 1530  9    Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance
H04 1540  6    and cost-data studies and analyses. Pool records reveal
H04 1550  4    in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of
H04 1560  2    each vehicle, the miles traveled in one year or three
H04 1560 12    years, the periods when vehicle costs become excessive,
H04 1570  6    and when cars should be traded for sound economies.
H04 1580  4    From this, motor pool personnel develop other meaningful
H04 1590  2    and related data. In 1959-60, vehicles averaged an
H04 1590 11    operating cost of .027@ per mile. Based on this figure
H04 1600 10    and considering depreciation costs of vehicles, pool
H04 1610  5    personnel have determined that travel in excess of
H04 1620  4    10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car
H04 1630  1    than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned
H04 1630 11    vehicles. They estimate further that with sufficient
H04 1640  6    experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled,
H04 1650  6    the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles
H04 1660  3    of travel per year. Table 2 shows operating cost data
H04 1660 13    of state vehicles selected at random.
H04 1670  6       One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness
H04 1680  4    of pool operations is the lack of adequate central
H04 1690  2    garage facilities. Present pool quarters at two locations
H04 1690 10    in Providence are crowded, antiquated and, in general,
H04 1700  8    make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement
H04 1710  6    of personnel and duplication of such operational needs
H04 1720  4    as stock and repair equipment. Good facilities would
H04 1730  2    be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce
H04 1730 12    vehicle costs even more.
H04 1740  4    _PURCHASING PRACTICES._
H04 1740  6       The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled
H04 1750  4    in the same manner as all other purchases of the state.
H04 1760  4    Requests are made by the motor pool along with any
H04 1760 14    necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments
H04 1770  8    of cars will be made. Bids are evaluated by the Division
H04 1780  9    of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff, and
H04 1790  6    awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made
H04 1800  3    to the lowest responsible bidders. Unit prices for
H04 1800 11    state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general
H04 1810  9    public. The reasons are obvious: (1) the state is buying
H04 1820  8    in quantity, and (2) it has no federal excise or state
H04 1830  5    sales tax to pay. Until 1958 the state was also entitled
H04 1840  2    to a special type of manufacturers' discount through
H04 1840 10    the dealers.
H04 1850  2       In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the
H04 1850 11    state motor pool, cars are paid for with funds appropriated
H04 1860 10    to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund
H04 1870  7    mentioned earlier. This is a normal governmental procedure
H04 1880  3    which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles.
H04 1890  2    The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is
H04 1900  1    another matter to be covered in detail later.
H04 1900  9    #VEHICLE PURCHASE, ASSIGNMENT, AND USE POLICIES#
H04 1910  5    Probably the most important of all matters for review
H04 1920  3    are the broad administrative policies governing the
H04 1920 10    purchase, assignment, use, and management of state
H04 1930  7    vehicles. The legislature's role in policy determination
H04 1940  5    in this area for years has been confined almost solely
H04 1950  4    to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the
H04 1960  3    purchase and operation of vehicles. The more meaningful
H04 1960 11    policies have been left to the judgment of the chief
H04 1970 10    administrative officer of the state- the Director of
H04 1980  7    Administration.
