H28 0010  1    Following the term of service in Japan, each emissary
H28 0010 10    returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret
H28 0020  8    his experience to the college community. The Carleton
H28 0030  4    Service Fund provides the financial support for this
H28 0040  3    program.
H28 0040  4    #MUSICAL ACTIVITIES#
H28 0040  6    THE COLLEGE was one of the first to recognize the importance
H28 0050  8    of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum
H28 0060  5    but as a vital adjunct to campus life. Extensive facilities
H28 0070  2    for group performance are provided by maintaining,
H28 0070  9    under skilled direction, the Choir, the Orchestra,
H28 0080  7    the Band, the Glee Club, and smaller ensembles of wind
H28 0090  7    and string players.
H28 0090 10       All students are invited to participate in any of
H28 0100  9    the musical organizations for which they qualify. Orchestra,
H28 0110  6    Band, and Choir have auditions during the week preceding
H28 0120  5    the first day of classes. The Glee Club is open to
H28 0130  4    all students and faculty with no auditions necessary
H28 0130 12    for membership.
H28 0140  2       In addition to the many appearances of these organizations
H28 0150  1    throughout the college year, there are concerts by
H28 0150  9    students of the music department, by members of the
H28 0160  8    music faculty, and by visiting artists.
H28 0170  2       Student musical organizations are the Knights of
H28 0180  1    Carleton and the Overtones (men's vocal groups), and
H28 0180  9    the Keynotes (a women's singing group). These student-directed
H28 0190  8    organizations include eight to ten members each; they
H28 0200  7    perform at many campus social events.
H28 0210  2    #RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES#
H28 0210  4    FROM THE FOUNDING of the College those responsible
H28 0220  3    for its management have planned to provide its students
H28 0230  2    favorable conditions for personal religious development
H28 0230  8    and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and
H28 0240  7    otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance
H28 0250  5    of religion. Courses are offered in ethics, the philosophy
H28 0260  4    and history of religion, Christian thought and history,
H28 0270  2    and the Bible. Carleton aims throughout its entire
H28 0270 10    teaching program to represent a point of view and a
H28 0280 10    spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious
H28 0290  6    development of its students.
H28 0300  1       A COLLEGE SERVICE OF WORSHIP is held each Sunday
H28 0300  9    morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel. The sermons
H28 0310  7    are given by the College Chaplain, by members of the
H28 0320  5    faculty, or by guest preachers. Music is furnished
H28 0330  1    by the Carleton College Choir.
H28 0330  6       CHAPEL SERVICES are held weekly. These services
H28 0340  6    at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain,
H28 0350  5    by the President of the College, by selected faculty
H28 0360  2    members, students, and visitors. The service is brief
H28 0360 10    and variety in forms of worship is practiced.
H28 0370  7       A SUNDAY EVENING PROGRAM provides theological lectures,
H28 0380  4    music, drama, and films related to the issues of the
H28 0390  6    Judeo-Christian tradition.
H28 0390  9       ATTENDANCE is required at the College Service of
H28 0400  8    Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any
H28 0410  6    regularly organized service of public worship. Each
H28 0420  3    semester every student must attend ten of the services
H28 0430  1    or religious meetings. Attendance at the Chapel Service
H28 0430  9    is voluntary.
H28 0440  1       RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS include the groups described
H28 0450  1    below. The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected
H28 0460  3    with the corresponding national organizations and carry
H28 0470  1    out their general purposes. Occasional meetings are
H28 0470  8    held for the whole membership, usually with a guest
H28 0490  7    speaker, while smaller discussion groups meet more
H28 0500  4    frequently. The Associations sponsor many traditional
H28 0510  1    campus events and provide students with opportunities
H28 0510  8    to form new friendships, to broaden their interests,
H28 0520  6    and to engage in worthwhile service projects.
H28 0530  3       There are other organizations representing several
H28 0540  2    of the denominational groups. Included are the following:
H28 0540 10    Baptist Student Movement, Canterbury Club (Episcopal),
H28 0550  6    Christian Science Organization, Friends' Meeting for
H28 0560  6    Worship, Hillel (Jewish), Liberal Religious Fellowship,

H28 0580  5    Presbyterian Student Fellowship, United Student Fellowship
H28 0590  4    (Congregational-Baptist), and Wesley Fellowship (Methodist).
H28 0600  3       Student religious organizations are co-ordinated
H28 0610  4    under the Religious Activities Committee, a standing
H28 0620  1    committee of the Carleton Student Association.
H28 0620  7       THE NORTHFIELD CHURCHES include the following: Alliance,
H28 0630  6    Congregational-Baptist, Episcopal, Lutheran (Norwegian,
H28 0640  4    Danish, Missouri Synod, and Bethel), Methodist, Moravian,
H28 0650  5    Pentecostal, and Roman Catholic.
H28 0660  1    #THEATER#
H28 0660  2    THE PURPOSE of producing plays at the College is three-fold:
H28 0670  4    to provide the Carleton students with the best possible
H28 0680  1    opportunity for theater-going within the limits set
H28 0680  9    by the maturity and experience of the performers and
H28 0690  7    the theatrical facilities available; to encourage the
H28 0700  4    practice of attending the theater; and to develop a
H28 0710  4    discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive
H28 0710 11    performance.
H28 0720  1       Dramatic activity at the College is organized and
H28 0720  9    carried on by The Carleton Players, which is to say
H28 0730 10    by all students who are so inclined to advance these
H28 0740  7    aims.
H28 0740  8       For the 1960-1961 season, The Carleton Players have
H28 0750  4    announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca, The
H28 0760  4    Knight of the Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher
H28 0770  3    and A Moon for the Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill, with
H28 0780  2    a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee
H28 0790  1    Williams.
H28 0790  2    #STUDENT WORKSHOP#
H28 0790  4    THIS workshop, located in Boliou Hall, provides facilities
H28 0800  6    for students to work in ceramics, weaving, enameling,
H28 0810  3    welding, woodworking, textile printing, printmaking,
H28 0820  1    and lapidary. These extra-curricular activities are
H28 0820  8    conducted under supervision of the Director of the
H28 0830  8    Student Workshop. The workshop is open five afternoons
H28 0840  6    and two evenings each week.
H28 0850  1       A student organization, Bottega, is open to any
H28 0850  9    student interested in increasing his understanding
H28 0860  4    and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in
H28 0870  3    their historical, technical, and productive contexts.
H28 0870  9    The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop.
H28 0880 11    They are assisted and advised by members of the Art
H28 0890  9    Department.
H28 0890 10    #ATHLETICS#
H28 0900  1    THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM at Carleton is considered an integral
H28 0910  1    part of the activities of the College and operates
H28 0910 10    under the same budgetary procedure and controls as
H28 0920  6    the academic work.
H28 0920  9       The physical education program for men recognizes
H28 0930  6    the value of participation in competitive sports in
H28 0940  5    the development of the individual student and aims
H28 0950  2    to give every man an opportunity to enter some form
H28 0950 12    of athletic competition, either intercollegiate or
H28 0960  5    intramural.
H28 0960  6       The same standards for admission, for eligibility
H28 0970  5    to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid, and for scholastic
H28 0980  4    performance at college apply to all students.
H28 0990  1       A faculty committee on athletics, responsible to
H28 0990  8    the faculty as a whole, exercises control over the
H28 1000  8    athletic program of the College. It concerns itself
H28 1010  4    with:
H28 1010  5    _1._
H28 1010  6       The policies which govern the program
H28 1020  3    _2._
H28 1020  4       The preservation of desirable balance between the
H28 1030  2    athletic and academic programs of the College
H28 1030  9    _3._
H28 1030 10       The approval of athletic schedules
H28 1040  4    _4._
H28 1040  5       The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility
H28 1050  2    standards
H28 1050  3       Carleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic
H28 1060  3    Conference and abides by its eligibility rules. In
H28 1070  2    addition to these rules, Carleton has added the following:
H28 1080  1    _1._
H28 1080  2       A student who while in attendance at Carleton College
H28 1080 11    participates in an athletic contest during the school
H28 1090  8    year, other than that sponsored by the College, shall
H28 1100  6    be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate
H28 1110  3    athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent
H28 1120  3    suspension from the institution. The school year does
H28 1130  1    not end for any student until he has completed his
H28 1130 11    last examination of the semester.
H28 1140  4    _2._
H28 1140  5       A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any
H28 1150  3    Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least
H28 1150 13    1.00.
H28 1160  1       THE "C" CLUB is composed of the men of the College
H28 1170  1    who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics.
H28 1170 10    The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic
H28 1180  9    teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them
H28 1190  5    among the student body. This is done by encouraging
H28 1200  1    the entire male student body to participate in either
H28 1200 10    the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and
H28 1210  6    by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders.
H28 1220  2    _SOCCER CLUB._
H28 1220  4       The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men
H28 1230  4    interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport.
H28 1240  1    Membership consists of both beginners and experienced
H28 1240  8    players. Practices are held regularly and the schedule
H28 1250  7    of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers
H28 1260  7    of the club.
H28 1270  1    _WOMEN'S RECREATION ASSOCIATION._
H28 1270  2       This Association, organized in 1920, is affiliated
H28 1280  1    with the Athletic Federation of College Women. The
H28 1280  9    purpose of the organization is to further the interest
H28 1290  7    of women students in recreational activities as a means
H28 1300  5    of promoting physical efficiency, sportsmanship, and
H28 1310  2    "play for play's sake". The Association is governed
H28 1320  1    by a board made up of representatives from each of
H28 1320 11    the four classes. Membership is open to any woman student
H28 1330  8    in the College. Active groups sponsored by the organization
H28 1340  5    include the Saddle Club, Orchesis, Golf Club, Tennis
H28 1350  4    Club, and Dolphins. The Saddle Club, open to students
H28 1360  2    proficient in horsemanship, presents the Annual Spring
H28 1360  9    Riding Exhibition, and during the year it offers speakers,
H28 1370  9    movies, breakfast rides, and trips to broaden their
H28 1380  7    knowledge of the sport. Orchesis, for students interested
H28 1390  4    in the modern dance, contributes to the May Fete and
H28 1400  4    offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration.
H28 1410  1    Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament
H28 1410  9    with the University of Minnesota each fall, and also
H28 1420  7    sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at
H28 1430  4    Carleton in May. The Dolphins present a three-night
H28 1450  1    water show the week of the May Fete. Under the auspices
H28 1450 12    of the Women's Recreation Association, interclass competition
H28 1460  7    is organized in badminton, basketball, field hockey,
H28 1470  6    golf, tennis, and swimming. The Association participates
H28 1480  4    in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several
H28 1490  3    Play Days with St. Olaf and other near-by colleges.
H28 1500  1    With the co-operation of the Department of Physical
H28 1500 10    Education for Men, the Women's Recreation Association
H28 1510  7    arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the
H28 1520  7    fall and spring. Throughout the year there are social
H28 1530  4    events, such as picnics, breakfast hikes, canoe trips,
