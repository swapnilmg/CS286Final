J39 0010  1       But briefly, the topping configuration must be examined
J39 0010  9    for its inferences. Then the fact that the lower channel
J39 0020  9    line was pierced had further forecasting significance.
J39 0030  4    And then the application of the count rules to the
J39 0040  5    width (horizontally) of the configuration give us an
J39 0050  1    intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline.
J39 0050 10    The very idea of their being "count rules" implies
J39 0060  7    that there is some sort of proportion to be expected
J39 0070  4    between the amount of congestive activity and the extent
J39 0080  3    of the breakaway (run up or run down) movement. This
J39 0080 13    expectation is what really "sold" point and figure.
J39 0090  8    But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable
J39 0100  4    relationship in the strictest sense. Experience will
J39 0110  3    show that only the vaguest generalities apply, and
J39 0120  1    in fine, these merely dwell upon a relationship between
J39 0120 10    the durations and intensities of events. After all,
J39 0130  7    too much does not happen too suddenly, nor does very
J39 0140  5    little take long.
J39 0140  8       The advantages and disadvantages of these two types
J39 0150  5    of charting, bar charting and point and figure charting,
J39 0160  3    remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation
J39 0170  1    among their respective professional advocates, with
J39 0170  7    both methods enjoying in common, one irrevocable merit.
J39 0180  6    They are both trend-following methods. Even if we strip
J39 0190  6    their respective claims to the barest minimum, the
J39 0200  2    "odds" still favor them both, for the trend in effect
J39 0200 12    is always more likely to continue than to reverse.
J39 0210  8       Of course, many more things are charted besides
J39 0220  6    prices. The foregoing have been methods of charting
J39 0230  3    prices, but now let us look at some of the other indices
J39 0240  1    that are customarily charted, and which are looked
J39 0240  9    to for their forecasting abilities.
J39 0250  2    _THE QUEST FOR METHODS_
J39 0250  6       The search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless.
J39 0260  4    Correlations have been worked up between the loading
J39 0270  3    of freight cars and the course of stock price. The
J39 0270 13    theory behind this is, of course, fundamentalist in
J39 0280  8    character. As the number of reported freight car loadings
J39 0290  6    increased, this was taken to indicate increased industrial
J39 0300  3    activity, and consequently increased stock earnings,
J39 0310  1    implying fatter dividends, and implying therefore increased
J39 0310  8    stock market prices. We now know that things rarely
J39 0320  9    ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion, and that
J39 0330  7    car loadings, while perhaps interesting enough, are
J39 0340  3    nevertheless not the magic formula that will always
J39 0340 11    turn before stock prices turn.
J39 0350  5       But the quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly,
J39 0360  4    with all manner of investors and speculators participating,
J39 0370  1    ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually
J39 0370  8    to the proverbial shoe-string operator, all seeking
J39 0380  7    doggedly, studiously, daily- and often nightly- for
J39 0390  7    the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal
J39 0400  3    secret: Which way will the market move; up or down?
J39 0410  1    It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the
J39 0410 12    fountain of youth, a quest heavily invested in, during
J39 0420  7    the days of wooden ships. Just as heavily invested
J39 0430  4    are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry
J39 0440  2    on the quest for the enchanting index. The quest offers
J39 0440 12    careers. Much of this goes on in offices high up in
J39 0450 11    Wall Street's lofty wind-swept towers.
J39 0460  4       There sit men who make moving averages of weekly
J39 0470  2    volume, monthly averages of price-earnings ratios,
J39 0470  9    ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines,
J39 0480 10    ratios of an individual stock's performance to overall
J39 0490  5    market performance, ratios of rising price volume to
J39 0500  4    falling price volume, odd-lot indices, and what not.
J39 0510  1    They are concerned with all things traded in, securities,
J39 0510 10    bonds, cocao, coffee, soybeans, cotton, tin, oats,
J39 0520  6    etc.
J39 0520  7       And along Chicago's West Jackson Boulevard, La Salle
J39 0530  6    Street, and around the Merchandise Mart Plaza there
J39 0540  5    sit men who chart crop reports, who divide the number
J39 0550  3    of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs,
J39 0560  1    and the number of hogs by the amount of corn. They
J39 0560 12    plot the open interest curves, rainfall curves, and
J39 0570  6    they even divide Democratic congressmen by Republican
J39 0580  4    congressmen. All these things and countless more enter
J39 0590  3    into their calculations, and yet, the enchanting index
J39 0590 11    remains non-forthcoming. Not, at any rate, in the fuller
J39 0600 10    sense of the word.
J39 0610  1       The markets are far too subtle, and the last word
J39 0610 11    in these endeavors will doubtless never be written,
J39 0620  7    for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the
J39 0630  7    fountain of youth.
J39 0630 10       But whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain,
J39 0640  7    they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting
J39 0650  4    index.
J39 0650  5       We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago.
J39 0660  4    In the stock market, the normal trading package is
J39 0670  2    a hundred shares, just as 5,000 bushels is the standard
J39 0670 12    grain contract package. A stock transaction for less
J39 0680  7    than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot
J39 0690  6    broker on the floor of the exchange. This results in
J39 0700  3    a separate record being made, distinguishing these
J39 0700 10    trades from the overall volume of trading.
J39 0710  7       According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices,
J39 0720  4    the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small
J39 0730  3    trader, one who can't afford to trade round lots. Or,
J39 0730 13    to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index
J39 0740 10    enthusiast, they represent a sampling of the least
J39 0750  6    sophisticated echelon of traders. Falling most easily
J39 0760  3    prey to an adverse market movement, for this rank of
J39 0760 13    traders can least afford to lose, virtually anything
J39 0770  8    the odd-lot traders do, marketwise, is taken to exemplify
J39 0780  7    the "wrong" thing to do.
J39 0790  1       Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases
J39 0790  9    and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange
J39 0800  7    and carried in the newspapers. Odd-lot index observers
J39 0810  5    then make graphs of the data according to their particular
J39 0820  2    statistical recipe. They might, for example, plot it
J39 0820 10    exactly as is, or they might make ten day moving averages
J39 0830 11    of it, or longer moving averages, or they might simply
J39 0840  7    plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales.
J39 0850  5    The particular recipe is a matter of individual taste.
J39 0860  2    The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price
J39 0870  1    chart, usually of a popular stock average.
J39 0870  8       Towards the end of an intermediate or major rise,
J39 0880  6    while the top is forming on the price chart, it is
J39 0890  4    frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases
J39 0890 12    sharply. This warns the chartist that the formation
J39 0900  8    in progress is quite likely to be a top. Similarly,
J39 0910  7    at the opposite end of the market cycle, towards the
J39 0920  3    end of an intermediate or major decline, usually while
J39 0930  1    the bottom is being formed on the price chart, it is
J39 0930 12    characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot
J39 0940  9    selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is
J39 0950  5    becoming a greater likelihood. Thus, in the aggregate,
J39 0960  1    the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and
J39 0960 13    sells at the bottoms, notwithstanding occasional individual
J39 0970  5    exceptions.
J39 0970  6       While it had long been known in general, that "the
J39 0980 10    public is always wrong", the use of odd-lot indices
J39 0990  7    now puts the adage on a statistical basis.
J39 1000  2       One might well wonder why the "public is always
J39 1000 11    wrong" and the question raised is about as awkward
J39 1010  9    as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg.
J39 1020  7    Which came first? Is it really that the "public" buys
J39 1030  4    at the tops, and not that the market tops out when
J39 1040  1    the "public" buys? And the converse at bottoms. Does
J39 1040 10    the "public" usually sell at bottoms, or does the market
J39 1050  9    usually bottom out when the "public" sells?
J39 1060  6       We have been using the word "public" in quotation
J39 1070  4    marks, that is, in its vernacular connotation with
J39 1080  2    reference to the odd-lot index theory. Obviously someone
J39 1080 11    has to sell in order for someone to buy, and vice versa.
J39 1090 12    And while all concerned are members of the literal
J39 1100  6    public, somewhat less than all concerned, although
J39 1110  2    still a majority, form the quotation marked "public".
J39 1120  1    And the public minus the "public" leaves the so-called
J39 1120 11    "sophisticated" element- the element on the other end
J39 1130  7    of the "public's" transactions.
J39 1140  2       This element is often called "strong hands". Strong
J39 1150  3    hands differ from "weak hands" in that their operations
J39 1160  1    are the primary movers. They initiate campaigns, so
J39 1160  9    to speak, even if this initiation is diffused among
J39 1170  8    them, and their concerted action only psychologically
J39 1180  3    organized. Strong hands act; weak hands react. Strong
J39 1190  3    hands move first; weak hands ask, What is going on?
J39 1200  1    When strong hands buy, they are able to buy more, and
J39 1200 12    they do it even in the face of bearish news reports.
J39 1210  8    They are able to sit more patiently with what they
J39 1220  4    have bought. Needless to say, strong hands are not
J39 1230  2    eager to be joined by weak hands, for this increases
J39 1230 12    the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak
J39 1240  9    hands unload on the way up, at higher prices, during
J39 1250  5    the run-up phase of the campaign.
J39 1250 12       Certain badly disillusioned market critics are often
J39 1260  7    apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair,
J39 1270  5    dirty, or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay
J39 1280  3    of competitive forces. But after all, can anyone imagine
J39 1290  1    a market wherein the reverse of these things were true?
J39 1290 11    Try to imagine a market in which only a minority of
J39 1300 10    traders would lose, and the majority would make consistent
J39 1310  6    profits. How much and how many profits could a majority
J39 1320  4    take out of the losses of a few?
J39 1320 12       Moreover, the taunt concerning the "sophisticated"
J39 1330  6    echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during
J39 1340  7    every campaign, and accrues only upon results; not
J39 1350  4    before. It quite often happens that campaigns go askew,
J39 1360  2    resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong
J39 1360 10    hands into played-out hands, just as a member of a
J39 1370 11    former campaign's "public" may emerge flatteringly
J39 1380  4    "right" the next time. Membership in the echelons fluctuates
J39 1390  5    too.
J39 1390  6       The study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to
J39 1400  5    the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow,
J39 1410  1    what with all observers trying to get on the side of
J39 1410 12    the "few" at the same time. The usefulness of this
J39 1420  9    study and of configuration analysis as well, declines
J39 1430  5    in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use.
J39 1440  4    It has to, by virtue of the very dictionary definition
J39 1440 14    of the word "few".
J39 1450  4       Diametric opposition must persist as to the future
J39 1460  3    course of prices, if there is to persist a market at
J39 1460 14    all. And the few must win what the many lose, for the
J39 1470 11    opposite arrangement would not support markets as we
J39 1480  7    know them at all, and is, in fact, unimaginable. There
J39 1490  2    need be no squeamishness about admitting this. Anyone
J39 1500  1    still doubting that this is the only way markets can
J39 1500 11    be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the
J39 1510  9    majority consistently wins what the minority loses.
J39 1520  4       Mr. John Magee, whose work has been discussed in
J39 1530  2    this chapter, was quoted in a New Yorker magazine profile
J39 1540  1    as saying- "... Of course, you have to remember it's
J39 1540 11    a good thing for us chartists that there aren't more
J39 1550  8    of us. If you got too many people investing by this
J39 1560  6    method, their operations would begin to affect stock
J39 1570  3    prices, and thus throw the charts off. The method would
J39 1580  1    become self-defeating".
J39 1580  4       Mr. Alexander H. Wheelan's Study Helps in Point
J39 1590  5    and Figure Technique tells the readers- "We assure
J39 1600  2    you that the total number of people using this method
J39 1600 12    of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum
J39 1610 11    total of those operating in the securities and commodities
J39 1620  6    markets".
J39 1620  7       What with traders trading for so many different
J39 1630  7    objectives, and what with there being so many unique
J39 1640  5    and individualized market theories and trading techniques
J39 1650  2    in use, and more coming into use all the time, it is
J39 1650 14    hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique
J39 1660  8    could acquire enough "fans" to invalidate itself. Nevertheless,
J39 1670  6    all theories and techniques lead but to one of two
J39 1680  7    possible modes of expression, if they lead to a market
J39 1690  4    committment at all. In the final analysis, then, the
J39 1690 13    user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance,
J39 1700 12    notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation,
J39 1710  7    however elaborate. Thus while his theory or technique
J39 1720  6    may not be oversubscribed, it is commonplace for bullish
J39 1730  3    and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed.
J39 1740  1    Though the methods of deciding may be profound and
J39 1740 10    diverse, the possible conclusions remain but two.
J39 1750  6    #CHAPTER VI MORE METHODS#
J39 1760  1    _THE HOAXES_
J39 1760  3       The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book
J39 1770  1    was first to introduce the reader to a general background
J39 1770 11    knowledge of the various types and capabilities of
J39 1780  8    the forecasting methods already in use, so that he
J39 1790  6    might then be in a position to evaluate for himself
J39 1800  1    the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation
J39 1800  9    that is to follow, and to appraise the forecast that
J39 1810 10    its interpretation suggests for the future of farm
J39 1820  6    prices over the years immediately ahead.
