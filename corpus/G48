G48 0010  1    He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements
G48 0010 10    but nothing of the final, desperate rush to come to
G48 0020  8    grips with the enemy. When the victory cheer went up
G48 0030  5    this officer found himself still mounted, with his
G48 0040  1    horse pressed broadside against Cleburne's log parapet
G48 0040  8    in a tangled group of infantrymen. His hat was gone,
G48 0050  8    the tears were streaming from his eyes. He never knew
G48 0060  7    how he got there. Six climactic minutes in an individual's
G48 0070  4    life left no memory.
G48 0070  8       Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered
G48 0080  3    within their works and a thousand more were captured
G48 0090  2    or surrendered themselves that night and the next day.
G48 0090 11    Eight field guns were captured in position. Seven battle
G48 0100  9    flags and fourteen officers' swords were sent to Thomas'
G48 0110  7    headquarters. It was the only sizable assault upon
G48 0120  6    infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully
G48 0130  2    made by either side during the Atlanta campaign. The
G48 0140  1    Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third
G48 0140  9    of its numbers within a few minutes, among them being
G48 0150  8    several men whose time of service had expired but who
G48 0160  5    had volunteered to advance with their regiment. The
G48 0170  2    Thirty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, one of the
G48 0170 11    regiments in Thomas' First Division during Buell's
G48 0180  7    command, suffered its greatest loss of the war in this
G48 0190  9    action.
G48 0190 10       A popular belief grew up after the war that the
G48 0200  8    only time during the Civil War that Thomas ever put
G48 0210  4    his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up
G48 0220  1    Stanley for this assault. Sherman was responsible for
G48 0220  9    the story when he said in his memoirs that this was
G48 0230  9    the only time he could recall seeing Thomas ride so
G48 0240  5    fast. While Thomas' injured back led him to restrain
G48 0250  2    his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly
G48 0250 12    enough when he had to. It is not in the record, but
G48 0260 12    he must have galloped his horse at Peach Tree Creek
G48 0270  6    when he brought up Ward's guns to save Newton's crumbling
G48 0280  3    line.
G48 0280  4       While the final combat of the campaign was being
G48 0290  4    worked out at Jonesborough, Thomas, on Sherman's instructions,
G48 0300  2    ordered Slocum, now commanding the Twentieth Corps,
G48 0310  1    to make an effort to occupy Atlanta if he could do
G48 0310 12    so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack.
G48 0320  6    The dispatch must have been sent after sundown on September
G48 0330  5    1. Slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning,
G48 0340  3    found the town empty, accepted the surrender of the
G48 0340 12    mayor and occupied the city a little before noon.
G48 0350  9       On the morning of September 2 the Fourth Corps and
G48 0360  8    the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio followed the
G48 0370  5    line of Hardee's retreat. About noon they came up with
G48 0380  4    the enemy two miles from Lovejoy's Station and deployed.
G48 0390  1    The Fourth Corps assaulted and carried a small portion
G48 0390 10    of the enemy works but could not hold possession of
G48 0400  9    the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of
G48 0410  5    the line. That night a note written in Slocum's hand
G48 0420  3    and dated from inside the captured city came to Sherman
G48 0430  1    stating that the Twentieth Corps was in possession
G48 0430  9    of Atlanta. Before making the news public Sherman sent
G48 0440  8    an officer with the note to Thomas. In a short time
G48 0450  7    the officer returned and Thomas followed on his heels.
G48 0460  4    The cautious Thomas re-examined the note and then,
G48 0460 13    making up his mind that it was genuine, snapped his
G48 0470 10    fingers, whistled and almost danced in his exuberance.
G48 0480  6       The next day Sherman issued his orders ending the
G48 0490  5    campaign and pulled his armies back to Atlanta. The
G48 0500  2    measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign
G48 0500 10    is a matter of personal choice. Sherman laid great
G48 0510  7    store by place captures. Hood refused to notice anything
G48 0520  6    except captured guns and colors. By both standards
G48 0530  3    Thomas had the right to be proud.
G48 0530 10       Thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose,
G48 0540  8    unmurmuring endurance, cheerful obedience, brilliant
G48 0550  3    heroism and high qualities in battle.
G48 0560  1       Sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was
G48 0560 10    skillful and well executed but that the slowness of
G48 0570  7    a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits
G48 0580  3    of victory. He supposed the military world would approve
G48 0590  1    of his accomplishment.
G48 0590  4       Whatever the military world thought, the political
G48 0600  3    world approved it wholeheartedly. For some time, despondency
G48 0610  1    in some Northern quarters had been displayed in two
G48 0610 10    ways- an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction
G48 0620  7    with Lincoln. Proposals were in the air for a year's
G48 0630  8    armistice. Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected.
G48 0640  5    In the midst of this gloom, at 10:05 P.M. on September
G48 0650  3    2, Slocum's telegram to Stanton, "General Sherman has
G48 0660  2    taken Atlanta", shattered the talk of a negotiated
G48 0660 10    peace and boosted Lincoln into the White House. To
G48 0670  9    the Republicans no victory could have been more complete.
G48 0680  6       Official congratulations showered upon Sherman and
G48 0690  5    his army. Lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability,
G48 0700  2    courage and perseverance. He felt that this campaign
G48 0700 10    would be famous in the annals of war. Grant called
G48 0710 10    it prompt, skillful and brilliant. Halleck described
G48 0720  5    it as the most brilliant of the war.
G48 0730  1       Actually the Atlanta campaign was a military failure.
G48 0730  9    Next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of
G48 0740 11    its freedom of action. Sherman had accomplished this
G48 0750  5    much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it
G48 0760  3    by his thirty-mile retreat from Lovejoy's to Atlanta.
G48 0770  1    But, so far as its territorial objectives were concerned,
G48 0770 10    the campaign was successful. Within the narrow frame
G48 0780  7    of military tactics, too, the experts agree that the
G48 0790  6    campaign was brilliant. In seventeen weeks the military
G48 0800  3    front was driven southward more than 100 miles. There
G48 0810  1    was a battle on an average of once every three weeks.
G48 0810 12    The skirmishing was almost constant. In the summary
G48 0820  7    of the principal events of the campaign compiled from
G48 0830  3    the official records there are only ten days which
G48 0840  1    show no fighting. The casualties in the Army of the
G48 0840 11    Cumberland were 22,807, while for all three armies
G48 0850  7    they were 37,081. Men were killed in their camps, at
G48 0860  5    their meals and in their sleep. Rifle fire often kept
G48 0870  2    the opposing gunners from manning their pieces. Modern
G48 0870 10    warfare was born in this campaign- periscopes, camouflage,
G48 0880  8    booby traps, land mines, extended order, trench raids,
G48 0890  6    foxholes, armored cars, night attacks, flares, sharpshooters
G48 0900  4    in trees, interlaced vines and treetops, which were
G48 0910  3    the forerunners of barbed wire, trip wires to thwart
G48 0910 12    a cavalry charge, which presaged the mine trap, and
G48 0920  8    the general use of anesthetics. The use of map coordinates
G48 0930  6    was begun when the senior officers began to select
G48 0940  4    tactical points by designating a spot as "near the
G48 0950  1    letter o in the word mountain". A few weeks later
G48 0950 11    the maps were being divided into squares and a position
G48 0960  8    was described as being "about lots 239, 247 and 272
G48 0970  6    with pickets forward as far as 196". This system was
G48 0980  3    dependent upon identical maps and Thomas supplied them
G48 0985  1    from a mobile lithograph press. Orders of the day began
G48 0990  6    to specify the standard map for the movement.
G48 1000  6       Sherman proved that a railway base could be movable
G48 1010  5    and the most brilliant feature of the Atlanta campaign
G48 1020  2    was the rapid repair of the tracks. To the Rebels it
G48 1020 13    seemed as if Sherman carried tunnels and bridges in
G48 1030  9    his pockets. The whistle of Sherman's locomotives often
G48 1040  5    drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire. As always,
G48 1050  4    the ranks worked out new and better tactics, but there
G48 1060  2    was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted
G48 1060 11    these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated
G48 1070  9    them into their military thinking. The fossilized,
G48 1080  5    formalized, precedent-based thinking of the legendary
G48 1090  4    military brain was not evident in Sherman's armies.
G48 1100  1    Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long
G48 1100 10    with the old.
G48 1110  1       One of Sherman's most serious shortcomings, however,
G48 1110  8    was his mistrust of his cavalry. He never saw that
G48 1120 10    it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute
G48 1130  7    for it. Then, in some way, this lack of faith in the
G48 1140  5    cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging
G48 1150  1    effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice.
G48 1150 11    A horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the
G48 1160 10    infantryman got along with two pounds. The horseman
G48 1170  5    required eleven times more than the footman. So Sherman
G48 1180  3    tried a compromise. He would ship by rail five pounds
G48 1180 13    per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that
G48 1190 10    were needed could be picked up off the country. It
G48 1200  8    failed to work. Already debilitated by the Chattanooga
G48 1210  4    starvation, the quality of Sherman's horseflesh ran
G48 1220  2    downhill as the campaign progressed. Every recorded
G48 1220  9    request by Thomas for a delay in a flank movement or
G48 1230 10    an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses.
G48 1240  4       Well led, properly organized cavalry, in its complementary
G48 1250  4    role to infantry, had four functions. First, it could
G48 1260  3    locate the enemy infantry, learn what they were doing,
G48 1260 12    and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come
G48 1270  9    up and take over. Second, it could screen its own infantry
G48 1280  7    from the sight of the enemy. Third, it could threaten
G48 1290  4    at all times, and destroy when possible, the enemy
G48 1300  1    communications. It could reach key tactical points
G48 1300  8    faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them
G48 1310  7    as the case might be for the foot soldier. Its climactic
G48 1320  4    role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy
G48 1330  2    but this chance never came in the Atlanta campaign.
G48 1330 11    Thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the
G48 1340  9    test it was to meet, but his plans were wrecked when
G48 1350  5    it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility
G48 1360  2    and with its commander stripped from it.
G48 1360  9       Sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as Thomas
G48 1370  9    but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead
G48 1380  5    of cavalry wings. His conception proved workable but
G48 1390  3    slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean, deft,
G48 1390 13    well organized retreats with small materiel losses.
G48 1400  7    Sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully
G48 1410  5    break up hostile railways, yet Garrard's Covington
G48 1420  2    raid and Rousseau's Opelika raid cut two-thirds of
G48 1430  2    the rail lines he had to break and Sherman lived in
G48 1430 13    mortal fear of what Forrest might do to his communications.
G48 1440  8       When McPherson pushed blindly through Snake Creek
G48 1450  6    Gap in a potentially decisive movement, the only cavalry
G48 1460  5    in his van was the Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry,
G48 1470  2    totally inadequate for its role. It stumbled on infantry
G48 1480  1    where no infantry should have been and McPherson's
G48 1480  9    aggressive impulse faded out, overwhelmed by fears
G48 1490  6    of the unknown. A proper cavalry command in his front
G48 1500  5    would have developed the fact that he had run into
G48 1510  1    one division of Polk's Army of the Mississippi moving
G48 1510 10    up from the direction of Mobile to join Johnston at
G48 1520  9    Dalton. From the night of August 30 to the morning
G48 1530  7    of September 2 there was no Union cavalry east of the
G48 1540  4    Macon railway to disclose to Sherman that he was missing
G48 1550  1    the greatest opportunity of his career. A great part
G48 1550 10    of the time, Thomas' infantry never knew the location
G48 1560  7    of the enemy line. At such times Thomas wondered when
G48 1570  5    and where a counterattack would strike him. It was
G48 1580  4    the hard way to fight a war but Thomas did it without
G48 1580 16    making any disastrous mistakes.
G48 1590  4       Heat during the Atlanta campaign, coupled with unsuitable
G48 1600  4    clothing, caused individual irritation that was compounded
G48 1610  3    by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean
G48 1620  1    clothing. To relieve the itch and sweat galls, the
G48 1620 10    men got into the water whenever they could and since
G48 1630  7    each sizable stream was generally the dividing line
G48 1640  4    between the armies the pickets declared a private truce
G48 1650  2    while the men went swimming. Johnston believed that
G48 1650 10    Sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties
G48 1660  8    to locate the various fords. Lieutenant Colonel James
G48 1670  5    P. Brownlow, who commanded the First Brigade of Thomas'
G48 1680  5    First Cavalry Division, was ordered across one of these
G48 1690  4    fords. The water was deep and Brownlow took his troopers
G48 1700  1    across naked- except for guns, cartridge boxes and
G48 1700  9    hats. They kicked their horses through the deep water
G48 1710  8    with their bare heels, drove the Rebels out of their
G48 1730  6    rifle pits and captured four men. Most of the Rebels
G48 1740  3    got away since they could make better time through
G48 1740 12    the stiff brush than their naked pursuers.
G48 1750  6       Rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three
G48 1760  5    of Sherman's armies. Merited recommendations from army
G48 1770  3    commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees
G48 1780  1    from civil life.
