P01 0010  1       They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man. To
P01 0010 10    them he could have been the broken bell in the church
P01 0020  9    tower which rang before and after Mass, and at noon,
P01 0030  6    and at six each evening- its tone, repetitive, monotonous,
P01 0040  2    never breaking the boredom of the streets. The Old
P01 0050  1    Man was unimportant.
P01 0050  4       Yet if he were not there, they would have missed
P01 0060  2    him, as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing
P01 0060 13    against the screen door in early June; or the smell
P01 0070 10    of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both
P01 0080  9    sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped
P01 0090  4    in fly-dotted cheesecloth. Or the surging whirling
P01 0100  1    sounds of bats at night, when their black bodies dived
P01 0100 11    into the blackness above and below the amber street
P01 0110  7    lights. Or the bay of female dogs in heat.
P01 0120  4       They never called him by name, although he had one.
P01 0130  2    Filippo Rossi, that's what he was called in the old
P01 0130 12    country; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man.
P01 0140 11    But this was not unusual, because youth in these quarters
P01 0150  8    was always pushed at a distance from its elders. Youth
P01 0160  5    obeyed when commanded. It went to church on Sunday
P01 0170  3    and one Saturday a month went to confession. But youth
P01 0180  1    asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand
P01 0180 12    or a kiss given in passing.
P01 0190  3       The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long
P01 0200  2    since happened. But the past was dead here as the present
P01 0200 13    was dead. Once the Old Man had had a wife. And once
P01 0210 11    she, too, ignored him. With a tiny fur-piece wrapped
P01 0220  7    around her shoulders, she wiggled her satin-covered
P01 0230  3    buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop.
P01 0240  1    In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and
P01 0240 11    in the other a straw suitcase. The way she strutted
P01 0250  6    down the street, the Old Man would have been blind
P01 0260  4    not to have noticed both. Without looking at him, without
P01 0270  2    looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in
P01 0270 10    front of her, she climbed up into one of those orange
P01 0280 10    streetcars, rode away in it, and never came back.
P01 0290  6       "But she shouldn't have come here in the first place",
P01 0300  5    the women had said.
P01 0300  9       "No, no. Not that one. She thought she was bigger
P01 0310  8    than we are because she came from Torino".
P01 0320  2       "Eh, Torino! She gave herself fancy airs! Just because
P01 0330  3    she had a part on the stage in the old country, she
P01 0330 15    thought she could carry her head higher than ours".
P01 0340  9    They had slapped their thighs.
P01 0350  3       "It's not for making pretty speeches about Dante
P01 0360  1    those actresses get paid so good".
P01 0360  7       "Henh"! Calloused fingers, caressed only by the
P01 0370  6    smoothness of polished rosaries, had swayed excitedly
P01 0380  3    beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted,
P01 0390  1    never to be tweezed away. Mauve-colored mouths that
P01 0390 10    had never known anything sweeter than the taste of
P01 0400  7    new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled,
P01 0410  5    but had condemned again and again. "Puttana"!
P01 0420  1       But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now,
P01 0430  2    nobody cared a fig. It was enough for people to know
P01 0430 13    that at one time he had looked down the street at the
P01 0440 11    fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching
P01 0450  5    her become thinner and thinner in the distance, as
P01 0460  3    thin as the seams on her stockings, and still thinner.
P01 0460 13    His voice had not commanded her to stop. It had not
P01 0470 11    questioned why. The women said they had seen him wave
P01 0480  8    an exhausted farewell; but he might have been shooing
P01 0490  5    away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto
P01 0500  2    him. (He was never without that dog.) And his eyes-
P01 0500 12    those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had
P01 0510  6    not altered their expression or direction. The Old
P01 0520  5    Man's very soul could have left him and flown down
P01 0530  3    that street, but he wouldn't have had anyone know it.
P01 0530 13       Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar
P01 0540 10    bill had come from and where it was taking his wife.
P01 0550  9    But when he called for his withered, wrinkled sister
P01 0560  4    Rose to care for him and the children, had he guessed
P01 0570  3    that all he would remember of his woman was the memory
P01 0570 14    of her climbing into that streetcar?
P01 0580  6       There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the
P01 0590  4    way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street
P01 0600  2    and his back in opposition to the church behind him.
P01 0600 12    For all he saw or cared to see, this could have been
P01 0610 11    a town in Italy, not the outskirts of Philadelphia.
P01 0620  4    It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled.
P01 0630  5    What did it matter to him that the park at the foot
P01 0640  1    of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that
P01 0640  9    roared from the stucco station into the city's center
P01 0650  7    at half-hour intervals? Or that the tiny creek spun
P01 0660  6    its silent course toward the Schuylkill? This place
P01 0670  3    was hatred to him, just as hatred was his only companion
P01 0680  1    in his aloneness. To him they were one and the same.
P01 0680 12       Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall
P01 0690 11    of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the
P01 0700  5    city. Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses
P01 0710  2    the color of ash. It slashed the sloping manure-scented
P01 0720  1    lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white
P01 0720 10    wooden porches. It swayed with the wicker swings and
P01 0730  8    screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors.
P01 0740  4       Even the stable-garage, which housed nothing now
P01 0750  2    but the scent of rot, had a lawn before it. And the
P01 0750 14    coffee shop on Drexel Street, where the men spent their
P01 0760  9    evenings and Sundays playing cards, had a rose hedge
P01 0770  7    beneath its window. The hedge reeked of coffee dregs
P01 0780  4    thrown against it.
P01 0780  7       Only one house on the street had no lawn before
P01 0790  5    it. It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with
P01 0800  2    a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade. That
P01 0800 11    was Bartoli's shop. Above it, from a second-story showroom,
P01 0810  9    wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood. Did the Old
P01 0820  6    Man remember them there?
P01 0830  1       Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood
P01 0830  9    in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the
P01 0840  8    slant of the hill, rising with the hill to the top
P01 0850  6    where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery.
P01 0860  1    Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of
P01 0860  9    those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy
P01 0870  7    behind the houses where backyards owned no fences,
P01 0880  4    where one man's property blended with the next to form
P01 0890  3    courtyards in which no one knew privacy. Love and hatred
P01 0890 13    and fear were one here, shaded only by fig trees and
P01 0900 11    grape vines. And the forked tongue of gossip licked
P01 0910  6    its sinister way from back porch to back porch.
P01 0920  3       The Old Man silently fed upon these streets. They
P01 0930  1    kept him alive, waiting. Waiting for what and for whom,
P01 0930 11    only he could tell and would not. It was as though
P01 0940  9    he had made a pact with the devil himself, but it was
P01 0950  6    not yet time to pay the price. He was holding out for
P01 0960  3    something. He was determined to hold out.
P01 0960 10    #2#
P01 0960 11    The Old Man's son threw himself down, belly first,
P01 0970  8    upon a concrete step, taking in the coolness of it,
P01 0980  7    and dreaming of the day he would be rich. At fifteen
P01 0990  3    he didn't care that he had no mother, that he couldn't
P01 1000  1    remember her face or her touch; neither did he care
P01 1000 11    that Aunt Rose provided for him.
P01 1010  4       He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage,
P01 1020  2    and he couldn't have cared less about that either.
P01 1020 11    To him life was a restless boredom that began with
P01 1030  9    the rising sun and ended only with sleep.
P01 1040  4       When he would be a man, he would be a rich man.
P01 1050  2    He would not be like the "rich Americans" who lived
P01 1050 12    in white-columned houses on the other side of the park.
P01 1060  9    He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city
P01 1070  7    each morning. He would not carry a brief case. Nor
P01 1080  3    would he work at all. He would square his shoulders
P01 1080 13    and carry a cane before each step. He would sit inside
P01 1090 11    the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table
P01 1100  9    and a girl would hear him and come running, bowing
P01 1110  4    with her running, calling out in her bowing, "At your
P01 1120  2    service". He would order her to bring coffee, and would
P01 1120 12    take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he
P01 1130 11    would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light
P01 1140  7    and smoke. He could do that when he would be a man.
P01 1150  6       "Hey, Laura"! he called to his sister on the porch
P01 1160  4    above the steps. She was only ten months older than
P01 1170  1    he. "Laura, what would you say if I smoked a pipe"?
P01 1170 12       Laura did not answer him. She leaned unconcerned
P01 1180  8    against the broken porch fence, brushing and drying
P01 1190  5    her wet, gilded hair in the sun. One lithe leg straddled
P01 1200  3    the railing and swung loosely before the creaking,
P01 1210  1    torn pales. Her tanned foot, whose arch swept high
P01 1210 10    and white, pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes
P01 1220  6    like fingers, whose tips glowed white. All the while
P01 1240  5    she sat there, her sinewy arms swirled before her chest.
P01 1250  2       Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii.
P01 1250 11    It was a face that had lost its childlike softness
P01 1260 10    and was beginning to fold within its fragile features
P01 1270  6    a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours.
P01 1280  4    The eyes, blue and always somewhat downcast, possessed
P01 1290  1    a sullen quality. Even though the boy could not see
P01 1290 11    them, he knew they were clouded by distance. He was
P01 1300  8    never sure they fully took him in.
P01 1310  3       Pompeii called again, "Laura"! But the only answer
P01 1320  1    that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail
P01 1320 11    from her leg moving against it.
P01 1330  4       "She's in a mood", he thought "There's not a month
P01 1340  4    she doesn't get herself in a mood".
P01 1340 11       Well, what did that matter when the sun was shining
P01 1350 10    and there were dreams to dream about? And as for his
P01 1360  8    pipe, if he wanted to smoke one, nobody would stop
P01 1370  4    him. Not even Laura.
P01 1370  8       Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by
P01 1380  5    a warm wetness lapping against his chin, and his eyes
P01 1390  4    opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret
P01 1390 15    tongue, feasting against the salt taste of him. Above
P01 1400  9    the tongue, an aged yellow eye, sallow and time-cast,
P01 1410  7    encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin,
P01 1420  3    stared unfalteringly at him.
P01 1420  7       "Christ sake, goat, git"! But the goat would not.
P01 1430  8       "You're boiling milk, ain't you"? soothing it with
P01 1440  7    his hand, knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen
P01 1450  5    smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his
P01 1460  3    touch. Pompeii rolled over. His head undulated gradually,
P01 1460 11    covering space, to come straining beneath the taut
P01 1470  8    belly within the warmth of those teats. With his mouth
P01 1480  7    opened wide, he squirted the warm white milk against
P01 1490  4    the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light,
P01 1500  1    earthy taste of it. The boy's fingers and mouth operated
P01 1500 11    with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player, pressing
P01 1510  9    and pulling, delighting in what he did.
P01 1520  5       Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud.
P01 1530  2    Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane.
P01 1530 12    But the boy could see only the goat's belly.
P01 1540  8       The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass
P01 1550  6    over him, sensing something portentous in it. He knew
P01 1560  4    it was there, knew also what it was about, but he wouldn't
P01 1570  1    raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back.
P01 1570 11    There would be time enough, perhaps the Old Man reassured
P01 1580  9    himself, to pay the devil his due. Time enough to give
P01 1590  8    up his soul.
P01 1590 11       In the meantime, six sandals, stained an ocher,
P01 1600  6    the same color as Pompeii's shaved hair, edged up close
P01 1610  5    to him. The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted
P01 1620  2    him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew, so that he quickly
P01 1630  1    released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining
P01 1630 12    its haunches for ticks.
P01 1640  3       He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged
P01 1650  2    to Niobe, the neatest ones to Concetta, and the laced
P01 1650 12    ones to Romeo, Concetta's idiot brother. Pompeii expected
P01 1660  8    Romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the
P01 1670 10    ground. He expected Concetta's thin hand to reach down
P01 1680  6    to grasp the boy, and her shrill, impetuous voice to
P01 1690  3    sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh
P01 1690 11    that was never sure of hearing anything.
