K11 0010  1    Standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital
K11 0010 11    tent on which the rain now dripped, no longer drumming-
K11 0020 10    Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the
K11 0030  8    improvised counter of boards laid across two beef barrels.
K11 0040  5    There was, of course, no real need to rearrange everything.
K11 0050  2    A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake, or
K11 0060  1    the toffee, or the barley sugar, or the sardines, or
K11 0060 11    the bitters, or the condensed milk, or the stationery,
K11 0070  7    or the needles- what could it mean? Adam watched his
K11 0080  5    own hands make the caressing, anxious movement that,
K11 0090  2    when rain falls and nobody comes, and ruin draws close
K11 0090 12    like a cat rubbing against the ankles, has been the
K11 0100 10    ritual of stall vendors, forever.
K11 0110  3       He recognized the gesture. He knew its meaning.
K11 0120  1    He had seen a dry, old, yellowing hand reach out, with
K11 0120 12    that painful solicitude, to touch, to rearrange, to
K11 0130  7    shift aimlessly, some object worth a pfennig. Back
K11 0140  5    in Bavaria he had seen that gesture, and at that sight
K11 0150  3    his heart had always died within him. On such occasions
K11 0150 13    he had not had the courage to look at the face above
K11 0160 12    the hand, whatever face it might be.
K11 0170  5       Now the face was his own. He wondered what expression,
K11 0180  2    as he made that gesture, was on his face. He wondered
K11 0180 13    if it wore the old anxiety, or the old, taut stoicism.
K11 0190 11    But there was no need, he remembered, for his hand
K11 0200  7    to reach out, for his face to show concern or stoicism.
K11 0210  4    It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came.
K11 0220  1    Then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and
K11 0220 11    the suffering? What was he expiating? Or was he now
K11 0230  9    taking the role- the gesture and the suffering- because
K11 0240  5    it was the only way to affirm his history and identity
K11 0250  4    in the torpid, befogged loneliness of this land.
K11 0260  1       This was Virginia.
K11 0260  4       He looked out of the tent at the company street.
K11 0270  3    The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street.
K11 0280  1    Beyond that misty gray of the rain, he saw the stretching
K11 0280 12    hutment, low diminutive log cabins, chinked with mud,
K11 0290  8    with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through,
K11 0300  7    with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from
K11 0310  4    hardtack boxes, or fence rails, with cranky chimneys
K11 0320  1    of sticks and dried mud. The chimney of the hut across
K11 0320 12    from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends
K11 0330  8    knocked out. In this heavy air, however, that device
K11 0340  4    did not seem to help. The smoke from that chimney rose
K11 0350  2    as sluggishly as smoke from any other, and hung as
K11 0350 12    sadly in the drizzle, creeping back down along the
K11 0360  7    sopping canvas of the roof.
K11 0370  1       Over the door was a board with large, inept lettering:
K11 0370 11    HOME SWEET HOME. This was the hut of Simms Purdew,
K11 0380 10    the hero.
K11 0390  1       The men were huddled in those lairs. Adam knew the
K11 0390 11    names of some. He knew the faces of all, hairy or shaven,
K11 0400  9    old or young, fat or thin, suffering or hardened, sad
K11 0410  4    or gay, good or bad. When they stood about his tent,
K11 0420  3    chaffing each other, exchanging their obscenities,
K11 0420  9    cursing command or weather, he had studied their faces.
K11 0430  8    He had had the need to understand what life lurked
K11 0440  5    behind the mask of flesh, behind the oath, the banter,
K11 0450  3    the sadness. Once covertly looking at Simms Purdew,
K11 0450 11    the only man in the world whom he hated, he had seen
K11 0460 12    the heavy, slack, bestubbled jaw open and close to
K11 0470  7    emit the cruel, obscene banter, and had seen the pale-blue
K11 0480  5    eyes go watery with whisky and merriment, and suddenly
K11 0490  1    he was not seeing the face of that vile creature. He
K11 0490 12    was seeing, somehow, the face of a young boy, the boy
K11 0500 10    Simms Purdew must once have been, a boy with sorrel
K11 0510  7    hair, and blue eyes dancing with gaiety, and the boy
K11 0520  4    mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles.
K11 0520 10       In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within
K11 0530  9    himself saying: I must not hate him, I must not hate
K11 0540  9    him or I shall die.
K11 0550  1       His heart suddenly opened to joy.
K11 0550  6       He thought that if once, only once, he could talk
K11 0560  5    with Simms Purdew, something about his own life, and
K11 0570  2    all life, would be clear and simple. If Simms Purdew
K11 0570 12    would turn to him and say: "Adam, you know when I was
K11 0580 11    a boy, it was a funny thing happened. Lemme tell you
K11 0590  6    now"-
K11 0590  7       If only Simms Purdew could do that, whatever the
K11 0600  7    thing he remembered and told. It would be a sign for
K11 0610  6    the untellable, and he, Adam, would understand.
K11 0620  1       Now, Adam, in the gray light of afternoon, stared
K11 0620 10    across at the hut opposite his tent, and thought of
K11 0630  8    Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom, snoring on
K11 0640  6    his bunk, with the fumes of whisky choking the air.
K11 0650  2    He saw the sign above the door of the hut: HOME SWEET
K11 0650 14    HOME. He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming
K11 0660 12    up the company street, with an armful of wood.
K11 0670  6       It was Pullen James, the campmate of Simms Purdew.
K11 0680  4    He carried the wood, carried the water, did the cooking,
K11 0690  2    cleaning and mending, and occasionally got a kick in
K11 0690 11    the butt for his pains. Adam watched the moisture flow
K11 0700  9    from the poncho. It gave the rubberized fabric a dull
K11 0710  7    gleam, like metal. Pullen James humbly lowered his
K11 0720  3    head, pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut,
K11 0730  1    and was gone from sight.
K11 0730  6       Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms
K11 0740  3    Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry
K11 0750  1    at Antietam.
K11 0750  3       The street was again empty. The drizzle was slacking
K11 0760  2    off now, but the light was grayer. With enormous interest,
K11 0770  1    Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted
K11 0770 10    the objects on the board directly before him. Into
K11 0780  6    the emptiness of the street, and his spirit, moved
K11 0790  3    a form.
K11 0790  5       The form was swathed in an army blanket, much patched,
K11 0800  3    fastened at the neck with a cord. From under the shapeless
K11 0810  1    huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud. The feet
K11 0810 12    wore army shoes, in obvious disrepair. The head was
K11 0820  8    wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a
K11 0830  7    great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been
K11 0840  3    flung. The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle.
K11 0850  1    Moisture ran down the cheeks, gathered at the tip of
K11 0850 11    the nose, and at the chin. The figure was close enough
K11 0860  8    now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the
K11 0870  4    drop clinging there. The figure stopped and one hand
K11 0880  2    was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the
K11 0880 11    nose. Then the figure moved on.
K11 0890  5       This was one of the Irish women who had built their
K11 0900  3    own huts down near the river. They did washing. Adam
K11 0900 13    recognized this one. He recognized her because she
K11 0910  8    was the one who, in a winter twilight, on the edge
K11 0920  7    of camp, had once stopped him and reached down her
K11 0930  3    hand to touch his fly. "Slice o' mutton, bhoy"? she
K11 0940  2    had queried in her soft guttural. "Slice o' mutton"?
K11 0950  1       Her name was Mollie. They called her Mollie the
K11 0950 10    Mutton, and laughed. Looking down the street after
K11 0960  6    her, Adam saw that she had again stopped and again
K11 0970  4    removed one hand from the basket. He could not make
K11 0980  1    out, but he knew that again she was scratching her
K11 0980 11    nose. Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose.
K11 0990  6       The words ran crazily in his head: Mollie the Mutton
K11 1000  5    is scratching her nose in the rain.
K11 1010  1       Then the words fell into a pattern: "Mollie the
K11 1010 10    Mutton is scratching her nose, Scratching her nose
K11 1020  8    in the rain. Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose
K11 1030  6    in the rain".
K11 1040  1       The pattern would not stop. It came again and again.
K11 1050  4    He felt trapped in that pattern, in the repetition.
K11 1060  1       Suddenly he thought he might weep. "What's the matter
K11 1060 10    with me"? he demanded out loud. He looked wildly around,
K11 1070 10    at the now empty street, at the mud, at the rain. "Oh,
K11 1080 10    what's the matter with me"? he demanded.
K11 1090  4    ##
K11 1090  5    When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest,
K11 1100  3    locked the two big hasps and secured the additional
K11 1100 12    chain, tied the fly of the tent, and picked up the
K11 1110 11    cash box, he moved up the darkening street. He would
K11 1120  6    consign the cash box into the hands of Jed Hawksworth,
K11 1130  3    then stand by while his employer checked the contents
K11 1140  1    and the list of items sold. Then he-
K11 1140  9       Then what? He did not know. His mind closed on that
K11 1150  8    prospect, as though fog had descended to blot out a
K11 1160  5    valley.
K11 1160  6       Far off, in the dusk, he heard voices singing, muffled
K11 1170  3    but strong. In one of the huts a group of men were
K11 1180  1    huddled together, singing. He stopped. He strained
K11 1180  8    to hear. He heard the words: "Rock of Ages, cleft for
K11 1190  8    me, Let me hide myself in Thee! Let the water and the
K11 1200 10    blood From Thy riven side ..."
K11 1210  3       He thought: I am a Jew from Bavaria.
K11 1220  2       He was standing there, he thought, in Virginia,
K11 1230  1    in the thickening dusk, in a costly greatcoat that
K11 1230 10    had belonged to another Jew. That other Jew, a young
K11 1240  7    man too, had left that greatcoat behind, in a rich
K11 1250  5    house, and marched away. He had crossed the river which
K11 1260  1    now, beyond the woods yonder, was sliding darkly under
K11 1260 10    the mist. He had plunged into the dark woods beyond.
K11 1270  9    He had died there.
K11 1280  1       What had that man, that other young Jew, felt as
K11 1280 10    he stood in the twilight and heard other men, far away,
K11 1290  7    singing together?.
K11 1290  9       Adam thought of the hutments, regiment after regiment,
K11 1300  8    row after row, the thousands of huts, stretching away
K11 1310  6    into the night. He thought of the men, the nameless
K11 1320  4    thousands, huddling in them. He thought of Simms Purdew
K11 1330  2    snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by
K11 1330 11    the hearth, skirmishing an undershirt for lice, and
K11 1340  7    a wet log sizzled. He thought of Simms Purdew, who
K11 1350  5    once had risen at the edge of a cornfield, a maniacal
K11 1370  2    scream on his lips, and swung a clubbed musket like
K11 1370 12    a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about
K11 1380 10    him.
K11 1380 11       He thought of Simms Purdew rising up, fearless in
K11 1390  8    glory. He felt the sweetness of pity flood through
K11 1400  5    him, veining his very flesh. Those men, lying in the
K11 1410  3    huts, they did not know. They did not know who they
K11 1410 14    were or know their own worth. In the pity for them
K11 1420 10    his loneliness was gone.
K11 1430  1       Then he thought of Aaron Blaustein standing in his
K11 1430 10    rich house saying: "God is tired of taking the blame.
K11 1440  9    He is going to let History take the blame for a while".
K11 1450  8       He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter
K11 1460  6    of the great chandelier.
K11 1460 10       He thought: Only in my heart can I make the world
K11 1470 10    hang together.
K11 1480  1    ##
K11 1480  1    Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut.
K11 1480 11    He saw Mose squatting by the hearth, breaking up hardtack
K11 1490  8    into a pan. A pot was boiling on the coals. "Done give
K11 1500  7    Ole Buckra all his money"? Mose asked softly.
K11 1510  4       Adam nodded.
K11 1510  6       "Yeah", Mose murmured, "yeah. And look what he done
K11 1520  7    give us".
K11 1520  9       Adam looked at the pot. "What is it"? he asked.
K11 1530  9       "Chicken", Mose said, and theatrically licked his
K11 1540  6    lips. "Gre't big fat chicken, yeah". He licked his
K11 1550  5    lips again.
K11 1550  7       Then: "Yeah. A chicken with six tits and a tail
K11 1560  7    lak a corkscrew. And hit squealed for slop". Mose giggled.
K11 1570  4    "Fooled you, huh? It is the same ole same, tell me
K11 1580  3    hit's name. It is sowbelly with tits on. It is salt
K11 1580 14    po'k. It is salt po'k and skippers. That po'k, it was
K11 1590 11    so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come
K11 1600 10    when you say, 'Hoo-pig'. Had to put my foot on it to
K11 1610  9    hole it down while I cut it up fer the lob-scuse".
K11 1620  4       He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the
K11 1630  2    boiling pot of lobscouse. "Good ole lob-scuse", he
K11 1630 11    mumbled, and stirred the pot. He stopped stirring and
K11 1640  9    looked over his shoulder. "Know what Ole Buckra et
K11 1650  6    tonight"? he demanded. "Know what I had to fix fer
K11 1660  6    Ole Him"?
K11 1660  8       Adam shook his head.
K11 1670  1       "Chicken", Mose said.
