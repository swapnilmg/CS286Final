G16 0010  1    The "reality" to which they respond is rationally empty
G16 0010 10    and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness
G16 0020  9    of this unknown and empty world. Their artistic rationale
G16 0030  6    is given to the witness of unreason.
G16 0040  1       These polar concerns (imitation vs. formalism) reflect
G16 0050  1    a philosophical and religious situation which has been
G16 0050  9    developing over a long period of time. The breakdown
G16 0060  9    of classical structures of meaning in all realms of
G16 0070  6    western culture has given rise to several generations
G16 0080  1    of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.
G16 0090  1    Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation
G16 0090 10    in personal and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification
G16 0100  7    in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers. The image
G16 0110  6    of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference
G16 0120  4    of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming
G16 0130  3    mystery. The image of God has simply disappeared. All
G16 0140  2    such imitations of negative quality have given rise
G16 0140 10    to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic
G16 0150  8    and highly individualistic humanism: if man can neither
G16 0160  5    know nor love reality as it is, he can at least invent
G16 0170  3    an artistic "reality" which is its own world and which
G16 0180  1    can speak to man of purely personal and subjective
G16 0180 10    qualities capable of being known and worthy of being
G16 0190  8    loved. The person of the artist becomes a final bastion
G16 0200  5    of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march
G16 0210  3    of events and the decay of classical religious and
G16 0210 12    philosophical systems.
G16 0220  2       Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and
G16 0230  1    whatever the tension between these two approaches to
G16 0230  9    understanding the artistic imagination, it will be
G16 0240  7    readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive,
G16 0250  2    that they belong together. Without the decay of a sense
G16 0260  2    of objective reference (except as the imitation of
G16 0260 10    mystery), the stress on subjective invention would
G16 0270  6    never have been stimulated into being. And although
G16 0280  4    these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves
G16 0290  1    insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art,
G16 0290  8    their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires
G16 0300  8    that they be taken seriously and gives promise that
G16 0310  5    from their very substance, new and valid chapters in
G16 0320  3    the philosophy of art may be written. For better or
G16 0320 13    worse we cannot regard "imitation" in the arts in the
G16 0330 10    simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism.
G16 0340  6    A broader concept of imitation is needed, one which
G16 0350  5    acknowledges that true invention is important, that
G16 0360  2    the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic
G16 0370  1    causal factors out of which it arises. On the other
G16 0370 11    hand, we cannot regard artistic invention as pure,
G16 0380  5    uncaused, and unrelated to the times in which it occurs.
G16 0390  5    We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the
G16 0400  2    solipsism and futility of pure formalism. Accordingly,
G16 0400  9    it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory
G16 0410 10    of imitation (which I shall call mimesis in order to
G16 0420  6    distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation)
G16 0430  2    and a new theory of invention (which I shall call symbol
G16 0440  1    for reasons to be stated hereafter).
G16 0440  7    #THE MIMETIC IMAGINATION IN THE ARTS#
G16 0450  3    The word "mimesis" ("imitation") is usually associated
G16 0460  1    with Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, "imitation" is
G16 0460  9    twice removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical
G16 0470 10    appearance, which in itself is a poor copy of ideal
G16 0480  9    essence. All artistic and mythological representations,
G16 0490  2    therefore, are "imitations of imitations" and are completely
G16 0500  3    superseded by the truth value of "dialectic", the proper
G16 0510  2    use of the inquiring intellect. In Plato's judgment,
G16 0510 10    the arts play a meaningful role in society only in
G16 0520 10    the education of the young, prior to the full development
G16 0530  6    of their intellectual powers. Presupposed in Plato's
G16 0540  3    system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which
G16 0550  1    a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable
G16 0550 10    of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom. Aristotle
G16 0560  7    also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature
G16 0570  5    and activity into levels of excellence and, like Plato,
G16 0580  3    he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the
G16 0580 12    top level. The Poetics, in affirming that all human
G16 0590  8    arts are "modes of imitation", gives a more serious
G16 0600  7    role to artistic mimesis than did Plato. But Aristotle
G16 0610  5    kept the principle of levels and even augmented it
G16 0620  2    by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character
G16 0620 11    and action must be imitated if the play is to be a
G16 0630 12    vehicle of serious and important human truths. For
G16 0640  5    both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, in contrast
G16 0650  3    to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable
G16 0650 11    of expressing the character of fundamental reality.
G16 0660  7       The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive
G16 0670  6    volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from
G16 0680  7    a classic theory of imitation (based upon a recognition
G16 0690  3    of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation
G16 0700  1    in which the levels are dissolved. Following the theme
G16 0700 10    of Incarnation in the Gospels, the Christian artist
G16 0710  7    and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary
G16 0720  4    events "figures" of divine power and reality. Here
G16 0730  2    artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned
G16 0730 10    participation in events whose overtones and implications
G16 0740  7    are transcendent. Artistic mimesis under Christian
G16 0750  5    influence records the involvement of all persons, however
G16 0760  5    humble, in a divine drama. The artist, unlike the philosopher,
G16 0770  3    is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified
G16 0780  1    high levels of abstraction. He is the conveyor of a
G16 0780 11    sacred reality by which he has been grasped. I have
G16 0790  9    chosen to use the word "mimesis" in its Christian rather
G16 0800  5    than its classic implications and to discover in the
G16 0810  5    concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological
G16 0820  1    expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the
G16 0820 10    direct consequence of involvement in historical experience,
G16 0830  6    which are not reserved, as in the Greek mind, only
G16 0840  7    to moments of theoretical reflection.
G16 0850  1       In the first instance, "mimesis" is here used to
G16 0850 10    mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid
G16 0860  8    images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional
G16 0870  6    designations. By "image" is meant not only a visual
G16 0880  5    presentation, but also remembered sensations of any
G16 0890  1    of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately
G16 0890 11    conjoined therewith. This is the primary function of
G16 0900  8    the imagination operating in the absence of the original
G16 0910  7    experiential stimulus by which the images were first
G16 0920  3    appropriated. Mimesis is the nearest possible thing
G16 0920 10    to the actual re-living of experience, in which the
G16 0930 10    imagining person recovers through images something
G16 0940  4    of the force and depth characteristic of experience
G16 0950  3    itself. The images themselves, like their counterparts
G16 0960  1    in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed
G16 0960 10    dispassionately; they are fields of force exerting
G16 0970  7    a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique
G16 0980  4    relatedness to one another. They bring an inextricable
G16 0990  1    component of value within themselves, with attractions
G16 0990  8    and repulsions native to their own quality. As in experience
G16 1000  9    one is seized by given entities and their interrelations
G16 1010  6    and is forced to respond in value feelings to them,
G16 1020  5    so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation
G16 1030  1    of images. Mimesis here is not to be confused with
G16 1030 11    literalism or realism in the conventional sense. A
G16 1040  8    word taken in its dictionary meaning, a photographic
G16 1050  4    image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing
G16 1060  1    of a "scene" tends to lose experiential vividness and
G16 1060 10    to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite
G16 1070  7    neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings.
G16 1080  6    Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized
G16 1090  3    so that people react to certain preconceived clues
G16 1100  1    for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their
G16 1100 10    experiential field. A truly vivid imagination moves
G16 1120  7    beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of
G16 1130  5    immediacy.
G16 1130  6       The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness
G16 1140  3    tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic
G16 1150  3    forms and materials. When words can be used in a more
G16 1150 14    fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the
G16 1160 10    force of sights and sounds, when tones of sound and
G16 1170  7    colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the
G16 1180  4    sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and
G16 1180 13    of themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude
G16 1190  8    of attention, all this imitates the way experience
G16 1200  6    itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door
G16 1210  4    of consciousness and clamors for entrance. These are
G16 1220  2    like the initial ways in which the world forces itself
G16 1220 12    upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and
G16 1230  8    choice. The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked
G16 1240  6    by the persistence with which the work demands attention
G16 1250  3    and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely
G16 1260  1    understood.
G16 1260  2       Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain
G16 1270  1    presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human
G16 1270  8    experience which require some exposition before the
G16 1280  6    main argument can proceed. Experience is not seen,
G16 1290  4    as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting us
G16 1300  2    initially with clear and distinct objects simply located
G16 1300 10    in space and registering their character, movements,
G16 1320  5    and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect.
G16 1330  6    Neither is primary experience understood according
G16 1340  2    to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing
G16 1350  1    is thought to be received other than signals of sensory
G16 1350 11    qualities producing their responses in the appropriate
G16 1360  6    sense organs. Primary feelings of the world come neither
G16 1370  6    as a collection of clearly known objects (houses, trees,
G16 1380  3    implements, etc.) nor a collection of isolated and
G16 1390  1    neutral sensory qualities. In contrast to all this,
G16 1390  9    primary data are data of a self involved in environing
G16 1400  8    processes and powers.
G16 1400 11       The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value
G16 1410  7    feelings, both positive and negative: a desire to appropriate
G16 1420  7    this or that part of the environment into oneself;
G16 1430  3    a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part.
G16 1440  2    These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious
G16 1440 10    powers in which one is involved, some working for one's
G16 1450 10    good, others threatening ill. Gone is the tabula rasa
G16 1460  7    of the mind. In its place is a passionate consciousness
G16 1470  5    grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative
G16 1480  3    values even as the actions of one's life are determined
G16 1500  1    by constellations of process in which one is caught.
G16 1500 10       The principal defender of this view of primary experience
G16 1510  8    as "causal efficacy" is Alfred North Whitehead. Our
G16 1520  6    most elemental and unavoidable impressions, he says,
G16 1530  4    are those of being involved in a large arena of powers
G16 1540  2    which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated
G16 1550  1    in a vast movement through the present toward the future.
G16 1550 11    We feel the quality of these powers initially as in
G16 1560  8    some degree wholesome or threatening. Later abstractive
G16 1570  3    and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment
G16 1580  3    in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions
G16 1580 11    themselves are the primary stuff of experience. It
G16 1590  8    takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from
G16 1600  7    the primitive impression of larger unities of power
G16 1610  4    and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection
G16 1620  2    of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and
G16 1620 12    pattern, devoid of all power to move the feelings and
G16 1630 10    actions except in so far as they present themselves
G16 1640  5    for inspection. Whitehead is here questioning David
G16 1650  2    Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he
G16 1660  1    is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems
G16 1660  8    from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely
G16 1670  5    sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy, and
G16 1680  4    that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed
G16 1690  2    to the world, not directly perceived. What Hume calls
G16 1690 11    "sensation" is what Whitehead calls "perception in
G16 1700  7    the mode of presentational immediacy" which is a sophisticated
G16 1710  6    abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy.
G16 1720  7    As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated
G16 1730  5    sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness
G16 1740  1    of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention
G16 1750  1    of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical
G16 1750  9    scepticism. Whitehead contends that the human way of
G16 1760  7    understanding existence as a unity of interlocking
G16 1770  3    and interdependent processes which constitute each
G16 1770  9    other and which cause each other to be and not to be
G16 1780 12    is possible only because the basic form of such an
G16 1790  7    understanding, for all its vagueness and tendency to
G16 1800  3    mistake the detail, is initially given in the way man
G16 1810  1    feels the world. In this respect experience is broader
G16 1810 10    and full of a richer variety of potential meanings
G16 1820  7    than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture
G16 1830  5    are capable of making clear and distinct.
G16 1840  1       A chief characteristic of experience in the mode
G16 1840  9    of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past.
G16 1850  7    Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events
G16 1860  6    that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately
G16 1870  2    very unlike the entity which I now am.
