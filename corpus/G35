G35 0010  1       The United States is always ready to participate
G35 0010  9    with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these
G35 0020  7    or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice.
G35 0030  7       Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the
G35 0040  5    United States has no intention of interfering in the
G35 0050  2    internal affairs of any nation; by the same token,
G35 0050 11    we reject any Soviet attempt to impose its system on
G35 0060  8    us or other peoples by force or subversion.
G35 0070  3       Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples
G35 0080  1    is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has
G35 0080  9    allied us with more than forty other nations in a common
G35 0090  9    defense effort. Not for a moment do we forget that
G35 0100  6    our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries;
G35 0110  2    we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our
G35 0120  1    solemn commitments to them.
G35 0120  5    ##
G35 0120  6    We and our friends are, of course, concerned with self-defense.
G35 0130  5    Growing out of this concern is the realization that
G35 0140  2    all people of the Free World have a great stake in
G35 0140 13    the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly
G35 0150  9    emerging nations. These peoples, desperately hoping
G35 0160  5    to lift themselves to decent levels of living must
G35 0170  4    not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help from, and
G35 0180  1    finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim
G35 0180  9    their hostility to freedom.
G35 0190  3       But they must have technical and investment assistance.
G35 0200  1    This is a problem to be solved not by America alone,
G35 0200 12    but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals
G35 0210  8    and in position to provide help.
G35 0220  2       In recent years America's partners and friends in
G35 0230  1    Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress.
G35 0240  1       The international economy of 1960 is markedly different
G35 0240  9    from that of the early postwar years. No longer is
G35 0250  8    the United States the only major industrial country
G35 0260  3    capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources
G35 0270  2    so urgently needed in the newly developed countries.
G35 0280  1       To remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy
G35 0280  8    nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the
G35 0290  8    less fortunate members that will inspire hope, confidence,
G35 0300  4    and progress. A rich nation can for a time, without
G35 0310  2    noticeable damage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence,
G35 0320  1    making its single goal the material ease and comfort
G35 0320 10    of its own citizens- thus repudiating its own spiritual
G35 0330  8    and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society
G35 0340  4    of nations. But the enmities it will incur, the isolation
G35 0350  3    into which it will descend, and the internal moral
G35 0360  1    and spiritual softness that will be engendered, will,
G35 0360  9    in the long term, bring it to economic and political
G35 0370  7    disaster.
G35 0370  8       America did not become great through softness and
G35 0380  6    self-indulgence. Her miraculous progress in material
G35 0390  3    achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy
G35 0400  1    and substantial: adherence to principles and methods
G35 0400  8    consonant with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction
G35 0410  7    in hard work; the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile
G35 0420  5    causes; the courage to meet every challenge; the intellectual
G35 0430  4    honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of
G35 0440  4    her own best interests.
G35 0440  8       To us and to every nation of the Free World, rich
G35 0450  6    or poor, these qualities are necessary today as never
G35 0460  3    before if we are to march together to greater security,
G35 0460 13    prosperity and peace.
G35 0470  3       I believe that the industrial countries are ready
G35 0480  2    to participate actively in supplementing the efforts
G35 0480  9    of the developing nations to achieve progress.
G35 0490  5       The immediate need for this kind of co-operation
G35 0500  6    is underscored by the strain in this nation's international
G35 0510  2    balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign business
G35 0520  1    transactions has in recent years fallen substantially
G35 0520  8    short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain
G35 0530  7    our military establishments overseas, to finance private
G35 0540  4    investment, and to provide assistance to the less developed
G35 0550  3    nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments
G35 0560  1    approached four billion dollars.
G35 0560  5       Continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude
G35 0570  4    would, over time, impair our own economic growth and
G35 0580  2    check the forward progress of the Free World.
G35 0580 10       We must meet this situation by promoting a rising
G35 0590  8    volume of exports and world trade. Further, we must
G35 0600  5    induce all industrialized nations of the Free World
G35 0610  2    to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty
G35 0610 12    from less fortunate. This co-operation in this matter
G35 0620  8    will provide both for the necessary sharing of this
G35 0630  6    burden and in bringing about still further increases
G35 0640  2    in mutually profitable trade.
G35 0640  6       New Nations, and others struggling with the problems
G35 0650  6    of development, will progress only- regardless of any
G35 0660  6    outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their own
G35 0670  2    destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it.
G35 0670 11    Moreover, progress in a national transformation can
G35 0680  7    be only gradually earned; there is no easy and quick
G35 0690  7    way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. But,
G35 0700  2    just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier
G35 0700 13    years, so now do these new and emerging nations that
G35 0710 10    do have this faith and determination deserve help.
G35 0720  5       Respecting their need, one of the major focal points
G35 0730  5    of our concern is the South-Asian region. Here, in
G35 0740  2    two nations alone, are almost five hundred million
G35 0740 10    people, all working, and working hard, to raise their
G35 0750  7    standards, and in doing so, to make of themselves a
G35 0760  5    strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that
G35 0770  2    would destroy liberty.
G35 0770  5       I cannot express to you the depth of my conviction
G35 0780  4    that, in our own and free world interest, we must co-operate
G35 0790  1    with others to help these people achieve their legitimate
G35 0790 10    ambitions, as expressed in their different multi-year
G35 0800  8    plans. Through the World Bank and other instrumentalities,
G35 0810  6    as well as through individual action by every nation
G35 0820  5    in position to help, we must squarely face this titanic
G35 0830  3    challenge.
G35 0830  4       I shall continue to urge the American people, in
G35 0840  3    the interests of their own security, prosperity and
G35 0840 11    peace, to make sure that their own part of this great
G35 0850 11    project be amply and cheerfully supported. Free world
G35 0860  5    decisions in this matter may spell the difference between
G35 0870  3    world disaster and world progress in freedom.
G35 0880  1       Other countries, some of which I visited last month,
G35 0880 10    have similar needs.
G35 0890  2       A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations
G35 0900  1    which are prepared to assist in the development effort.
G35 0900 10    During the past year I have discussed this matter with
G35 0910  9    the leaders of several Western nations.
G35 0920  2       Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization
G35 0930  1    for European Economic Cooperation could help with the
G35 0930  9    initial studies needed. The goal is to enlist all available
G35 0940 10    economic resources in the industrialized Free World,
G35 0950  6    especially private investment capital.
G35 0960  2       By extending this help, we hope to make possible
G35 0960 11    the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under
G35 0970  7    freedom's banner. No more startling contrast to a system
G35 0980  8    of sullen satellites could be imagined.
G35 0990  2       If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of
G35 0990 12    productive partnership between the less fortunate nations
G35 1000  7    and those that have already achieved a high state of
G35 1010  7    economic advancement, we will make brighter the outlook
G35 1020  4    for a world order based upon security and freedom.
G35 1030  1    Otherwise, the outlook could be dark indeed. We face,
G35 1030 10    indeed, what may be a turning point in history, and
G35 1040  9    we must act decisively and wisely.
G35 1050  1    ##
G35 1050  2    As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives
G35 1060  1    only from a position of broadly based strength.
G35 1060  9       No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed
G35 1070  7    peace, we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness
G35 1080  4    at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the
G35 1090  2    issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually
G35 1090 10    enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out
G35 1100  7    we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions.
G35 1110  6       America possesses an enormous defense power. It
G35 1120  4    is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk
G35 1130  2    general war against us unless we should become so foolish
G35 1130 12    as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully
G35 1140 10    support. It is world-wide knowledge that any power
G35 1150  5    which might be tempted today to attack the United States
G35 1160  4    by surprise, even though we might sustain great losses,
G35 1170  2    would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction.
G35 1170  9    But I once again assure all peoples and all nations
G35 1180  8    that the United States, except in defense, will never
G35 1190  6    turn loose this destructive power.
G35 1200  1       During the past year, our long-range striking power,
G35 1200 10    unmatched today in manned bombers, has taken on new
G35 1210  8    strength as the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile
G35 1220  3    has entered the operational inventory. In fourteen
G35 1230  2    recent test launchings, at ranges of five thousand
G35 1230 10    miles, Atlas has been striking on an average within
G35 1240  8    two miles of the target. This is less than the length
G35 1250  7    of a jet runway- well within the circle of destruction.
G35 1260  1    Incidentally, there was an Atlas firing last night.
G35 1270  2    From all reports so far received, its performance conformed
G35 1270 11    to the high standards I have just described. Such performance
G35 1280 10    is a great tribute to American scientists and engineers,
G35 1290  7    who in the past five years have had to telescope time
G35 1300  7    and technology to develop these long-range ballistic
G35 1310  2    missiles, where America had none before.
G35 1310  8       This year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear
G35 1320  7    powered submarines will enter our active forces, some
G35 1330  6    to be armed with Polaris missiles. These remarkable
G35 1340  2    ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable
G35 1340 11    of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth.
G35 1350  9       To meet situations of less than general nuclear
G35 1360  7    war, we continue to maintain our carrier forces, our
G35 1370  5    many service units abroad, our always ready Army strategic
G35 1380  3    forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian
G35 1390  1    components. The continuing modernization of these forces
G35 1390  8    is a costly but necessary process. It is scheduled
G35 1400  7    to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to
G35 1410  5    our strength.
G35 1410  7       The deployment of a portion of these forces beyond
G35 1420  5    our shores, on land and sea, is persuasive demonstration
G35 1430  1    of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
G35 1430  9    with our allies for collective security. Moreover,
G35 1450  6    I have directed that steps be taken to program on a
G35 1460  7    longer range basis our military assistance to these
G35 1470  2    allies. This is necessary for a sounder collective
G35 1470 10    defense system.
G35 1480  1       Next I refer to our program in space exploration,
G35 1480 10    which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral
G35 1490  9    part of defense research and development.
G35 1500  3       We note that, first, America has already made great
G35 1520  2    contributions in the past two years to the world's
G35 1520 11    fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science.
G35 1530  7    These discoveries are of present interest chiefly to
G35 1540  5    the scientific community; but they are important foundation
G35 1550  3    stones for more extensive exploration of outer space
G35 1560  1    for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.
G35 1560  8       Second, our military missile program, going forward
G35 1570  5    so successfully, does not suffer from our present lack
G35 1580  4    of very large rocket engines, which are necessary in
G35 1590  2    distant space exploration. I am assured by experts
G35 1590 10    that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate
G35 1600  8    for defense requirements.
G35 1610  1       Third, the United States is pressing forward in
G35 1610  9    the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles
G35 1620  8    of many tons into space for exploration purposes.
G35 1630  4       Fourth, in the meantime, it is necessary to remember
G35 1640  3    that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately
G35 1650  1    surrounding the earth. Using launch systems presently
G35 1650  8    available, we are developing satellites to scout the
G35 1660  8    world's weather; satellite relay stations to facilitate
G35 1670  5    and extend communications over the globe; for navigation
G35 1680  4    aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft;
G35 1690  2    and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit
G35 1690 10    the data we seek.
G35 1700  4       Fifth, we have just completed a year's experience
G35 1710  1    with our new space law. I believe it deficient in certain
G35 1710 12    particulars. Suggested improvements will be submitted
G35 1720  6    to the Congress shortly.
G35 1730  1    ##
G35 1730  2    The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded
G35 1730 11    to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual,
G35 1740  7    intellectual, and economic sinews of American life.
G35 1750  6    The steady purpose of our society is to assure justice,
G35 1760  5    before God, for every individual. We must be ever alert
G35 1770  3    that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing
G35 1780  1    of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal
G35 1780 11    boldly with the issues of the day.
G35 1790  5       A year ago, when I met with you, the nation was
G35 1800  2    emerging from an economic downturn, even though the
G35 1800 10    signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently
G35 1810  6    convincing to the doubtful. Today our surging strength
G35 1820  5    is apparent to everyone. 1960 promises to be the most
G35 1830  5    prosperous year in our history.
G35 1830 10       Yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders.
G35 1840  7    Among current problems that require solutions, participated
G35 1850  4    in by citizens as well as government, are:
G35 1860  2       the need to protect the public interest in situations
G35 1860 11    of prolonged labor-management stalemate;
G35 1870  5       the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical
G35 1880  8    problem in one sector of American agriculture;
G35 1890  1       the continuing threat of inflation, together with
G35 1900  1    the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;
G35 1900  7       in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens
G35 1910  9    of equal protection of the law.
