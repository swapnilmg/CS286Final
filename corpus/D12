D12 0010  1       MUCH MORE than shelter, housing symbolizes social
D12 0010  8    status, a sense of "belonging", acceptance within a
D12 0020  8    given group or neighborhood, identification with particular
D12 0030  4    cultural values and social institutions, feelings of
D12 0040  3    pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to human
D12 0050  2    well-being. For almost one-sixth of the national population
D12 0050 12    discrimination in the free selection of residence casts
D12 0060  8    a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as
D12 0070  6    self-evident by most Americans.
D12 0080  1       Few business groups in recent years have come under
D12 0080 10    heavier pressure to face these realities than real
D12 0090  7    estate brokers and home builders. This pressure has
D12 0100  4    urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their
D12 0110  2    professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for
D12 0110 10    the human aspirations of racial minority groups in
D12 0120  7    this country. It is not surprising that, as spokesman
D12 0130  4    for real estate interests, the National Association
D12 0140  1    of Real Estate Boards (NAREB) and its local associations
D12 0150  1    have sought to limit and often ignore much of this
D12 0150 11    pressure.
D12 0160  1       How does the local realtor see himself in the context
D12 0160 11    of housing restrictions based on race, religion or
D12 0170  7    ethnic attachment? What does he conceive his role to
D12 0180  7    be in this area of social unrest? What ought to be,
D12 0190  4    what is his potential role as a force for constructive
D12 0190 14    social change? What social, ethical and theological
D12 0200  7    insights can the church and university help him bring
D12 0210  7    to bear upon his situation?
D12 0220  1       Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's
D12 0220 10    Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these
D12 0230  8    questions. Several New England realtors were invited
D12 0240  6    to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers,
D12 0250  4    political scientists, economists, social psychologists,
D12 0260  1    social ethicists and theologians. Here, in an atmosphere
D12 0270  1    of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought
D12 0270  8    to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question
D12 0280  7    of discrimination in housing and the part each man
D12 0290  6    present played in it.
D12 0290 10       For a number of years, Wesleyan has been drawing
D12 0300  5    varied groups of political and business leaders into
D12 0310  3    these informal discussions with members of the faculty
D12 0320  1    and student body, attempting to explore and clarify
D12 0320  9    aspects of their responsibility for public policy.
D12 0330  5    This article presents our observations of that session,
D12 0340  4    of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty
D12 0350  2    and students saw them.
D12 0350  6       Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant
D12 0360  4    ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors.
D12 0370  2    Within the membership of this group, as has been found
D12 0370 12    true of men in other professional or trade associations,
D12 0380  9    the most ready portrayal of oneself to "the public"
D12 0390  7    is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests
D12 0400  4    of a seller or buyer and mediating between them. Professional
D12 0410  3    responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving
D12 0420  1    the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient
D12 0420 11    manner. But as conversation goes on, particularly among
D12 0430  6    the realtors themselves, another image emerges, that
D12 0440  4    of considerable power and influence in the community.
D12 0450  1    Obviously, much more than customer expectation is determining
D12 0460  1    the realtor's role. Judgments are continually rendered
D12 0460  8    regarding the potential buyers' income, educational
D12 0470  6    level and above all, racial extraction; and whether
D12 0480  4    these would qualify them for "congenial", "happy" relations
D12 0490  3    to other people in certain community areas.
D12 0500  1    #A NARROW PROFESSIONALISM#
D12 0500  4    How explicit such factors have been historically is
D12 0510  3    evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases
D12 0520  1    or in a review of NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34
D12 0520 12    in the Code, adopted in 1924, states that "a Realtor
D12 0530 10    should never be instrumental in introducing into a
D12 0540  6    neighborhood a character of property or occupancy,
D12 0550  3    members of any race or nationality, or any individuals
D12 0560  1    whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property
D12 0560  9    values in that neighborhood". Though the reference
D12 0570  5    to race was stricken by the association in 1950, being
D12 0580  4    an agent of such "detrimental" influences still appears
D12 0590  3    as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed
D12 0590 11    to avoid.
D12 0600  2       The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently
D12 0610  1    expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed
D12 0610  9    stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any
D12 0620  6    realtor who openly introduced non-white, particularly
D12 0630  2    Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas. They
D12 0640  2    would become tagged as men not interested in being
D12 0640 11    purely real estate "professionals" but agitators for
D12 0650  6    some kind of "cause" or "reform", and this was no longer
D12 0660  8    to be a "pro".
D12 0660 12       Obviously what we are confronted with here is the
D12 0670  9    identification of "professional" with narrow skills
D12 0680  4    and specialization, the effective servicing of a client,
D12 0690  4    rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper
D12 0700  1    meaning and associations of one's work. These men-
D12 0700  9    for the most part educated in our "best" New England
D12 0710  8    colleges, well established financially and socially
D12 0720  4    in the community- under kindly but insistent probing,
D12 0730  2    reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria
D12 0730 10    or data for their generalizations about the interests
D12 0740  7    and attitudes of the people they claim to serve, or
D12 0750  7    about the public responses that actually follow their
D12 0760  3    occasional breach of a "client-service relationship".
D12 0770  1       This narrow "professionalism" does not even fit
D12 0770  8    the present realities of their situation, as the pressure
D12 0780  8    of minorities and the power and respectability of the
D12 0790  6    realtors increase. As our discussion continued, the
D12 0800  3    inadequacy of the "client relationship" as an interpretation
D12 0810  1    of their "way of operating" became evident. Realtors
D12 0820  1    live in their communities as specialists in a given
D12 0820 10    area of work, as members of social and professional
D12 0830  6    organizations, as citizens and civic leaders, as church
D12 0840  4    laymen, as university alumni, as newspaper readers,
D12 0850  1    etc. From such communal roles the realtor finds the
D12 0860  9    substance that shapes his moral understanding.
D12 0870  5       It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors
D12 0880  3    in moral situations center in at least three areas:
D12 0890  1    (1) the various ways in which they interpret a particular
D12 0890 11    social issue; (2) their pattern of involvement in the
D12 0900  9    regular legal and political processes; and, most pervasively,
D12 0910  5    (3) their interpretation of who is a "real pro", of
D12 0920  7    what it means to be a professional man in a technical,
D12 0930  3    fragmented society.
D12 0930  5       (1) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding
D12 0940  4    of and role in the racial issue, pleading that they
D12 0950  3    only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their
D12 0950 11    society. There is some reality to this; the Commission
D12 0960  9    on Race and Housing concluded that "there is no reason
D12 0970  7    to believe that real estate men are either more or
D12 0980  6    less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any other
D12 0990  2    segment of the American population". But such a reaction
D12 0990 11    obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both
D12 1000 10    NAREB and its local boards for the maintenance of
D12 1010  8    restrictive clauses and practices. Also, it does not
D12 1020  5    recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually
D12 1030  2    employed.
D12 1030  3       Like business and university groups generally, these
D12 1040  2    men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological
D12 1040 10    and psychological studies and findings that might illumine
D12 1050  8    the decisions they make. Realtors, both generally and
D12 1060  7    in this group, have invariably equated residential
D12 1070  3    integration with a decline in property values, a circumstance
D12 1080  3    viewed with considerable apprehension.
D12 1080  7       Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing
D12 1090  9    and others, however, point to a vast complex of factors
D12 1100  8    that often do not warrant this conclusion. There are
D12 1110  3    increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated
D12 1120  1    residentially without great loss of property values,
D12 1120  8    the white population having taken the initiative in
D12 1130  6    preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes'
D12 1140  4    desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc. Data on
D12 1150  3    the decline of property values in an area after a new
D12 1150 14    racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms
D12 1160 10    of the trends in property values before the group comes
D12 1170  6    in. Often they are able to get in only because the
D12 1180  4    area is declining economically.
D12 1180  8       Significantly, no realtor and few of the faculty
D12 1190  8    present were familiar with any of the six volumes (published
D12 1200  5    by the University of California Press) that present
D12 1210  3    the commission's findings. No one anticipates any radical
D12 1220  1    shift in this situation, but questions concerning reading
D12 1220  9    habits, the availability of such data and the places
D12 1230  9    where it is discussed must surely be raised. The role
D12 1240  6    of both church and university as sources of information
D12 1250  3    and settings within which the implications of such
D12 1250 11    information may be explored needs consideration.
D12 1260  6       Relevant "facts", however, extend beyond considerations
D12 1270  4    of property values and maintenance of "harmonious"
D12 1280  3    neighborhoods. Discussion of minority housing necessarily
D12 1290  1    involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's
D12 1290 10    democratic conviction and religious belief concerning
D12 1300  6    equality of opportunity, the function and limitations
D12 1310  5    of government in the securing of such equality, and
D12 1320  3    the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents
D12 1330  1    of racial agitation and strife.
D12 1330  6    #"AGAINST THE GRAIN OF CREATION"#
D12 1340  1    (2) Realtors realize, of course, that they are involved
D12 1340 10    in an increasingly complex legal and political system
D12 1350  7    that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their
D12 1360  5    relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion
D12 1370  3    of their responsibility for racial discrimination in
D12 1380  2    housing. On the positive side, recent Federal action
D12 1380 10    has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed
D12 1390  8    by the segregationist position; anti-discriminatory
D12 1400  3    statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen
D12 1410  3    states and, while specific provisions have varied,
D12 1410 10    the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.
D12 1420  7       Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed
D12 1430  5    interest, for example, in Connecticut's new housing
D12 1440  3    law as setting standards of equity that they would
D12 1450  1    like "to have to obey", but in support of which none
D12 1450 12    had been willing to go on public record. As far as
D12 1460  9    they were aware, the Connecticut Association of Real
D12 1470  4    Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's
D12 1480  3    passage or lobbied in its support. (This has not been
D12 1480 13    the case everywhere. In 1957, the Real Estate Boards
D12 1490  9    of New York City actively opposed the then pending
D12 1500  6    private housing anti-discrimination law. Official reasoning:
D12 1510  4    the bill was a "wanton invasion of basic property rights".)
D12 1520  5       There are sins of omission as well as commission;
D12 1530  4    the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations,
D12 1540  1    either negative or positive, plays a large part in
D12 1540 10    the public acceptance of such measures and the degree
D12 1550  8    to which they may be effectively enforced. Judicial
D12 1560  3    opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley
D12 1570  3    v. Kraemer (1948) has rendered racial restrictive covenants
D12 1580  2    unenforcible. Such a decision should have placed a
D12 1580 10    powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing
D12 1590  9    industry, but there is little evidence that realtors,
D12 1600  4    or at least their associations, have repudiated the
D12 1610  2    principle in such clauses.
D12 1610  6       In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination
D12 1620  4    in the sale or rental of housing, support by real estate
D12 1630  5    associations for compliance and broadened coverage
D12 1640  1    through additional legislation could help remove the
D12 1640  8    label of "social reformism" that most realtors individually
D12 1650  6    seem determined to avoid. But as yet, no real estate
D12 1660  8    board has been willing officially to support such laws
D12 1670  5    or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority
D12 1680  1    buyers into all-white neighborhoods.
D12 1680  6       One of the roles of the social scientist, ethicist
D12 1690  5    or theologian in our discussions with the realtors
D12 1700  3    became that of encouraging greater awareness of the
D12 1700 11    opportunities offered by the legal and political processes
D12 1710  8    for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in
D12 1730  6    their work. But responsiveness to these opportunities
D12 1740  3    presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good
D12 1750  2    and not simply as a professional, white, American good.
D12 1750 11    Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons
D12 1770  6    are members of a world, let us say a community, that
D12 1780  7    embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is also infinitely
D12 1790  3    richer since it is all-inclusive.
D12 1790  9       That community of all creation is, then, the ultimate
D12 1800  8    object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all
D12 1810  6    moral judgment. Racial discrimination is wrong, then,
D12 1820  2    not because it goes against the grain of a faculty
D12 1820 12    member trying to converse with a few realtors but because
D12 1830  9    it goes against the grain of creation and against the
D12 1840  7    will of the Creator. Thus, moral issues concerning
D12 1850  2    the nature of the legal and political processes take
D12 1860  1    on theological dimensions.
D12 1860  4    #A FRAGMENTED SOCIETY#
D12 1860  7    (3) Over the years, individuals engaged in the sale
D12 1870  6    of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the
D12 1880  4    methods and practices employed. Most realtors and real
D12 1890  2    estate brokers talk of themselves as "professional
D12 1890  9    people" with the cultural and moral values held by
D12 1900  9    the traditional professions. But what significance
D12 1910  4    attaches to "professional", beyond the narrow sense
D12 1920  2    of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs
D12 1920 10    as already noted? Our faculty and students pressed
D12 1930  7    this issue more than any other.
D12 1940  3       As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional
D12 1950  1    was, before the modern period of technical specialization,
D12 1950  9    one who "professed" to be a bearer and critic of his
D12 1960 10    culture in the use of his particular skills.
