C15 0010  1    As autumn starts its annual sweep, few Americans and
C15 0010 10    Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having
C15 0020  7    the world's finest fall coloring. Spectacular displays
C15 0030  3    of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land
C15 0040  2    surface of the earth. The only other regions so blessed
C15 0040 12    are the British Isles, western Europe, eastern China,
C15 0050  7    southern Chile and parts of Japan, New Zealand and
C15 0060  7    Tasmania. Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed
C15 0070  5    compared with the fiery stabs of crimson, gold, purple,
C15 0080  2    bronze, blue and vermilion that flame up in North America.
C15 0090  1    Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great
C15 0090 10    seasonal spectacle; in fact, a freezing autumn dulls
C15 0100  7    the blaze. The best effects come from a combination
C15 0110  4    of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain,
C15 0120  1    followed by sunny days and cool nights. Foliage pilgrimages,
C15 0120 10    either organized or individual, are becoming an autumn
C15 0130  8    item for more and more Americans each year. Below is
C15 0140  7    a specific guide, keyed to the calendar.
C15 0150  1    #NATURE#
C15 0150  2    _CANADA._
C15 0150  3       Late September finds Quebec's color at its peak,
C15 0160  5    especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area
C15 0170  1    south of the St. Lawrence River. In the Maritime provinces
C15 0170 11    farther east, the tones are a little quieter. Ontario's
C15 0180  9    foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10,
C15 0190  9    with both Muskoka (100 miles north of Toronto) and
C15 0200  6    Haliburton (125 miles northwest of Toronto) holding
C15 0210  2    color cavalcades starting Sept. 23. In the Canadian
C15 0220  1    Rockies, great groves of aspen are already glinting
C15 0220  9    gold.
C15 0230  1    _NEW ENGLAND._
C15 0230  1       Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25
C15 0230  9    to Oct. 15, and often hit a height in early October.
C15 0240 10    New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day
C15 0250  6    and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow
C15 0260  3    of the birches. The shades tend to be a little softer
C15 0270  1    in the forests that blanket so much of Maine. In western
C15 0270 12    Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut, the Berkshires
C15 0280  6    are at their vibrant prime the first week of October.
C15 0290  7    #MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES._
C15 0290 10       The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October,
C15 0300  7    choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George
C15 0310  8    and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area. Farther south
C15 0320  5    in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the
C15 0330  3    Catskills in mid-October, notably along routes 23 and
C15 0330 12    23A. About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos
C15 0340  9    in Pennsylvania are magnificent- Renovo holds its annual
C15 0350  7    Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct. 14, 15. New Jersey's
C15 0360  7    color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from
C15 0370  7    the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May.
C15 0380  1    _SOUTHEAST._
C15 0380  1       During the first half of October the Blue Ridge
C15 0380 10    and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle
C15 0390  9    stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia.
C15 0400  7    The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive
C15 0410  6    above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the
C15 0420  4    Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee.
C15 0430  1    _MIDWEST._
C15 0430  2       Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb
C15 0440  2    stretches of color which reach their height from the
C15 0440 11    last few days of September well into October, especially
C15 0450  8    in their northern sections, e.g., Wisconsin's Vilas
C15 0460  4    County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29-Oct.
C15 0480  5    8. In Wisconsin, take route 55 north of Shawano or
C15 0490  4    routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie du Chien.
C15 0500  1    In Michigan, there is fine color on route 27 up to
C15 0500 12    the Mackinac Straits, while the views around Marquette
C15 0510  6    and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular.
C15 0520  5    In Minnesota, Arrowhead County and route 53 north to
C15 0530  6    International Falls are outstanding. Farther south,
C15 0540  2    there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks,
C15 0540 12    with some seasonal peaks as late as early November.
C15 0550  8    Illinois' Shawnee National Forest, Missouri's Iron
C15 0560  5    County and the maples of Hiawatha, Kan. should be at
C15 0570  5    their best in mid-October.
C15 0580  1    _THE WEST._
C15 0580  1       The Rockies have many "Aspencades", which are organized
C15 0580  9    tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage
C15 0590 10    points for viewing the golden panoramas. In Colorado,
C15 0600  6    Ouray has its Fall Color Week Sept. 22-29, Rye and
C15 0610  6    Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept. 24, and Steamboat
C15 0620  3    Springs has a week-long Aspencade Sept. 25-30. New
C15 0630  2    Mexico's biggest is at Ruidoso Oct. 7, 8, while Alamogordo
C15 0640  1    and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct. 1.
C15 0640  9    #AMERICANA#
C15 0650  1    _PLEASURE DOMES._
C15 0650  3       Two sharply contrasting places designed for public
C15 0660  2    enjoyment are now on display.
C15 0660  7       The Corn Palace at Mitchell, S. Dak., "the world's
C15 0670  5    corniest building", has a carnival through Sept. 23
C15 0680  3    headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt. Since
C15 0690  2    1892 ears of red, yellow, purple and white corn have
C15 0690 12    annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create
C15 0700 10    hugh "paintings". The 1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial
C15 0710  7    Centennial, with the pictures including the Lewis and
C15 0720  5    Clark expedition, the first river steamboat, the 1876
C15 0730  3    gold rush, a little red schoolhouse on the prairie,
C15 0730 12    and today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs.
C15 0740  8    The panels will stay up until they are replaced next
C15 0750  9    summer.
C15 0750 10       Longwood Gardens, near Kennett Square, Pa. (about
C15 0760  7    12 miles from Wilmington, Del.), was developed and
C15 0770  5    heavily endowed by the late Pierre S. du Pont. Every
C15 0780  4    Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate
C15 0790  3    colored fountain display, with 229 nozzles throwing
C15 0790 10    jets of water up to 130 feet. The "peacock tail" nozzle
C15 0800 11    throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet
C15 0810 10    high. The gardens themselves are open free of charge
C15 0820  6    the year round, and the 192 permanent employes make
C15 0830  2    sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen
C15 0830 13    indoors or out by any visitor. The greenhouses alone
C15 0840  7    cover 3-1/2 acres.
C15 0840 11    #BOOKS#
C15 0850  1    _CLOCK WITHOUT HANDS._
C15 0850  4       Carson McCullers, after a long, painful illness
C15 0860  2    that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul, has
C15 0860 11    come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped
C15 0870 11    high on best-seller lists even before official publication.
C15 0880  6    Though the subject- segregation in her native South-
C15 0890  5    has been thoroughly worked, Miss McCullers uses her
C15 0900  3    poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm
C15 0910  1    her place at the very top of modern American writing.
C15 0910 11    @
C15 0920  1    _FRANNY AND ZOOEY._
C15 0920  3       With an art that almost conceals art, J. D. Salinger
C15 0930  1    can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts.
C15 0930 11    Here, in the most eagerly awaited novel of the season
C15 0940  9    (his first since The Catcher in the Rye), he tells
C15 0950  7    of a college girl in flight from the life around her
C15 0960  4    and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her
C15 0970  1    25-year-old brother. @
C15 0970  6    _THE HEAD OF MONSIEUR M.,_
C15 0970 11       Althea Urn. A deft, hilarious satire on very high
C15 0980  8    French society involving a statesman with two enviable
C15 0990  5    possessions, a lovely young bride and a head containing
C15 1000  2    such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove
C15 1010  1    it for greater comfort. There is probably a moral in
C15 1010 11    all this about "mind vs. heart". @
C15 1020  5    _A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH._
C15 1020 11       Virgilia Peterson, a critic by trade, has turned
C15 1030  8    her critical eye pitilessly and honestly on herself
C15 1040  5    in an autobiography more of the mind and heart than
C15 1050  3    of specific events. It is an engrossing commentary
C15 1050 11    on a repressive, upper-middle-class New York way of
C15 1060  8    life in the first part of this century. @
C15 1070  3    _DARK RIDER._
C15 1070  5       This retelling by Louis Zara of the brief, anguished
C15 1080  4    life of Stephen Crane- poet and master novelist at
C15 1090  2    23, dead at 28- is in novelized form but does not abuse
C15 1090 14    its tragic subject. @
C15 1100  3    _RURAL FREE,_
C15 1100  5       Rachel Peden. Subtitled A Farmwife's Almanac of
C15 1110  3    Country Living, this is a gentle and nostalgic chronicle
C15 1120  2    of the changing seasons seen through the clear, humorous
C15 1130  1    eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist. @
C15 1130 10    #DANCE#
C15 1130 11    _RUSSIANS, FILIPINOS._
C15 1140  2       Two noted troupes from overseas will get the fall
C15 1150  2    dance season off to a sparkling start. Leningrad's
C15 1150 10    Kirov Ballet, famous for classic purity of technique,
C15 1160  7    begins its first U.S. tour in New York (through Sept.
C15 1170  7    30). The Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company, with music
C15 1180  5    and dances that depict the many facets of Filipino
C15 1190  3    culture, opens its 60-city U.S. tour in San Francisco
C15 1200  1    (through Sept. 24) then, via one-night stands, moves
C15 1200 10    on to Los los Angeles (Sept. 29-Oct. 1).
C15 1210  7    #FESTIVALS#
C15 1220  1    _ACROSS THE LAND._
C15 1220  1       With harvests in full swing, you can enjoy festivals
C15 1220 10    for grapes at Sonoma, Calif. (Sept. 22-24), as well
C15 1230  9    as for cranberries at Bandon, Ore. (Sept. 28-Oct. 1),
C15 1240  8    for buckwheat at Kingwood, W. Va. (Sept. 28-30), sugar
C15 1250  7    cane at New Iberia, La. (Sept. 29-Oct. 1) and tobacco
C15 1260  6    at Richmond, Va. (Sept. 23-30).
C15 1270  1       The mule is honored at Benson, N.C. (Sept. 22,23)
C15 1280  1    and at Boron, Calif. (Sept. 24-Oct. 1), while the legend
C15 1285  1    of the Maid of the Mist is celebrated at Niagara Falls
C15 1290 11    through the 24th. The fine old mansions of U.S. Grant's
C15 1300  9    old home town of Galena, Ill. are open for inspection
C15 1310  7    (Sept. 23, 24). An archery tournament will be held
C15 1320  5    at North Falmouth, Mass. (Sept. 23, 24). The 300th
C15 1330  4    anniversaries of Staten Island (through Sept. 23) and
C15 1340  2    of Mamaroneck, N.Y. (through Sept. 24) will both include
C15 1350  1    parades and pageants.
C15 1350  4    #MOVIES#
C15 1350  5    _PURPLE NOON:_
C15 1350  7       This French film, set in Italy, is a summertime
C15 1360  8    splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny
C15 1370  5    scenery- so breath-taking that at times you almost
C15 1380  2    forget the horrors the movie is dealing with. But slowly
C15 1380 12    they take over as Alain Delon (LIFE, Sept. 15), playing
C15 1390 10    a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy, casually
C15 1400  7    tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going
C15 1410  6    to murder him, then does it even while the American
C15 1420  3    is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit
C15 1420 13    from the act.
C15 1430  3    #RECORDS#
C15 1430  4    _NORMA._
C15 1430  5       Callas devotees will have good reason to do their
C15 1440  5    customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo
C15 1450  1    version of the Bellini opera. Maria goes all out as
C15 1450 11    a Druid princess who gets two-timed by a Roman big
C15 1460  9    shot. By turns, her beautifully sung Norma is fierce,
C15 1470  5    tender, venomous and pitiful. The tenor lead, Franco
C15 1480  2    Corelli, and La Scala cast under Maestro Tullio Serafin
C15 1490  1    are all first rate. @
C15 1500  1    _JEREMIAH PEABODY'S POLYUNSATURATED QUICK DISSOLVING
C15 1510  1    FAST ACTING PLEASANT TASTING GREEN AND PURPLE PILLS._
C15 1510  1       In a raucous take-off on radio commercials, Singer
C15 1510 10    Ray Stevens hawks a cure-all for neuritis, neuralgia,
C15 1520  7    head-cold distress, beriberi, overweight, fungus, mungus
C15 1530  4    and water on the knee. @ Of the nation's eight million
C15 1540  6    pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned
C15 1550  3    that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to
C15 1550 13    be afloat- at least in that broad balmy region that
C15 1560 11    lies below America's belt line. Waterways are busy
C15 1570  6    right now from the Virginia capes to the Texas coast.
C15 1580  5    There true yachtsmen often find November winds steadier,
C15 1590  2    the waters cooler, the fish hungrier, and rivers more
C15 1590 11    pleasant- less turbulence and mud, and fewer floating
C15 1600 10    logs.
C15 1600 11       More and more boats move overland on wheels (1.8
C15 1610  8    million trailers are now in use) and Midwesterners
C15 1620  4    taking long weekends can travel south with their craft.
C15 1630  2    In the Southwest, the fall brings out flotillas of
C15 1630 11    boatsmen who find the summer too hot for comfort. And
C15 1640 10    on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long Island
C15 1650  5    to Lake Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens
C15 1660  5    of frostbite races. Some pleasant fall cruising country
C15 1670  2    is mapped out below.
C15 1670  6    #BOATING#
C15 1670  7    _WEST COAST._
C15 1670  9       Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best
C15 1680  8    months in California as crisp breezes bring out craft
C15 1690  5    of every size on every kind of water- ocean, lake and
C15 1700  3    reservoir. Shore facilities are enormous- Los Angeles
C15 1710  1    harbors 5,000 boats, and Long Beach 3,000- but marinas
C15 1710 10    are crowded everywhere. New docks and ramps are being
C15 1720  8    rushed at Playa del Rey, Ventura, Dana Point, Oceanside
C15 1730  5    and Mission Bay.
C15 1730  8       Inland, outboard motorists welcome cooler weather
C15 1740  6    and the chance to buzz over Colorado River sandbars
C15 1750  4    and Lake Mead. Newest small-boat playground is the
C15 1760  3    Salton Sea, a once-dry desert sinkhole which is now
C15 1760 13    a salty lake 42 miles long and 235 feet below sea level.
C15 1770 12    On Nov. 11, 12, racers will drive their flying shingles
C15 1780  8    in 5-mile laps over its 500-mile speedboat course.
C15 1790  3    In San Francisco Bay, winds are gusty and undependable
C15 1810  1    during this season. A sailboat may have a bone in her
C15 1810 12    teeth one minute and lie becalmed the next. But regattas
C15 1820 10    are scheduled right up to Christmas. The Corinthian
C15 1830  7    Yacht Club in Tiburon launches its winter races Nov.
C15 1840  5    5.
C15 1840  6    _GULF COAST._
C15 1840  8       Hurricane Carla damaged 70% of the marinas in the
C15 1850  7    Galveston-Port Aransas area but fuel service is back
C15 1860  5    to normal, and explorers can roam as far west as Port
C15 1870  2    Isabel on the Mexican border. Sailing activity is slowed
C15 1870 11    down by Texas northers, but power cruisers can move
C15 1880  9    freely, poking into the San Jacinto, Trinity and Brazos
C15 1890  6    rivers (fine tarpon fishing in the Brazos) or pushing
C15 1900  5    eastward to the pirate country of Barataria. Off Grand
C15 1910  3    Isle, yachters often visit the towering oil rigs. The
C15 1910 12    Mississippi Sound leads into a protected waterway running
C15 1920  8    about 200 miles from Pascagoula to Apalachicola.
C15 1930  5    _LOWER MISSISSIPPI._
C15 1930  7       Memphis stinkpotters like McKellar Lake, inside
C15 1940  6    the city limits, and sailors look for autumn winds
C15 1950  5    at Arkabutla Lake where fall racing is now in progress.
C15 1960  4    River cruising for small craft is ideal in November.
C15 1970  1    At New Orleans, 25-mile-square Lake Pontchartrain has
C15 1970 10    few squalls and year-long boating. Marinas are less
C15 1980  8    plush than the Florida type but service is good and
C15 1990  6    Creole cooking better.
C15 1990  9    _TVA LAKES._
C15 2000  1       Ten thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the
C15 2000  8    30-odd lakes in the vast Tennessee River system that
C15 2010  6    loops in and out of seven states. When dam construction
C15 2020  4    began in 1933, fewer than 600 boats used these waters;
C15 2030  2    today there are 48,500.
