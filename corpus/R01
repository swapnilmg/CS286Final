R01 0010  1    It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph
R01 0010 10    of Barco! For it seems that Barco, fancying himself
R01 0020  8    a ladies' man (and why not, after seven marriages?),
R01 0030  4    had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation
R01 0040  4    of his fourth murder victim who had said: "With your
R01 0050  2    beard, dear, you ought to be in movies"!
R01 0050 10       Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman
R01 0060  7    in charge, rushed to the Hollywood police station to
R01 0070  6    report the theft, and less than five minutes later,
R01 0080  3    detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail
R01 0090  1    of Cal Barco.
R01 0090  4       On their way, they stopped at every gas station
R01 0100  1    along the main boulevards to question the attendants.
R01 0100  9    Finally, at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado
R01 0110  7    Avenue, they learned that their man, having paused
R01 0120  5    to get oil for his car, had asked about the route to
R01 0130  3    San Diego. They headed in that direction and, at San
R01 0130 13    Juan Capistrano by-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting
R01 0140  9    in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in, eating
R01 0150  6    a hot tamale. At the moment, Barco's back was to the
R01 0160  5    road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his
R01 0170  3    convertible which, in their quest for the stolen lap
R01 0170 12    rug, they proceeded to search. The robe, however, was
R01 0180  8    missing, for by that time Barco had disposed of it
R01 0190  6    at a pawnshop in Glendale.
R01 0190 11       The detectives placed Barco under arrest and, without
R01 0200  7    informing him of the nature of the charge, took him
R01 0210  7    back to Hollywood for questioning.
R01 0220  1       Thus it was that Barco, apprehended for mere larceny,
R01 0220 10    now began to suspect that one or another of his murders
R01 0230 10    had been uncovered. During the return trip, Barco kept
R01 0240  6    muttering to himself in meaningless phrases, such as:
R01 0250  4    "They're under sand dunes ... They're better off, I
R01 0260  3    tell you ... I saved their souls". The detective, commenting
R01 0270  1    on Barco's behavior, felt that he merely belonged among
R01 0270 10    the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally
R01 0280  8    unhinged- that he was a more or less harmless "nut"!
R01 0290  7       However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft,
R01 0300  5    Barco, in a fit of apprehension, made an attempt to
R01 0310  3    take his own life. The attempt had failed because,
R01 0310 12    when endeavoring to cut his wrists, this murderer of
R01 0320  9    seven women had fainted at the sight of blood. The
R01 0330  7    jail authorities- attaching no particular significance
R01 0340  2    to the episode- offered Barco whisky to revive him;
R01 0350  1    but the old fellow, a lifelong teetotaler, refused
R01 0350  9    it, and no more was thought of the matter.
R01 0360  6       Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered
R01 0370  3    the case. A man of vaulting ambition, with one eye
R01 0380  1    on the mayorship of Los Angeles, nothing ever escaped
R01 0380 10    him which might possibly lead to personal publicity.
R01 0390  6       It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in
R01 0400  6    the city jail had attempted suicide. Welch wanted to
R01 0410  3    know why. No one knew. Now Welch had a pet theory that
R01 0420  1    everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever
R01 0420 11    gets caught at. The suicide attempt looked to him like
R01 0430  8    an opportunity to put his theory to the test. So he
R01 0440  6    paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat
R01 0450  2    by stating bluntly:
R01 0450  5       "Barco, we've got the goods on you! It'll be a lot
R01 0460  7    better if you come clean".
R01 0460 12       At first Barco was evasive and shifty. But with
R01 0470  9    Welch's relentless pursuit of the subject, Barco finally
R01 0480  6    "broke" and started confessing to one murder after
R01 0490  5    another. By the time Barco reached the count of three,
R01 0500  3    the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be
R01 0500 13    true. But if true, it was the case of which he had
R01 0510 11    dreamed, the case which would throw him into headlines
R01 0520  5    all over America as the hero of a great murder trial.
R01 0530  3       Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell. But
R01 0540  2    to Welch's chagrin, the police captain pooh-poohed
R01 0540 10    Welch's credulity in Barco's confession. Barco was
R01 0550  7    clearly a "nut". It required strength, bravado, daring
R01 0560  6    to commit murder. "That worm a murderer? Ridiculous"!
R01 0570  4    Then, for the first time since his arrest, a glint
R01 0580  4    of spirit lit Barco's eyes. His manhood had been attacked.
R01 0590  1    He stiffened and rose to his feet. He'd show them!
R01 0600  1       "Is that so"? he queried. "Well, for ten years I've
R01 0600 11    been murdering women. I can lead you to every one of
R01 0610 11    the bodies, and there ain't four, nor five, nor six
R01 0620  7    of 'em- there's seven!"
R01 0630  1       The next day the police captain, in derision, organized
R01 0630 10    what he termed "Welch's Wild Goose Chase". For indeed
R01 0640  9    it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing
R01 0650  8    murder for ten years and not get caught at it, even
R01 0660  7    in Hollywood. The searching party consisted of the
R01 0670  3    police captain, Welch, Barco, policemen with shovels,
R01 0670 10    newspaper reporters, and cameramen.
R01 0680  4       Barco, his state of apprehension gone, never to
R01 0690  4    return, had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained
R01 0700  1    his principal attitude from that time on. He directed
R01 0700 10    the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica.
R01 0710 10    Stopping the cars at a fork in the road, he got out,
R01 0720  9    paced off a certain distance to a spot between two
R01 0730  3    shrub-covered sand hills, and indicated a location.
R01 0740  1       Orders were given to dig. Nothing was found. Welch
R01 0740 10    was worried. The police captain chortled. The newspaper
R01 0750  7    boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused.
R01 0760  5    With greater precision he again paced off a location,
R01 0770  4    this time a little more to the left.
R01 0770 12       With quibs and gibes, the policemen again started
R01 0780  8    digging. Welch was on edge. The captain was remarking
R01 0790  5    that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one
R01 0800  3    of the shovels struck an object.
R01 0800  9       "There's something here"! said the digger. Joking
R01 0810  6    stopped and everyone gathered around. The digger, thrusting
R01 0820  5    about with his shovel, now raised into view a package
R01 0830  4    crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's Hollywood
R01 0840  1    sport shirts. Although it was a mere fragment of the
R01 0840 11    victim's remains, it was enough. Welch was wild with
R01 0850  8    delight. His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures
R01 0860  5    brought to light one reward after another.
R01 0870  1       Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour,
R01 0870 11    and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice
R01 0880  8    was a new triumph for him. It went to his head, and
R01 0890  8    his ambition increased.
R01 0890 11       It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall
R01 0900  9    and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible
R01 0910  7    sensation into the case. Every new scandal which would
R01 0920  5    provide more "copy" for Marshall's pen would thus mean
R01 0930  5    more publicity for Welch.
R01 0930  9       I knew that both these cynics were waiting with
R01 0940  6    impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called
R01 0950  4    to the stand. Once there, the D.A. with devilish cleverness
R01 0960  2    would provide Marshall with headlines: "Viola's Multiple
R01 0970  2    Romances"... "Viola Lake an Addict"... "Downfall of
R01 0980  2    Another Film Idol"! It would be fine publicity for
R01 0980 11    the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne
R01 0990 11    over the broken reputation of a helpless girl!
R01 1000  6       I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed
R01 1010  4    for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he
R01 1020  2    might be thwarted. It wasn't long before I sensed that
R01 1020 12    there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition
R01 1030  6    back of his desire for Viola's destruction. He was
R01 1040  5    bitter and resentful toward her, personally resentful.
R01 1050  2    A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps
R01 1060  1    he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors-
R01 1060  8    or, even more serious perhaps, that he had attained
R01 1070  8    a share of them and had then been superseded by some
R01 1080  6    luckier chap. I did not rest until I had tracked the
R01 1090  3    mystery down. Well, here it is.
R01 1090  9       One day over a year before, there had been a cocktail
R01 1110  8    party in an apartment of a downtown hotel. Viola had
R01 1120  4    been urged to attend, by telephone, and not knowing
R01 1130  1    the host or the character of the party, she had gone.
R01 1130 12    She arrived late and as she entered the party, noted
R01 1140  9    that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority; the air
R01 1150  6    was thick with smoke, empty bottles were in evidence,
R01 1160  3    and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for
R01 1160 13    liquor.
R01 1170  1       Naturally, Viola had no wish to remain, but she
R01 1170 10    felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival,
R01 1180  8    in all politeness to her host. And it so happened that
R01 1190  7    adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was
R01 1200  3    a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;
R01 1210  1    while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair
R01 1210 10    of feet which, as Fate would have it, belonged to District
R01 1220  9    Attorney Welch.
R01 1230  1       As Viola sat there, a playful impulse overcame her
R01 1230 10    to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified
R01 1240  6    feet and, as a prank, insert rosebuds between the toes.
R01 1250  4       A little later the district attorney woke up, emerged
R01 1260  3    from under the couch, looked at his watch, and realized
R01 1270  1    he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting
R01 1270 12    of the Culture Forum on "The Civic Spirit of the Southland",
R01 1280  9    in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife,
R01 1290  8    as president of the forum, was to preside. He made
R01 1300  5    his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed
R01 1310  2    himself off, neatly arranged his hair, and painstakingly
R01 1310 10    selected his hat from the many on the bed. Then, noting
R01 1320 11    neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence
R01 1330  7    of the rosebuds, he made his way to the Byzantine room
R01 1340  5    and, with his usual dignity, mounted the rostrum. The
R01 1350  2    effect on the intellectuals among his audience may
R01 1350 10    well be imagined.
R01 1360  1       The incident, aside from reflecting on Welch's political
R01 1370  1    career, had all but wrecked his home life. He never
R01 1370 11    rested until he discovered who the culprit was, and
R01 1380  8    when he did, he vowed vengeance on Viola Lake if ever
R01 1390  6    the chance came his way. And here it was! By such innocent
R01 1400  4    actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion.
R01 1410  2       During these first days of the trial I didn't have
R01 1420  1    as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should
R01 1420 11    have liked. In the first place, it was difficult for
R01 1430  7    us to meet. We couldn't be seen together, for the tongue
R01 1440  5    of Scandal was ever ready to link our names, and the
R01 1450  3    tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the
R01 1450 14    association of a man with a girl, no matter how innocent.
R01 1460 11    I couldn't invite Viola to our house, for Mother snobbishly
R01 1470  8    refused to receive her.
R01 1480  1       Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of
R01 1480 11    social values, but Mother had attained a reflected
R01 1490  7    glory through it, which had opened the doors of Los
R01 1500  6    Angeles-Pasadena Society to her. There, Mother was
R01 1510  2    received by the scions of aristocratic lines which
R01 1510 10    are dominated by the Budweisers (of beer derivation),
R01 1520  7    the Chalmers (of underwear origin), and the Heinzes
R01 1530  5    (whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in
R01 1540  3    pickles). I hated being dragged into the salons of
R01 1540 12    these aristocrats. But Mother insisted, for it is seldom
R01 1550  9    indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema
R01 1560  6    is ever received in their exclusive midsts. In fact,
R01 1570  4    it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair
R01 1580  3    that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred
R01 1590  1    barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from
R01 1590  9    the hoi-polloi.
R01 1600  1       Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial
R01 1610  1    opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated
R01 1610  9    abroad, and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles
R01 1620  9    area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high
R01 1630  8    school. But at long last came a time when I broke away
R01 1640  4    from Mother and her society "chi-chi" in order to spend
R01 1650  3    a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home.
R01 1660  1       However, such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during
R01 1660 11    the trial, that every precaution had to be taken to
R01 1670  8    keep my visit from being whispered to the world, Society,
R01 1680  5    and even, alas, to my own mother.
R01 1681  1       When I arrived at Viola's I was shown, to my surprise,
R01 1690  7    into the kitchen. Viola greeted me, in checked apron,
R01 1700  7    ladle in hand, and explained it was the cook's night
R01 1710  6    out and that she herself was preparing dinner.
R01 1720  2       I sat and watched proceedings. There was to be roast
R01 1730  1    chicken with dressing, giblet gravy, asparagus, new
R01 1730  8    peas with a sprig of mint, creamed onions, and mashed
R01 1740  7    potatoes- all chosen, prepared, and cooked by Viola
R01 1750  5    herself.
