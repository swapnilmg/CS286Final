L24 0010  1    About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped,
L24 0010 11    pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end,
L24 0020  9    and went through. "C'mon", he whispered; "floor level's
L24 0030  5    about three feet down, so don't fall". I went through
L24 0040  6    and down, into pitch darkness. He said, "Jist stay
L24 0050  3    still. I'll pull the boards back and then get us a
L24 0060  2    light. Jist stay where you are". I jist stayed where
L24 0060 12    I was while he fumbled around and then walked away.
L24 0070  8    A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle,
L24 0080  6    and I could see.
L24 0080 10       It was a big room, empty except for a few things
L24 0090  7    of Pop's at the far end- a wooden crate on which stood
L24 0100  5    the candle, a spread out blanket, and an unrolled bindle.
L24 0110  2    I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join
L24 0110 13    him; he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded
L24 0120 11    window so no light would show through.
L24 0130  5       I took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed
L24 0140  3    it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket.
L24 0150  1    "You first", I said.
L24 0150  5       He drank and handed it back. "Nice place", I told
L24 0160  4    him. "Listen, I got a buddy I travel with, real nice
L24 0170  3    guy named Larry. I know where he is, right near here.
L24 0170 14    Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too?
L24 0180 10    We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be
L24 0190  7    moving in on you".
L24 0190 11       He hesitated a second, looking at the bottle, before
L24 0200  8    he said "Sure-sure", and I reassured him. "He'll bring
L24 0210  7    a bottle too, and I'll get another one or maybe two
L24 0220  7    while I'm out. You can work on this one while I'm gone,
L24 0230  5    kill it if you want". I took a short swallow from it
L24 0240  3    myself and handed it to him.
L24 0240  9       His "sure-sure" was enthusiastic this time. He put
L24 0250  6    the bottle down. "Git over by the window while there's
L24 0260  3    light, an' I'll put th' candle out. When yuh come back
L24 0270  4    I'll put it out agin till you're both inside".
L24 0280  1       Charlie was waiting, leaning against a building
L24 0280  8    front. "Perfect set-up", I told him. "But we got to
L24 0290 10    go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two. On
L24 0300  6    the way I'll give you the scoop".
L24 0310  1       On the way I gave him the scoop. I bought another
L24 0310 12    pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in
L24 0320 10    in the dark, put back the blanket and then lighted
L24 0330  4    the candle again. I introduced my friend Larry to Pops
L24 0340  3    and we made ourselves comfortable. There was still
L24 0340 11    a little, not much, left in the first bottle and we
L24 0350 10    passed it around once and killed it, and Charlie opened
L24 0360  6    his.
L24 0360  7       I was reminded, amusedly, by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's
L24 0370  7    called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing
L24 0380  6    Lemon Colored Gloves, which Patchen himself read on
L24 0390  3    a record against jazz background. The poem consisted
L24 0390 11    of only two words, the word "Wait", repeated over and
L24 0400 10    over at irregular intervals and with different inflections,
L24 0410  6    and then the word "Now"! and a blaring final chord
L24 0420  6    from the jazz group.
L24 0420 10       This was the same, except that it was the murder
L24 0430  9    of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing
L24 0440  5    gloves. But we could wait all right; there was no hurry.
L24 0450  4    I said, "Wait ... wait" to Charlie and he grinned,
L24 0460  1    digging the reference. We'd heard the record together
L24 0460  9    once.
L24 0470  1       The second bottle passed a few times. Pop was taking
L24 0470 11    long ones, but not showing the effect yet. He seemed
L24 0480  8    as drunk as when I'd first talked to him, but no drunker.
L24 0490  7    He had a capacity; if we'd really been trying to get
L24 0500  5    him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine.
L24 0510  2       About halfway through the second bottle, Charlie
L24 0510  9    looked at me across Pops, who was sitting between us
L24 0520 10    and asked "Now"? I said, "Wait", and handed the bottle
L24 0530  8    to Pops for his final drink. When he handed it back
L24 0540  7    and I had hold of it safely, Pops was looking toward
L24 0550  3    me and I said "Now", to Charlie and he swung the short
L24 0560  3    length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket,
L24 0570  1    once. It was a lead pipe cinch.
L24 0570  8       There was a sound like the one you produce by flicking
L24 0580  5    a watermelon with your finger, only louder, and Pops
L24 0590  3    fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise.
L24 0590 12    Out cold, if not dead; and he'd never known what hit
L24 0600 10    him- he'd never known that anything had hit him.
L24 0610  7       I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his
L24 0620  7    shirt to feel for a heartbeat, but Charlie said "Wait"!-
L24 0630  3    and said it sharply, not as in the Patchen bit, but
L24 0640  2    as an order- so I stopped my hand and looked at him.
L24 0640 14    He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.
L24 0650 10       "We don't want to know whether he's dead, yet. I
L24 0660  7    gauged that blow to be borderline. To kayo him and
L24 0670  5    maybe or maybe not kill. You hit again about twice
L24 0680  1    that hard before we know whether he's dead or not.
L24 0680 11    That way we'll never know which of us really killed
L24 0690  8    him and which was just the accomplice. Dig"?
L24 0700  2       I dug him, I saw his point; it made sense. I took
L24 0710  3    the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it,
L24 0710 13    harder than he had. The thunk was louder, anyway, and
L24 0720 10    I thought I heard bone crack.
L24 0730  3       Charlie said, "Good boy. That did it, if mine didn't.
L24 0750  2    And we'll never know which. All right, now I'll give
L24 0760  1    you a hand".
L24 0760  4       We straightened Pops up and I made sure there was
L24 0770  2    no trace of a heartbeat.
L24 0770  7       I nodded to Charlie. "Let's put him down again the
L24 0780  6    way he was. It's a more natural position". We did that.
L24 0790  4       "How do you feel"? Charlie asked me.
L24 0800  1       "Cool", I told him. "What do you feel"?
L24 0810  1       "Nothing. Well ... maybe I'm exaggerating. It was
L24 0810  8    a kick, but not a big enough one for me to want to
L24 0820 10    take the chance again, except for stakes. But let's
L24 0830  4    not talk about it abstractly until we're out of here.
L24 0840  2    Now, first question: the bottles. Shall we take them
L24 0840 11    all with us, or leave one"?
L24 0850  5       "Take them", I said. "If we left one we'd have to
L24 0860  6    wipe it for fingerprints. Here's the picture we want
L24 0870  3    to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found.
L24 0870 13    This happened in the middle of a drinking bout with
L24 0880 10    another bum. If they'd been working on a bottle or
L24 0890  7    a jug he'd have taken it with him".
L24 0900  1       "Right. And he'd have taken the weapon with him
L24 0900 10    too, so we take that. Now"- He looked around. "I've
L24 0910  9    been careful about fingerprints. How about you"?
L24 0920  6       "Same. There are the boards over the window, of
L24 0930  7    course, but they're not painted and too rough to take
L24 0940  4    prints. Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge.
L24 0950  1    Besides, I doubt if the cops will even try dusting.
L24 0950 11    They find dead winos every day, maybe they won't even
L24 0960  8    autopsy him for the cause of death".
L24 0970  2       "We can't take a chance on that. We've got to assume
L24 0980  2    they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep
L24 0980 12    the picture consistent. Our hypothetical other bum
L24 0990  7    who killed him would have turned out his pockets. Let's
L24 1000  6    do that". We did that and found a dirty handkerchief,
L24 1010  4    some matches and fourteen cents in change. We took
L24 1020  2    the matches- they were book matches and once they'd
L24 1020 11    been touched might retain fingerprints- and the change.
L24 1030  7       We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical
L24 1040  7    other bum would have left it burning to light his way
L24 1050  6    to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow
L24 1060  3    it out. The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it
L24 1060 16    wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out.
L24 1070 10    A fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would
L24 1080  6    cause Pops to be found sooner. He might not be found
L24 1090  5    for days, even weeks, otherwise.
L24 1090 10       We went once more over every point, then triple-checked.
L24 1100  8    Being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way
L24 1110  7    out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger,
L24 1120  2    and we weren't picked up by a cop. In fact, nobody
L24 1120 13    saw us, cop or citizen. Winsett is a quiet street with
L24 1130 11    no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour.
L24 1140  6    Which, if it matters, was one A.M. Less than three
L24 1150  4    hours ago we'd decided, in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo,
L24 1160  4    to commit a trial murder. It had gone like clockwork.
L24 1170  1    Almost too smoothly, I found myself thinking, and then
L24 1170 10    told myself that was ridiculous. How safe is too safe?
L24 1180 10    Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad.
L24 1190  8       An hour later we were back in my unpadded pad, killing
L24 1200  6    what had been left of the second pint. We decided to
L24 1210  3    leave the third one intact for tomorrow. Also our plans
L24 1210 13    for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit
L24 1220 11    mine. But we were really going to do it. We shook hands
L24 1230 10    on it.
L24 1230 12       We planned ahead only one step, a rendezvous for
L24 1240  8    tomorrow when we could swap notes. I'd tell him everything
L24 1250  5    I'd learned about Seaton's habits and habitat, and
L24 1260  4    he'd tell me the score on Radic. We made the date for
L24 1270  2    two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad.
L24 1270 11    Charlie would get there early because he had the key.
L24 1280 10    From here on in, the less Charlie and I were seen together
L24 1290  8    in public, or visited one another's rooms, the better.
L24 1300  4       I was dead tired and slept soundly, as far as I
L24 1310  5    know dreamlessly.
L24 1310  7       We met at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay
L24 1320  6    as long as it took, into or even through the evening,
L24 1330  2    to talk things out. Charlie had brought food and we'd
L24 1330 12    decided on no drinks. I'd brought along the virgin
L24 1340  9    pint from last night, but we were going to kill that
L24 1350  8    only when we were through talking.
L24 1360  1       I talked first, telling him everything I knew about
L24 1360 10    Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements. I drew
L24 1370  8    diagrams and floor plans; he memorized them thoroughly
L24 1380  5    and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed
L24 1390  3    them down. He gave me equivalent and even more detailed
L24 1400  1    dope on Radic, including diagrams- one of the apartment
L24 1400 10    building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself.
L24 1410 10    He'd been there several times, back when, while he
L24 1420  6    and Radic had been friends, or at least not enemies.
L24 1430  3       It didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might;
L24 1440  3    it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie
L24 1450  1    said, "Well, I guess that's it. Shall we flip a coin
L24 1450 12    to see which of us goes first? Or would you rather
L24 1460 10    deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin
L24 1470  8    rummy, or what"?
L24 1470 11       "Wait a minute, Charlie", I said. "One thing we
L24 1480  8    haven't discussed, expense money. We'll need some at
L24 1490  6    least, if only bus fare to the scene of the crime.
L24 1500  5    And if you're as flat broke as I am, I think we'll
L24 1510  2    have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling
L24 1510 13    station or something before we split for one of us
L24 1520 10    to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work".
L24 1530  7       He sighed. "All right, I'll come clean. I've got
L24 1540  5    a little stashed for a rainy day, and I guess this
L24 1550  3    is rainy enough. A couple of hundred. If you draw the
L24 1550 14    short straw I'll lend you some bread, like fifty bucks,
L24 1560 10    before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco. Then,
L24 1570  9    after I'm back, another fifty so you can put some mileage
L24 1580  8    on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while
L24 1590  3    I take care of your seat cover boy".
L24 1590 11       "Solid", I said. I took a deep breath, and the plunge.
L24 1600 11    "In that case, let's not draw. I'll go to bat first.
L24 1610  6    You'd have to wait till Seaton's back from Mexico City
L24 1620  5    and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have
L24 1630  5    an alibi for D-night. So it wouldn't be for days or
L24 1640  4    even a week before you could do anything. But your
L24 1640 14    friend Manny can go any time".
L24 1650  6       He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder. "I was
L24 1660  3    hoping you'd say that, Willy. But I wouldn't have suggested
L24 1670  3    it. Well- in that case, I take off tomorrow morning
L24 1680  1    for Frisco. And, in case, I brought the money with
L24 1680 11    me".
