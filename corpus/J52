J52 0010  1    But neither was the statement empirical, for goodness
J52 0010  9    was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be
J52 0020  8    seen or heard. What were they to do, then, with these
J52 0030  5    awkward judgments of value? To find a place for them
J52 0040  2    in their theory of knowledge would require them to
J52 0040 11    revise the theory radically, and yet that theory was
J52 0050  8    what they regarded as their most important discovery.
J52 0060  4    It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way
J52 0070  4    only. If it could be shown that judgments of good and
J52 0070 15    bad were not judgments at all, that they asserted nothing
J52 0080 10    true or false, but merely expressed emotions like "Hurrah"
J52 0090  6    or "Fiddlesticks", then these wayward judgments would
J52 0100  6    cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest.
J52 0110  5    This is the course the positivists took. They explained
J52 0120  2    value judgments by explaining them away.
J52 0120  8       Now I do not think their view will do. But before
J52 0130  8    discussing it, I should like to record one vote of
J52 0140  6    thanks to them for the clarity with which they have
J52 0150  2    stated their case. It has been said of John Stuart
J52 0150 12    Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found
J52 0160 10    out. This theory has been put so clearly and precisely
J52 0170  6    that it deserves criticism of the same kind, and this
J52 0180  3    I will do my best to supply. The theory claims to show
J52 0190  1    by analysis that when we say, "That is good", we do
J52 0190 12    not mean to assert a character of the subject of which
J52 0200  8    we are thinking. I shall argue that we do mean to do
J52 0210  7    just that.
J52 0210  9       Let us work through an example, and the simpler
J52 0220  4    and commoner the better. There is perhaps no value
J52 0230  1    statement on which people would more universally agree
J52 0230  9    than the statement that intense pain is bad. Let us
J52 0240  8    take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be
J52 0250  7    interested on the legislative side and in which I think
J52 0260  3    every one of us might naturally make such a statement.
J52 0260 13    We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of
J52 0270 12    the brutal traps in common use. There are signs that
J52 0280  7    it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy
J52 0290  6    of hunger, pain, and fear, it has all but eaten off
J52 0300  2    its own leg. The attempt failed: the animal is now
J52 0300 12    dead. As we think of the long and excruciating pain
J52 0310  8    it must have suffered, we are very likely to say: "It
J52 0320  5    was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer
J52 0330  2    so". The positivist tells us that when we say this
J52 0330 12    we are only expressing our present emotion. I hold,
J52 0340  8    on the contrary, that we mean to assert something of
J52 0350  6    the pain itself, namely, that it was bad- bad when
J52 0360  5    and as it occurred.
J52 0360  9       Consider what follows from the positivist view.
J52 0370  3    On that view, nothing good or bad happened in the case
J52 0380  1    until I came on the scene and made my remark. For what
J52 0380 13    I express in my remark is something going on in me
J52 0390 10    at the time, and that of course did not exist until
J52 0400  5    I did come on the scene. The pain of the rabbit was
J52 0410  2    not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that
J52 0410 11    pain was being endured; badness, in the only sense
J52 0420  8    in which it is involved at all, waited for its appearance
J52 0430  7    till I came and looked and felt. Now that this is at
J52 0440  5    odds with our meaning may be shown as follows. Let
J52 0450  1    us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not
J52 0450 11    come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered.
J52 0460  8    Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad
J52 0470  6    occurred in the sense in which we said it did? Clearly
J52 0480  2    not. Indeed we should say, on the contrary, that the
J52 0480 12    accident of our later discovery made no difference
J52 0490  8    whatever to the badness of the animal's pain, that
J52 0500  6    it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance
J52 0510  4    passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel
J52 0520  1    repugnance or not. If so, then it is clear that in
J52 0520 12    saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing
J52 0530  7    our feelings only. We are saying that the pain was
J52 0540  4    bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took
J52 0540 14    an attitude toward it.
J52 0550  4       The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in
J52 0560  2    which we use the method of difference. It removes our
J52 0560 12    present expression and shows that the badness we meant
J52 0570  9    would not be affected by this, whereas on positivist
J52 0580  6    grounds it should be. The second argument applies the
J52 0590  3    method in the reverse way. It ideally removes the past
J52 0600  1    event, and shows that this would render false what
J52 0600 10    we mean to say, whereas on positivist grounds it should
J52 0610  7    not. Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact
J52 0620  6    fall into the trap and did not suffer at all, but that
J52 0630  2    we mistakenly believe it did, and say as before that
J52 0630 12    its suffering was an evil thing. On the positivist
J52 0640  8    theory, everything I sought to express by calling it
J52 0650  6    evil in the first case is still present in the second.
J52 0660  3    In the only sense in which badness is involved at all,
J52 0660 14    whatever was bad in the first case is still present
J52 0670 10    in its entirety, since all that is expressed in either
J52 0680  7    case is a state of feeling, and that feeling is still
J52 0690  4    there. And our question is, is such an implication
J52 0700  1    consistent with what we meant? Clearly it is not. If
J52 0700 11    anyone asked us, after we made the remark that the
J52 0710  9    suffering was a bad thing, whether we should think
J52 0720  4    it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident
J52 0730  1    had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at
J52 0730 11    all, we should say that it made all the difference
J52 0740  8    in the world, that what we were asserting to be bad
J52 0750  5    was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred
J52 0760  1    back there, that if this had not occurred, there was
J52 0760 11    nothing left to be bad, and that our assertion was
J52 0770  8    in that case mistaken. The suggestion that in saying
J52 0780  4    something evil had occurred we were after all making
J52 0790  1    no mistake, because we had never meant anyhow to say
J52 0790 11    anything about the past suffering, seems to me merely
J52 0800  8    frivolous. If we did not mean to say this, why should
J52 0810  6    we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had
J52 0820  2    not occurred? On the theory before us, such relief
J52 0820 11    would be groundless, for in that suffering itself there
J52 0830  8    was nothing bad at all, and hence in its nonoccurrence
J52 0840  6    there would be nothing to be relieved about. The positivist
J52 0850  4    theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition.
J52 0860  1       So far as I can see, there is only one way out for
J52 0870  1    the positivist. He holds that goodness and badness
J52 0870  9    lie in feelings of approval or disapproval. And there
J52 0880  6    is a way in which he might hold that badness did in
J52 0890  5    this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without
J52 0900  2    belonging to the pain itself. The pain in itself was
J52 0900 12    neutral; but unfortunately the rabbit, on no grounds
J52 0910  8    at all, took up toward this neutral object an attitude
J52 0920  6    of disapproval and that made it for the first time,
J52 0930  3    and in the only intelligible sense, bad. This way of
J52 0930 13    escape is theoretically possible, but since it has
J52 0940  8    grave difficulties of its own and has not, so far as
J52 0950  9    I know, been urged by positivists, it is perhaps best
J52 0960  4    not to spend time over it.
J52 0960 10       I come now to a third argument, which again is very
J52 0970  6    simple. When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark
J52 0980  5    about its suffering being a bad thing, we presumably
J52 0990  1    make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly
J52 0990 10    right in saying that such remarks do usually express
J52 1000  8    feeling. But suppose that a week later we revert to
J52 1010  7    the incident in thought and make our statement again.
J52 1020  2    And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed
J52 1020 11    that the feeling with which we made the remark in the
J52 1030 11    first place has faded. The pathetic evidence is no
J52 1040  6    longer before us; and we are now so fatigued in body
J52 1060  4    and mind that feeling is, as we say, quite dead. In
J52 1070  1    these circumstances, since what was expressed by the
J52 1070  9    remark when first made is, on the theory before us,
J52 1080  8    simply absent, the remark now expresses nothing. It
J52 1090  3    is as empty as the word "Hurrah" would be when there
J52 1100  2    was no enthusiasm behind it. And this seems to me untrue.
J52 1100 13    When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a
J52 1110 10    bad thing, the feeling with which we made it last week
J52 1120  8    may be at or near the vanishing point, but if we were
J52 1130  5    asked whether we meant to say what we did before, we
J52 1140  1    should certainly answer Yes. We should say that we
J52 1140 10    made our point with feeling the first time and little
J52 1150  8    or no feeling the second time, but that it was the
J52 1160  6    same point we were making. And if we can see that what
J52 1170  2    we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling
J52 1170 12    varies from intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling
J52 1180 10    that we primarily meant to express.
J52 1190  3       I come now to a fourth consideration. We all believe
J52 1200  1    that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude
J52 1200 12    is fitting and another not; but on the theory before
J52 1210  9    us such a belief would not make sense. Broad and Ross
J52 1220  7    have lately contended that this fitness is one of the
J52 1230  5    main facts of ethics, and I suspect they are right.
J52 1240  1    But that is not exactly my point. My point is this:
J52 1240 12    whether there is such fitness or not, we all assume
J52 1250  9    that there is, and if we do, we express in moral judgments
J52 1260  5    more than the subjectivists say we do. Let me illustrate.
J52 1270  3       In his novel The House of the Dead, Dostoevsky tells
J52 1280  2    of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp. Whatever
J52 1290  1    the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today, Dostoevsky's
J52 1290 11    companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined.
J52 1300 11    "I have heard stories", he writes, "of the most terrible,
J52 1310  8    the most unnatural actions, of the most monstrous murders,
J52 1320  6    told with the most spontaneous, childishly merry laughter".
J52 1330  4    Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing
J52 1340  4    of others or the causing of suffering there is something
J52 1350  1    very unfitting. If we were asked why we thought so,
J52 1350 11    we should say that these things involve great evil
J52 1360  7    and are wrong, and that to take delight in what is
J52 1370  5    evil or wrong is plainly unfitting. Now on the subjectivist
J52 1380  1    view, this answer is ruled out. For before someone
J52 1380 10    takes up an attitude toward death, suffering, or their
J52 1390  9    infliction, they have no moral quality at all. There
J52 1400  7    is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude
J52 1410  3    of approval or condemnation could be fitting. They
J52 1410 11    are in themselves neutral, and, so far as they get
J52 1420 10    a moral quality, they get it only through being invested
J52 1430  7    with it by the attitude of the onlooker. But if that
J52 1440  4    is true, why is any attitude more fitting than any
J52 1450  1    other? Would applause, for example, be fitting if,
J52 1450  9    apart from the applause, there were nothing good to
J52 1460  7    applaud? Would condemnation be fitting if, independently
J52 1470  4    of the condemnation, there were nothing bad to condemn?
J52 1480  3    In such a case, any attitude would be as fitting or
J52 1480 14    unfitting as any other, which means that the notion
J52 1490  9    of fitness has lost all point.
J52 1500  3       Indeed we are forced to go much farther. If goodness
J52 1510  1    and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought
J52 1510 11    into being by them, those men who greeted death and
J52 1520  9    misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the
J52 1530  5    only sensible line. If there is nothing evil in these
J52 1540  3    things, if they get their moral complexion only from
J52 1540 12    our feeling about them, why shouldn't they be greeted
J52 1550  8    with a cheer? To greet them with repulsion would turn
J52 1560  6    what before was neutral into something bad; it would
J52 1570  4    needlessly bring badness into the world; and even on
J52 1580  2    subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright.
J52 1580 10    On the other hand, to greet them with delight would
J52 1590  9    convert what before was neutral into something good;
J52 1600  4    it would bring goodness into the world.
