J53 0010  1       The injured German veteran was a former miner, twenty-four
J53 0010 11    years old, who had been wounded by shrapnel in the
J53 0020 10    back of the head. This resulted in damage to the occipital
J53 0030  7    lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum
J53 0040  5    also. In any event, the extraordinary result of this
J53 0050  3    injury was that he became "psychically blind", while
J53 0050 11    at the same time, apparently, the sense of touch remained
J53 0060 10    essentially intact. Psychical blindness is a condition
J53 0070  6    in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images,
J53 0080  5    a condition in which, for example, one is unable to
J53 0090  4    remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture
J53 0100  1    of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in
J53 0100 11    his absence. This circumstance in the patient's case
J53 0110  7    plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically
J53 0120  4    in sound working order constitutes its exceptional
J53 0130  2    value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented
J53 0140  1    by the authors is overwhelming that, when the patient
J53 0140 10    closed his eyes, he had absolutely no spatial (that
J53 0150  7    is, third-dimensional) awareness whatsoever. The necessary
J53 0160  4    inference, as the authors themselves interpret it,
J53 0170  2    would seem to be this: "(1) Spatial qualities are not
J53 0170 12    among those grasped by the sense of touch, as such.
J53 0180 10    We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the
J53 0190  8    sense of touch by itself. (2) Spatiality becomes part
J53 0200  4    of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations;
J53 0210  2    that is, there is, in the true sense, only a visual
J53 0220  1    space". The underlying assumption, of course, is that
J53 0220  9    only sight and touch enable us, in any precise and
J53 0230 10    fully dependable way, to locate objects in space beyond
J53 0240  6    us, the other senses being decidedly inferior, if not
J53 0250  3    totally inadequate, in this regard. This is an assumption
J53 0260  1    with which few would be disposed to quarrel. Therefore,
J53 0260 10    if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there
J53 0270  8    is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind
J53 0280  8    person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled,
J53 0290  6    the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself
J53 0300  4    cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality
J53 0310  1    of things and that actual sight or visual representations
J53 0310 10    are necessary.
J53 0320  2       The force of the authors' analysis (if indeed it
J53 0330  1    has any force) can be felt by the reader, I believe,
J53 0330 12    only after three questions have been successfully answered.
J53 0340  6    (1) What allows us to think that the patient had no
J53 0350  6    third-dimensional representations when his eyes were
J53 0360  3    closed? (2) What evidence is there that he was psychically
J53 0370  1    blind? (3) How can we be sure that his sense of touch
J53 0370 13    was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury? We
J53 0380  7    shall consider these in the inverse order of their
J53 0390  5    presentation.
J53 0390  6       Obviously, a satisfactory answer to the third question
J53 0400  6    is imperative, if the argument is to get under way
J53 0410  4    at all, for if there is any possibility of doubt whether
J53 0420  1    the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired
J53 0420  8    by the occipital lesion, any findings whatsoever in
J53 0430  6    regard to the first question become completely ambiguous
J53 0440  3    and fail altogether, of course, as evidence to establish
J53 0450  2    the desired conclusion. The answer the authors give
J53 0450 10    to it, therefore, is of supreme importance. It is as
J53 0460  9    follows: "The usual sensitivity tests showed that the
J53 0470  6    specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness (pressure,
J53 0480  2    pain, temperature), as well as the kinesthetic sensations
J53 0500  1    (muscular feelings, feelings in the tendons and joints),
J53 0500  9    were, as such, essentially intact, although they seemed,
J53 0510  8    in comparison with normal reactions, to be somewhat
J53 0520  6    diminished over the entire body. The supposed tactual
J53 0530  3    sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient
J53 0540  1    and his ability to specify the location of a member,
J53 0540 11    as well as the direction and scope of a movement, passively
J53 0550  9    executed (with one of his members), proved to have
J53 0560  6    been, on the contrary, very considerably affected".
J53 0570  2    The authors insist, however, that these abnormalities
J53 0570  9    in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic
J53 0580 11    disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries
J53 0590  8    which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight.
J53 0600  6       First of all, what is their evidence that the tactual
J53 0610  4    apparatus was fundamentally undamaged? (1) When an
J53 0620  2    object was placed in the patient's hand, he had no
J53 0620 12    difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold,
J53 0630  7    sharp or blunt, rough or smooth, flexible, soft, or
J53 0640  4    hard; and he could tell, simply by the feel of it,
J53 0650  2    whether it was made of wood, iron, cloth, rubber, and
J53 0650 12    so on. And he could recognize, by touch alone, articles
J53 0660  8    which he had handled immediately before, even though
J53 0670  4    they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not
J53 0680  3    be identified by him; that is, he was unaware what
J53 0680 13    kind of objects they were or what their use was. (2)
J53 0690 11    The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a
J53 0700  6    new trade. Because of his brain injury and the extreme
J53 0710  4    damage suffered to his sight, the patient had to train
J53 0720  1    himself for a new line of work, that of a portfolio-maker,
J53 0720 13    an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in
J53 0730  8    the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed
J53 0740  6    sense of form and contour. It seems clear, when one
J53 0750  3    takes into consideration the exceedingly defective
J53 0750  9    eyesight of the patient (we shall describe it in detail
J53 0760 10    in connection with our second question, the one concerning
J53 0770  6    the psychical blindness of the patient), that he had
J53 0780  5    to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual
J53 0790  2    portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty
J53 0790  9    was most probably more sensitive to shape and size
J53 0800  7    than that of a person with normal vision. And so the
J53 0810  5    authors conclude: "The conduct of the patient in his
J53 0820  3    every-day life and in his work, even more than the
J53 0820 14    foregoing facts [mentioned above under 1], leave positively
J53 0830  8    no room for doubt that the sense of touch, in the ordinary
J53 0840  9    sense of the word, was unaffected; or, to put the same
J53 0850  6    thing in physiological terms, that the performance-capacity
J53 0860  1    of the tactual apparatus, from the periphery up to
J53 0870  1    the tactual centers in the brain,- that is, from one
J53 0870 11    end to the other- was unimpaired".
J53 0880  5       If the argument is accepted as essentially sound
J53 0890  2    up to this point, it remains for us to consider whether
J53 0890 13    the patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially
J53 0900  7    and in locating objects in space with the sense of
J53 0910  8    touch can be explained by his defective visual condition.
J53 0920  3    But before we can do this, we must first find answers
J53 0930  2    to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps
J53 0940  1    be in a position to provide something like a complete
J53 0940 11    answer to the question at hand.
J53 0950  3       In what ways, then, did the patient's psychical
J53 0960  1    blindness manifest itself? He could not see objects
J53 0960  9    as unified, self-contained, and organized figures,
J53 0970  6    as a person does with normal vision. The meaning of
J53 0980  5    this, as we shall see, is that he had no fund of visual
J53 0990  3    memory-images of objects as objects; and, therefore,
J53 0990 11    he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon
J53 1000  8    seeing them again. Instead, he constantly became lost
J53 1010  5    in parts and components of them, confused some of their
J53 1020  4    details with those of neighboring objects, and so on,
J53 1030  2    unless he allowed time to "trace" the object in question
J53 1030 12    through minute movements of the head and hands and
J53 1040  9    in this way to discover its contours. According to
J53 1050  5    his own testimony, he never actually saw things as
J53 1060  2    shaped but only as generally amorphous "blots" of color
J53 1060 11    of a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they
J53 1070 11    slipped pretty much out of focus altogether. But by
J53 1080  8    the tracing procedure, he could, in a strange obviously
J53 1090  5    kinesthetic manner, find the unseen form; could piece,
J53 1100  2    as it were, the jumbled mass together into an organized
J53 1100 12    whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle
J53 1110 11    or whatever it turned out to be. If, however, the figure
J53 1120  8    to be discerned were complicated, composed of several
J53 1130  4    interlocking subfigures, and so on, even the tracing
J53 1140  1    process failed him, and he could not focus even relatively
J53 1140 11    simple shapes among its parts. This meant, concretely,
J53 1150  8    that the patient could not read at all without making
J53 1160  7    writing-like movements of the head or body, became
J53 1170  3    easily confused by "hasher marks" inserted between
J53 1170 10    hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one
J53 1180  9    of the letters, and could recognize a simple straight
J53 1190  6    line or a curved one only by tracing it.
J53 1200  2       The patient himself denied that he had any visual
J53 1200 11    imagery at all; and there was ample evidence of the
J53 1210 10    following sort to corroborate him. After a conversation
J53 1220  5    with another man, he was able to recount practically
J53 1230  3    everything that had been said but could not describe
J53 1240  1    at all what the other man looked like. Nor could he
J53 1240 12    call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives.
J53 1250  6    In short, both his own declarations and his figural
J53 1260  4    blindness, when he looked at objects, seem to present
J53 1270  2    undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory
J53 1270 11    at all. He was oblivious of the form of the object
J53 1280 10    actually being viewed, precisely because he could not
J53 1290  5    assign it to a visual shape, already learned and held
J53 1300  3    in visual memory, as persons of normal vision do. He
J53 1300 13    could not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar
J53 1310  8    with it because he had no visual memory at all. Therefore,
J53 1320  8    his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again
J53 1330  6    for each new visual experience of the same individual
J53 1340  2    object or type of object; and this he could do only
J53 1340 13    by going over its mass with the tracing procedure.
J53 1350  9    Then he might finally recognize it, apparently by combining
J53 1360  6    the visual blot, actually being seen, with tactual
J53 1370  4    feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing
J53 1380  1    movements. This would mean, it can readily be seen,
J53 1380 10    that, again, for each new visual experience the tracing
J53 1390  8    motions would have to be repeated because of the absence
J53 1400  5    of visual imagery.
J53 1400  8       As one would surmise, the procedure, however, could
J53 1410  6    be repeated with the same object or with the same type
J53 1420  6    of object often enough, so that the corresponding visual
J53 1430  2    blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement
J53 1430 11    would provide clues as to the actual shape, which the
J53 1440 10    patient then immediately could determine by a kind
J53 1450  6    of inference. Men, trees, automobiles, houses, and
J53 1460  3    so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life-
J53 1470  3    had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became
J53 1470 11    easily recognizable, at the very beginning of tracing,
J53 1480  7    by an inference as to what each was. Dice, for example,
J53 1490  6    he inferred from black dots on a white surface. He
J53 1500  2    evidently could not actually see the corners of these
J53 1500 11    objects, but their size and the dots gave them away.
J53 1510 10    And the authors give numerous instances of calculated
J53 1520  5    guessing on the patient's part to show how large a
J53 1530  5    role it played in his process of readapting himself
J53 1540  1    and how proficient he became at it. Often he seems
J53 1540 11    even to have been able to guess correctly, without
J53 1550  6    the tracing motions, solely on the basis of qualitative
J53 1560  3    differences among the blot-like things which appeared
J53 1570  1    in his visual experience.
J53 1570  5       Perhaps the very important question- What is, then,
J53 1580  6    exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's
J53 1590  2    ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the
J53 1590 12    tracing movements when he is actually looking at things?-
J53 1600  9    has now been raised in the reader's mind and in the
J53 1610  9    following form. If the patient can perceive figure
J53 1620  4    kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually,
J53 1630  1    then, it would seem, the sense of touch has immediate
J53 1630 11    contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence
J53 1640  9    of visual representations, at least in regard to two
J53 1650  7    dimensions, and, as we shall see, even this much spatial
J53 1660  4    awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by
J53 1670  2    the authors. How, then, do the kinesthetic sensations
J53 1670 10    function in all this? The authors set about answering
J53 1680  8    this fundamental question through a detailed investigation
J53 1690  5    of the patient's ability, tactually, (1) to perceive
J53 1700  4    figure and (2) to locate objects in space, with his
J53 1710  1    eyes closed (or turned away from the object concerned).
J53 1710 10    Quite naturally, they make the investigation, first,
J53 1720  6    by prohibiting the patient from making any movements
J53 1730  4    at all and then, later, by repeating it and allowing
J53 1740  1    the patient to move in any way he wanted to.
J53 1740 11       When the patient was not allowed to move his body
J53 1750  9    in any way at all, the following striking results occurred.
