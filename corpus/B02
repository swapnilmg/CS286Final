B02 0010  1    #MUST BERLIN REMAIN DIVIDED?#
B02 0010  5    The inference has been too widely accepted that because
B02 0020  4    the Communists have succeeded in building barricades
B02 0030  1    across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment
B02 0030 10    of that living city.
B02 0040  4       So far as the record is concerned, the Western powers
B02 0050  2    have not acquiesced and should not do so.
B02 0050 10       Though Walter Ulbricht, by grace of Soviet tanks,
B02 0060  7    may be head man in East Germany, that does not give
B02 0070  6    him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin
B02 0080  3    or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.
B02 0100  1       The wartime protocol of September 12, 1944, designated
B02 0100  9    a special "Greater Berlin" area, comprising the entire
B02 0110  6    city, to be under joint occupation. It was not a part
B02 0120  7    of any one of the three (later four) zones for occupation
B02 0130  4    by Soviet, American, British, and French troops respectively.
B02 0140  2    After the Berlin blockade and airlift, the Council
B02 0150  1    of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose "to
B02 0150 10    mitigate the effects of the present administrative
B02 0160  6    division of Germany and of Berlin".
B02 0170  1       For some time the Communists honored the distinction
B02 0180  1    between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector
B02 0180 11    of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the
B02 0190  8    two areas. Then they moved offices of the East German
B02 0200  6    puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally
B02 0210  4    to treat it as the capital of East Germany.
B02 0220  1       That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West
B02 0220 11    Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western
B02 0230  6    governments appears in notes which Britain, France,
B02 0240  2    and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's
B02 0250  1    gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer
B02 0250  9    and other West German officials to West Berlin. The
B02 0260  8    Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had
B02 0270  7    in East Berlin- and was certainly less provocative
B02 0280  3    than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler.
B02 0290  2       The British and other replies to that Moscow note
B02 0300  1    pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities "to
B02 0300  9    integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating
B02 0310  7    it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital
B02 0320  6    of East Germany". They insisted on the "fundamental
B02 0330  3    fact" that "the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite
B02 0340  1    status".
B02 0340  2       This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those
B02 0350  2    efforts as an accomplished fact. There remains, of
B02 0350 10    course, the question of what the West can do beyond
B02 0360  9    diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from
B02 0370  5    becoming accomplished facts.
B02 0370  8       One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades
B02 0380  7    of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist
B02 0390  6    "vopos" try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents.
B02 0400  3    Another remained when an American Army car was recovered
B02 0410  2    but with a broken glass. The glass may seem trivial
B02 0410 12    but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents
B02 0420  7    unless they are redressed.
B02 0430  1       Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and
B02 0430 10    the West German misgivings about "salami" tactics,
B02 0440  7    it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay
B02 0450  6    to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative
B02 0460  2    will mark a stiffening of response not only to future
B02 0470  1    indignities and aggressions but also to some that have
B02 0470 10    passed.
B02 0480  1    #PRAIRIE NATIONAL PARK#
B02 0480  3    Thousands of buffalo ("bison" they will never be to
B02 0490  4    the man on the street) grazing like a mobile brown
B02 0490 14    throw-rug upon the rolling, dusty-green grassland.
B02 0500  7    A horizon even and seamless, binding the vast sun-bleached
B02 0510  6    dome of sky to earth.
B02 0510 11       That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly
B02 0520  9    fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest
B02 0530  7    of the American continent as any later cinema image
B02 0540  4    of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.
B02 0550  1    For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken
B02 0550 11    and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a
B02 0560  9    whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that
B02 0570  5    was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and
B02 0580  3    Mississippi valleys began to fill.
B02 0580  8       The National Park Service now proposes to preserve
B02 0590  7    an area in Pottawatomie County, northeast Kansas, as
B02 0600  4    a "Prairie National Park". There the buffalo would
B02 0610  3    roam, to be seen as a tapestry, not as moth-eaten zoo
B02 0620  1    specimens. Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth
B02 0620 10    would be saved. Grasslands would extend, unfenced,
B02 0630  5    unplowed, unbroken by silo or barn- as the first settlers
B02 0640  7    saw them.
B02 0640  9       The Park Service makes an impressive ecological
B02 0650  4    and statistical case for creating this new park. American
B02 0660  2    history should clinch the case when Congress is asked
B02 0660 11    to approve.
B02 0670  2    #WHISKY ON THE AIR#
B02 0670  6    A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the
B02 0680  3    customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising
B02 0690  1    on TV and radio. Starting with small stations not
B02 0690 10    members of the National Association of Broadcasters,
B02 0700  6    the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor
B02 0710  7    barriers in major-market stations.
B02 0720  1       Probably the best answer to this kind of entering
B02 0720 10    wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal
B02 0730  5    Communications Commission to ban such advertising through
B02 0740  6    its licensing power.
B02 0740  9       The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically
B02 0750  6    bars hard-liquor commercials. Past polls of public
B02 0760  6    opinion show popular favor for this policy. Even the
B02 0770  4    Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific
B02 0780  1    prohibition.
B02 0780  2       Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and some
B02 0790  2    state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek
B02 0790 12    congressional action? Simply because the subverting
B02 0800  6    action of firms that are not members of the Distilled
B02 0810  6    Spirits Institute and of radio and TV stations that
B02 0820  3    are not members of the NAB tends to spread.
B02 0830  1       Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless
B02 0830 10    will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise
B02 0840  9    they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code
B02 0850  7    competitors.
B02 0850  8       Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or
B02 0860  6    other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous
B02 0870  4    than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks
B02 0880  3    are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference
B02 0890  1    between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola
B02 0890  9    and gulling him into downing bourbon.
B02 0900  4       A law is needed.
B02 0900  8    #NEW YORK: DEMOCRATS' CHOICE#
B02 0910  2    Registered Democrats in New York City this year have
B02 0920  1    the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for
B02 0920  9    Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will
B02 0930  9    run their party organization.
B02 0940  1       In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may
B02 0940 10    have found some pertinent points in what each faction
B02 0950  8    has said about the other.
B02 0960  1       Mayor Robert F. Wagner must, as his opponents demand,
B02 0960 10    assume responsibility for his performance in office.
B02 0970  7    While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal
B02 0980  7    ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems
B02 0990  2    in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies.
B02 0990 10    The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against
B02 1000  9    his own record.
B02 1010  1       State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand,
B02 1010  9    cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the
B02 1020  9    candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have
B02 1030  6    shown livelier interest in political power than in
B02 1040  2    the city's welfare. They, too, have links with the
B02 1040 11    city's ills.
B02 1050  2       Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.
B02 1050 12    Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more
B02 1060  7    mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left
B02 1070  8    an impression of quiet competence in his more protected
B02 1080  5    state post.
B02 1080  7       As Mayor, Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent
B02 1090  8    than some of his leading supporters would like. His
B02 1100  4    election, on the other hand, would unquestionably strengthen
B02 1110  2    the "regulars".
B02 1110  4       Mr. Wagner might or might not be a "new" Mayor in
B02 1120  7    this third term, now that he is free of the pressure
B02 1130  3    of those party leaders whom he calls "bosses". These
B02 1140  1    are, of course, the same people whose support he has
B02 1140 11    only now rejected to seek the independent vote.
B02 1150  6       But his reelection would strengthen the liberal
B02 1160  3    Democrats and the labor unions who back him.
B02 1170  1       If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats
B02 1170 11    may wish, it nevertheless must be made. The vote still
B02 1180  9    gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government
B02 1190  7    and their party.
B02 1200  1    #LITTLE WAR, BIG TEST#
B02 1200  5    Both Mr. K's have so far continued to speak softly
B02 1210  4    and carry big sticks over Laos.
B02 1210 10       President Kennedy, already two quiet demands down,
B02 1220  7    still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering
B02 1230  5    a public ultimatum to Moscow. But at the same time
B02 1240  2    he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an
B02 1240 11    hour of the fighting. And Secretary Rusk, en route
B02 1250  7    to Bangkok, doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements
B02 1260  6    for the possible entry of Australian or Thai SEATO
B02 1270  4    forces.
B02 1270  5       For Mr. Kennedy, speaking softly and carrying a
B02 1280  5    sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation.
B02 1290  2    The new President is in no position to start out his
B02 1290 13    dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs. He
B02 1300  8    must show at the outset that he means exactly what
B02 1310  6    he says.
B02 1310  8       In this case he has put the alternatives clearly
B02 1320  4    to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time. At his press
B02 1330  3    conference Mr. Kennedy said, "All we want in Laos is
B02 1340  2    peace not war ... a truly neutral government not a
B02 1340 12    cold war pawn". At the scene he has just as clearly
B02 1350  9    shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready
B02 1360  4    position.
B02 1360  5       Since Laos is of no more purely military value to
B02 1370  4    Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this approach
B02 1380  2    might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the
B02 1380 12    moment. But because of the peculiar nature of the military
B02 1390 10    situation in Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted
B02 1400  8    to let things ride- a course that would appear to cost
B02 1410  6    him little on the spot, but would bog Washington in
B02 1420  2    a tactical mess.
B02 1420  5       As wars go, Laos is an extremely little one. Casualties
B02 1430  4    have been running about a dozen men a day. The hard
B02 1440  2    core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only
B02 1440 11    some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters. But
B02 1450  7    for the United States and its SEATO allies to attempt
B02 1460  6    to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested government
B02 1470  2    army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp
B02 1480  1    terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.
B02 1490  1       But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev
B02 1490 10    the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment
B02 1500  7    from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest,
B02 1510  2    it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are
B02 1520  3    ready to attempt it- plus the fact that Moscow has
B02 1520 13    something to lose from closing off disarmament and
B02 1530  8    other bigger negotiations with Washington.
B02 1540  3       Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief
B02 1550  2    Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos
B02 1560  1    aim of the President. Actually it would be more accurate
B02 1560 11    to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung
B02 1570  9    fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve
B02 1580  6    a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table.
B02 1590  2       It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle
B02 1600  1    so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as
B02 1600 12    unreasonable. The State Department tacitly rejected
B02 1610  6    the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of
B02 1620  5    1954, and last year Washington backed the rightist
B02 1630  2    coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.
B02 1640  1       But since last fall the United States has been moving
B02 1640 10    toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to
B02 1650  7    back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by
B02 1660  3    outside observers and followed by a conference of interested
B02 1670  2    powers.
B02 1670  3       The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof Laos
B02 1680  2    is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's
B02 1680 12    terrain. But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and
B02 1690  9    for the sake of the Laotian people- who would not be
B02 1700  7    well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged
B02 1710  3    in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that
B02 1720  1    country from the cold war had to be made. The world
B02 1720 12    awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives.
B02 1730  4    #A VOTE FOR EDUCATIONAL TV#
B02 1740  1    The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally
B02 1740 10    controlled educational TV efforts should be emulated
B02 1750  7    in the lower house.
B02 1760  2       Twice previously the Senate has approved measures
B02 1760  9    backing ETV and the House has let them die. But this
B02 1770 11    year prospects may be better. The House communications
B02 1780  7    subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill
B02 1790  6    calling for the states to match federal funds.
B02 1800  1       This year's Senate measure would provide each state
B02 1800  9    and the District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be
B02 1810  8    used in support of private, state, or municipal ETV
B02 1820  5    efforts. The funds would be used for equipment, not
B02 1830  4    for land, buildings, or operation.
B02 1830  9       The relatively few communities that have educational
B02 1840  6    stations have found them of considerable value. But,
B02 1850  5    lacking money from commercial sponsors, the stations
B02 1855  2    have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving
B02 1860  6    their service. Other communities- the ones to be aided
B02 1870  8    most by the Senate bill- have had difficulty starting
B02 1880  7    such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment.
