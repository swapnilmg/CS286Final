E28 0010  1    MARKETING in the new decade will be no picnic- for
E28 0010 11    the sixties will present possibly the most intense
E28 0020  7    competitive activity that you have experienced in the
E28 0030  5    last 20-25 yr.
E28 0030  9       Why? Companies of all types have made great advances
E28 0040  7    in production capabilities and efficiencies- in modern
E28 0050  5    equipment and new processes, enlarged R+D facilities,
E28 0060  2    faster new product development. Many companies have
E28 0060  9    upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling,
E28 0070  8    distribution, and promotion techniques to gain a bigger
E28 0080  6    competitive edge.
E28 0080  8       Given this kind of business climate, what competitive
E28 0090  7    marketing problems will your company face in the next
E28 0100  6    10 yr.? Based on our experience with clients, we see
E28 0110  4    14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-
E28 0120  3    the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing
E28 0120 11    management.
E28 0130  1    #1. PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET#
E28 0140  1    _@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS._
E28 0140  1       There has been an intensification of price-consciousness
E28 0140  9    in recent years; there is every indication it will
E28 0150  8    continue. Frequently, wittingly or unwittingly,
E28 0160  3    price-consciousness
E28 0160  5    has been fostered by manufacturers, distributors, and
E28 0170  3    dealers. Despite generally good levels of income, we
E28 0180  3    see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling
E28 0190  1    back along the chain from consumer to distributor to
E28 0190 10    manufacturer.
E28 0200  1       Here are some key areas to examine to make sure
E28 0200 11    your pricing strategy will be on target:
E28 0210  5       Has the probable price situation in your field been
E28 0220  4    forecast as a basis for future planning? Have cost
E28 0230  1    studies been made of every phase of your operation
E28 0230 10    to determine what might be done if things get worse?
E28 0240  7    Have you actually checked out (not just mentally tested)
E28 0250  4    different selling approaches designed to counter the
E28 0260  2    price competition problem?
E28 0270  1    _@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION._
E28 0270  1       Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated
E28 0270  7    regarding product and advertising claims, partly because
E28 0280  7    of widespread criticism of such assertions. This problem
E28 0290  6    can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds
E28 0300  4    of businesses. Have you examined this problem of increasing
E28 0310  2    consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your
E28 0310  9    own company?
E28 0320  1    _@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES._
E28 0320  6       Need for service is here to stay- and the problem
E28 0330  6    is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties. There
E28 0340  3    are two reasons for this. First, most products tend
E28 0340 12    to become more complex. Second, in a competitive market,
E28 0350  9    the customer feels his weight and throws it around.
E28 0360  8       Providing good customer service requires as thorough
E28 0370  5    a marketing and general management planning job as
E28 0380  3    the original selling of the product. Too often it is
E28 0390  1    thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.
E28 0390 11       Good service starts with product design and planning:
E28 0400  8    Many products seem to be designed for a production
E28 0410  7    economy, not for a service one. Proper follow-through
E28 0420  3    requires training your own sales organization, and
E28 0430  1    your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques
E28 0430  9    but also in good customer relations.
E28 0440  5       Have you assessed the importance of service and
E28 0450  3    given it proper attention?
E28 0460  1    _@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS._
E28 0460  4       In spending his money today, the consumer is pulled
E28 0470  2    in many directions. To the manufacturer of the more
E28 0470 11    convenient-type product- the purchase of which can
E28 0480  6    be switched, delayed, or put off entirely- the implications
E28 0490  6    are important. Your competition is now proportionately
E28 0500  4    greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers
E28 0510  1    in the same field but also against a vast array of
E28 0510 12    manufacturers of other appealing consumer products.
E28 0520  6       Many industry trade associations are developing
E28 0530  4    campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's
E28 0540  4    dollar being spent on their particular products. Has
E28 0550  2    your company thought through its strategy in this whole
E28 0550 11    "discretionary buying" area?
E28 0560  3    _@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS._
E28 0570  1       The trends have been in evidence for many years-
E28 0570 10    population shifts to the Southwest and Far West, and
E28 0580  8    from city to suburbs. These shifts will continue in
E28 0590  4    the next 10 yr. Have you considered the implications
E28 0600  1    of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force
E28 0600 10    allocation, strength of distributor organizations,
E28 0610  5    and even plant location?
E28 0620  1    _@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS._
E28 0630  1       We have already witnessed great changes through
E28 0630  7    mergers and acquisitions in the food industry- at both
E28 0640  7    the manufacturing and retail ends. Instead of relatively
E28 0650  4    small sales to many accounts, there are now larger
E28 0660  1    sales to or through fewer accounts.
E28 0660  7       The change may require different products, pricing,
E28 0670  4    packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising and
E28 0680  2    executive attention- practically every link in the
E28 0680  9    marketing network may have to be adjusted. Have you
E28 0690  9    examined these trends, forecast the effects, and planned
E28 0700  6    your marketing strategy to compete effectively under
E28 0710  3    changing circumstances?
E28 0710  5    #2. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING METHODS#
E28 0720  2    _@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION._
E28 0720  7       In the area of private label competition, it is
E28 0730  7    logical to expect a continuation of trends which have
E28 0740  4    been under way during the first decade. As mass dealer
E28 0750  1    and distributor organizations grow in size, there is
E28 0750  9    every reason to expect them to try to share in the
E28 0760 10    manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits-
E28 0770  3    which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands
E28 0780  2    tends to do.
E28 0780  5       Average manufacturer frequently has helped build
E28 0790  3    private brand business, delivering largely the same
E28 0790 10    qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as
E28 0800  8    in branded. Moreover, the larger and more aggressive
E28 0810  6    mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted
E28 0820  4    on high quality- and the customer seems to have caught
E28 0830  2    on.
E28 0830  3       If you are up against private brand competition,
E28 0840  1    have you formulated a long-term program for researching
E28 0840 10    and strengthening your market position? If private
E28 0850  6    brand competition hasn't been felt in your product
E28 0860  5    field as yet, have you thought how you will cope with
E28 0870  2    it if and when it does appear?
E28 0880  1    _@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP._
E28 0880  1       Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through
E28 0880  8    advertising and promotion, will continue to make strides
E28 0890  8    in the sixties. It has multiple implications and possible
E28 0900  6    headaches for your marketing program.
E28 0910  1       How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of
E28 0910 12    outlet and still maintain relationships with older
E28 0920  7    existing outlets which are still important? If you
E28 0930  5    have a higher-quality product, how can you make it
E28 0940  3    stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken
E28 0950  1    word? Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different
E28 0950 10    brand of salesmanship.
E28 0960  3       Have you carefully examined the selling techniques
E28 0970  1    which best suit your products? Have you studied the
E28 0970 10    caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in
E28 0980  9    relation to requirements for effective marketing? Are
E28 0990  5    you experimenting with different selling slants in
E28 1000  3    developing new customers?
E28 1010  1    _@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY._
E28 1010  2       Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive
E28 1020  1    pressure, some by the fact that the customers have
E28 1020 10    come to expect certain niceties and flourishes. No
E28 1030  6    manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out
E28 1040  4    the costs involved.
E28 1040  7       The use of bulk handling is continuously growing.
E28 1050  5    Computers are being used to keep branch inventories
E28 1060  2    at more workable levels. "Selective selling"- concentrating
E28 1080  2    sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively
E28 1090  1    by some manufacturers.
E28 1090  4       There may be possible economies at any one of a
E28 1100  4    number of links in your marketing and distribution
E28 1100 12    chain. Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these
E28 1110  9    links regularly and carefully- and with some imagination?
E28 1120  7    In your sales force, will a smaller number of higher-priced,
E28 1130  6    high-quality salesmen serve you best, or can you make
E28 1140  5    out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?
E28 1150  1       Will your trade customers settle for less attention
E28 1150  9    and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can
E28 1160 10    share? In one company covering the country with a high-quality
E28 1170  8    sales force of 10 men, the president personally phones
E28 1180  4    each major account every 6 mos. As a result, distribution
E28 1190  3    costs were cut, customer relations improved.
E28 1200  1       Distribution costs are almost bound to increase
E28 1200  8    in the sixties- and you will never know what you can
E28 1210  9    do to control them unless you study each element and
E28 1220  4    experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.
E28 1230  1    _@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION._
E28 1230  8       From the manufacturer's point of view, the increasing
E28 1240  6    cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem
E28 1250  6    to be faced in the sixties. It is accentuated by the
E28 1260  3    need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.
E28 1270  1       How much fundamental thinking and research has your
E28 1270  9    company done on its advertising program? Are you following
E28 1280  9    competition willy-nilly- trying to match dollar for
E28 1290  8    dollar- or are you experimenting with new means for
E28 1300  5    reaching and influencing consumers? Have you evaluated
E28 1310  2    the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion
E28 1320  1    in your total marketing program- from the standpoint
E28 1320  9    of effort, money, and effectiveness?
E28 1340  1    _@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT._
E28 1340  1       Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting
E28 1340  8    products on the horizon. Will you be out in the market
E28 1350 11    place with some of these sales-building new products?
E28 1360  5       If competition beats you to it, this exciting new
E28 1370  4    product era can have real headaches in store. On the
E28 1380  2    other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product
E28 1380 11    and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive.
E28 1390  8    As markets become larger and marketing more complex,
E28 1400  5    the costs of an error become progressively larger.
E28 1410  2       Is your R+D or product development program tuned
E28 1420  1    in to the commercial realities of the market? Are there
E28 1420 11    regular communications from the field, or meetings
E28 1430  6    of sales and marketing personnel with R+D people?
E28 1440  4    Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing, but it's
E28 1450  3    useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register.
E28 1460  1       Are there individuals in your organization who can
E28 1460  9    shepherd a new product through to commercialization;
E28 1470  7    who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume,
E28 1480  5    production, and distribution costs; and translate the
E28 1500  3    whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures
E28 1500 12    which management can act on with some assurance? We
E28 1510  9    have seen good new products shelved because no one
E28 1520  6    had the assignment to develop such facts and plans-
E28 1530  3    and management couldn't make up its mind.
E28 1530 10    #3. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT#
E28 1550  1    _@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN._
E28 1550  1       There is a shortage of salesmen today. In the future,
E28 1550 11    quantitative demand will be greater because of the
E28 1560  8    expansion of the economy, and the qualitative need
E28 1570  4    will be greater still.
E28 1570  8       While many companies have done fine work in developing
E28 1580  7    sales personnel, much of it has been product rather
E28 1590  3    than sales training. Nor has the training been enough
E28 1600  1    in relation to the need. Most marketing people agree
E28 1600 10    it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future
E28 1610  8    requirements.
E28 1610  9       Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for
E28 1620  8    the future (both quantitatively and qualitatively)?
E28 1630  3    Has your company developed selection and training processes
E28 1640  3    that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen
E28 1650  1    you will need in the next 10 yr.?
E28 1660  1    _@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT TALENT._
E28 1660  2       With the growing complexity of markets and intensity
E28 1670  1    of competition, sales management, whether at the district,
E28 1670  9    region or headquarters level, is a tough job today-
E28 1680  8    and it will be tougher in the future. Men qualified
E28 1690  5    for the broader task of marketing manager are even
E28 1700  3    more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications
E28 1710  1    called for by this type of management work. The growth
E28 1710 11    of business has outdistanced the available supply,
E28 1720  6    and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in
E28 1730  5    the sixties.
E28 1730  7       Does your company have a program for selecting and
E28 1740  4    developing sales and marketing management personnel
E28 1750  1    for the longer term? Does your management climate and
E28 1750 10    your management compensation plan attract and keep
E28 1760  6    top-notch marketing people?
E28 1770  1    _@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING._
E28 1770  7       Every single problem touched on thus far is related
E28 1780  8    to good marketing planning. "Hip-pocket" tactics are
E28 1790  3    going to be harder to apply. Many food and beverage
E28 1800  2    companies are already on a highly planned basis. They
E28 1800 11    have to be. With greater investments in plant facilities,
E28 1810  9    with automation growing, you can't switch around, either
E28 1820  7    in volume or in product design, as much as was formerly
E28 1830  7    possible- or at least not as economically.
E28 1840  1       Are planning and strategy development emphasized
E28 1840  7    sufficiently in your company? We find too many sales
E28 1850  9    and marketing executives so burdened with detail that
E28 1860  6    they are short-changing planning.
E28 1870  1       Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your
E28 1870  8    management group to get the perspective of all individuals
E28 1880  9    and get everyone on the marketing team? Do you have
E28 1890  6    a long-term (5- or 10-yr.) marketing program?
E28 1900  2       The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in
E28 1900 11    defining your company's marketing problems realistically.
E28 1910  6    Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately
E28 1920  7    pinpoint your problems, whether they be in the market,
E28 1930  7    in marketing methods or in marketing management.
E28 1940  2       If companies will take the time to give objective
E28 1950  1    consideration to their major problems and to the questions
E28 1950 10    they provoke, then a long constructive step will have
E28 1960  8    been taken toward more effective marketing in next
E28 1970  4    decade.
