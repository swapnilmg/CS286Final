E27 0010  1    Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can
E27 0010  9    do and how and when to feed them can make a highly
E27 0020 11    competitive business more profitable for beef, dairy,
E27 0030  5    and sheep men.
E27 0030  8       The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which
E27 0040  7    additives do what. All the additives listed here are
E27 0050  4    sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration
E27 0060  1    of the federal government. All comments concerning
E27 0060  8    effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully
E27 0070  8    reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with FDA.
E27 0080  5       This article assumes that the rations you are feeding
E27 0090  5    your beef, dairy cattle, and sheep are adequately balanced
E27 0100  2    with protein, vitamins, and minerals.
E27 0100  7       The drug's chemical name is listed, since most states
E27 0110  8    require feed processors to use this name instead of
E27 0120  7    the trade name on the feed tag. In some instances,
E27 0130  1    the trade name is shown in parentheses following the
E27 0130 10    chemical name. This indicates that this drug is being
E27 0140  9    marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory
E27 0150  6    organizations have approved its use on the feed tag.

E27 0200  1    fed) of the early stages of shipping fever, prevents
E27 0200 10    or treats bacterial diarrhea, and aids in reducing
E27 0210  6    incidence of bloat and liver abscesses. Milk production
E27 0220  3    may be increased by the anti-infective properties of
E27 0230  2    this drug.
E27 0230  4    _HOW TO FEED: BEEF CATTLE (FINISHING RATION)_

E27 1610  6    #DRUG'S CHEMICAL NAME:#
E27 1610  9    Promazine hydrochloride
E27 1620  2    _WHAT IT DOES:_
E27 1620  5       A tranquilizer fed to cattle (other than lactating
E27 1630  3    dairy cows) prior to their being subjected to stress
E27 1640  1    conditions such as vaccinating, shipping, weaning calves,
E27 1640  8    and excessive handling.
E27 1650  2    _HOW TO FEED:_
E27 1650  5       Not less than .75 milligram but not more than 1.25
E27 1660  4    milligrams of additive per pound of body weight.
E27 1670  1    _CAUTION:_
E27 1670  1       Additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals
E27 1670 10    are slaughtered. There are three principal feed bunk
E27 1690  7    types for dairy and beef cattle: (1) Fence-line bunks-
E27 1700  5    cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from
E27 1710  5    the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;
E27 1720  1    (2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot,
E27 1720 10    are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface;
E27 1730  8    (3) Special bunks- as discussed here, they permit cattle
E27 1740  9    to eat from all sides. Feed is put in with an elevator.
E27 1750  6       Several materials or combinations of materials can
E27 1760  3    be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The
E27 1760 12    selection of materials depends on skills of available
E27 1770  8    labor for installation, cost of materials available
E27 1780  5    locally, and your own preference. No one material is
E27 1790  4    best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic
E27 1800  1    comparison is usually an individual problem.
E27 1800  7    #FENCE-LINE FEEDING.#
E27 1810  1    Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk
E27 1810 12    must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk. These
E27 1820  8    bunks also serve as a fence, so part of the additional
E27 1830  6    cost must be attributed to the fence. Because of their
E27 1840  3    location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks
E27 1840 14    are not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling
E27 1850 10    these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used
E27 1860  7    to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more
E27 1870  4    time and operations.
E27 1870  7       All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding
E27 1880  7    floor so access will be possible all year. This will
E27 1890  4    be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.
