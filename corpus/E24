E24 0010  1       The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American
E24 0010 11    gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they
E24 0020  9    were better. They were better trained, better looking,
E24 0030  5    better built, better disciplined ... and something
E24 0040  3    else- they were better dancers. Our athletes are only
E24 0050  2    just beginning to learn that they must study dance.
E24 0050 11    The Russians are all trained as dancers before they
E24 0060  8    start to study gymnastics.
E24 0070  1       But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really
E24 0070 11    important? After all, we did pretty well in some other
E24 0080 10    areas of the Olympics competition. But if it is important,
E24 0090  7    what can we do to improve ourselves? It is more than
E24 0100  5    just lack of dance training that is our problem, for
E24 0110  2    just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has
E24 0110 11    some very important things to learn from gymnastics.
E24 0120  7       Taking first things first, let's understand the
E24 0130  5    sport called gymnastics. It is made up of tumbling,
E24 0140  3    which might be said to start with a somersault, run
E24 0140 13    through such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels,
E24 0150  7    backbends, and culminate in nearly impossible combinations
E24 0160  6    of aerial flips and twists ... and apparatus work.
E24 0170  5    The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight
E24 0180  3    in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in
E24 0180 13    favor of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard,
E24 0190  9    horizontal bar, rings, and mats formerly in the school
E24 0200  8    gyms were replaced by baseball, volleyball, basketball
E24 0210  3    and football.
E24 0210  5       But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step
E24 0220  6    in training for all other sports because it provides
E24 0230  3    training in every basic quality except one, endurance.
E24 0230 11    The gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination,
E24 0240  7    timing, rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and
E24 0245  6    the desire for perfection. In short, gymnastics uses
E24 0250  5    every part of the body and requires a great deal of
E24 0270  3    character as well. The addition of endurance training
E24 0270 11    later, when the body is mature enough to benefit from
E24 0280 10    it without danger of injury, provides that final quality
E24 0290  5    that makes the top athlete, soldier or citizen.
E24 0300  3       Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that
E24 0310  1    it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising
E24 0310 11    teacher or parent could start training a healthy child
E24 0320  7    at the age of seven days. Most Europeans have been
E24 0330  5    exercising newborn infants for centuries.) In most
E24 0340  3    sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on
E24 0340 14    the side of those who begin young, and the Russian
E24 0350  9    competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training
E24 0360  6    behind him. The American is very lucky if he has three.
E24 0370  5       If a nation wished to get a head start in physical
E24 0380  2    fitness over all other nations, it would start its
E24 0380 11    kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the
E24 0390  8    day they entered and thus eliminate a large number
E24 0400  5    of the problems that plague American schools. First
E24 0410  2    of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional
E24 0410 11    tension, since action relieves both. Oddly enough,
E24 0420  7    it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty.
E24 0430  6    Certainly there would be less anxiety, fewer accidents
E24 0440  3    (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries),
E24 0450  1    and higher scholastic averages, since alert children
E24 0450  8    work better. Russia knows this, and that is why there
E24 0460  9    were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates
E24 0470  5    for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty thousand won
E24 0480  3    top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.
E24 0480 14    We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of
E24 0490 10    over 180 million people.
E24 0500  1       And what has dancing to do with all this? A great
E24 0500 12    deal. Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before
E24 0510  8    having the rigorous training on apparatus. Well-stretched,
E24 0520  6    trained in posture and coordinated movement, and wedded
E24 0530  4    to rhythm, they presented the audiences in Rome with
E24 0540  3    one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic
E24 0550  1    contest. American audiences in particular learned two
E24 0550  8    valuable lessons. They saw completely masculine and
E24 0560  6    obviously virile men performing with incredible grace.
E24 0570  4    They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing
E24 0590  3    the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats
E24 0590 10    requiring tremendous strength ... and with not one
E24 0600  8    bulging muscle.
E24 0610  1       President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically
E24 0610  9    fit nation. If we wait until children are in junior
E24 0620  8    high or high school, we will never manage it. To be
E24 0630  5    fit, one has to start early with young children, and
E24 0640  2    today the only person who really reaches such children
E24 0640 11    is the teacher of dance. If the dance teachers of America
E24 0650  9    make it their business to prepare their young charges
E24 0660  6    for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools
E24 0670  6    are really responsible, we will be that much ahead.
E24 0680  2    School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they
E24 0680 11    must do, will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters
E24 0690  8    who know how to do a headstand, and also how to help
E24 0700  8    other children learn it. They should know simple exercises
E24 0710  4    that could prepare less fortunate children for the
E24 0720  2    sports we will demand be taught.
E24 0720  8       Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's
E24 0730  4    request not only through their regular dance work,
E24 0740  3    but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that
E24 0740 13    makes for strength and flexibility.
E24 0750  5       Very little in today's living provides the strength
E24 0760  4    we need ... and nothing provides the flexibility. Dancers
E24 0770  2    do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop
E24 0780  1    real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength.
E24 0780  9    Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three
E24 0790 10    chin-ups and the results, considering the amount of
E24 0800  5    physical training they have had, will be very disappointing.
E24 0810  3    Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.
E24 0820  1    This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29
E24 0820 10    percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin
E24 0830 10    themselves once, and that English school girls outdo
E24 0840  6    them in almost every test (even dashes and endurance).
E24 0850  3    The only area in which American boys hold their own
E24 0860  1    is the baseball throw.
E24 0860  5    #THE CHINNING BAR#
E24 0860  8    For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended.
E24 0870  7    It should be installed over a door that is in full
E24 0880  7    view of everyone, and a chair should be placed under
E24 0890  2    it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin
E24 0890 13    themselves should be told to do one chin up each time
E24 0900 11    they pass under it. Those who are too weak, should
E24 0910  7    climb on the chair and, starting at the top of the
E24 0920  4    chin, let themselves slowly down. When they can take
E24 0930  1    ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have
E24 0930 10    the strength to chin up. Parents should be informed
E24 0940  7    about this system and encouraged to do the same with
E24 0950  6    the whole family at home.
E24 0950 11    #THE HORSE KICK#
E24 0960  1    Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength
E24 0960  9    will be aided with the Horse Kick. Start on hands and
E24 0970  8    feet. Keeping the hands in the starting position, run
E24 0980  5    in place to a quick rhythm. After this has become easy,
E24 0990  3    use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher.
E24 1000  1    Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room
E24 1000 11    to the other on all fours, kicking as high as possible.
E24 1010  8    #PUSH-UPS#
E24 1010 10    Push-ups are essential, but few have the strength for
E24 1020  8    them at first. Start on the knees in a large circle.
E24 1030  6    Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body
E24 1040  3    down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat.
E24 1040 14    Do this exercise six times each class period. As strength
E24 1050  9    improves start in a standing position with legs wide
E24 1060  7    apart and upper body bent forward. Start by falling
E24 1070  4    forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength
E24 1080  1    improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push
E24 1080 10    back to the stand position from the stretched position
E24 1090  6    without any intermediate pushes from the hands. The
E24 1100  5    push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top
E24 1110  2    of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body
E24 1110 13    down slowly, taking at least five seconds for the letting
E24 1120  9    down. Five of these done daily for about a week will
E24 1130  8    develop the strength for one push-up.
E24 1140  1    #HANDSTANDS#
E24 1140  2    Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders have
E24 1150  2    developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course
E24 1150 11    those who have developed more will find them easier.
E24 1160  9    Start with the class standing in a circle, with weight
E24 1170  7    on the right foot and the left extended a little way
E24 1180  4    into the circle. At first each child should do a kick
E24 1190  1    up by himself so that the teacher can determine those
E24 1190 11    ready to work alone, and those who need help. Drop
E24 1200  8    both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the
E24 1210  5    right foot up in back. The left will follow at once.
E24 1220  2    The right will land first, followed by the left. Return
E24 1220 12    to the standing position. Care should be taken to see
E24 1230  9    that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick
E24 1240  7    starts and also that the landing foot is brought as
E24 1250  4    close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat
E24 1260  1    falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such
E24 1260 11    work than any form of slipper. Eventually the class
E24 1270  7    will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher
E24 1280  5    can catch the leading leg. The child should then bring
E24 1290  3    both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten
E24 1290 12    the seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is
E24 1300 10    brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands
E24 1310  8    at a time.
E24 1310 11    #BACKBENDS#
E24 1310 12    The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of
E24 1320  9    free gymnastics, and, as with all acrobatics, the sooner
E24 1330  7    begun the better the results. Have the class lie supine
E24 1340  5    with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on either
E24 1350  2    side of the head a few inches away from the ears, fingers
E24 1350 14    pointing toward the shoulders. Arch the back upwards
E24 1360  8    to make a bridge. Be sure the head drops backward so
E24 1370  8    that the child looks at the floor rather than toward
E24 1380  4    the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will
E24 1390  1    move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.
E24 1390 11    Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide
E24 1400  8    a walkover.
E24 1400 10    #BACK CIRCLE#
E24 1410  1    To further increase back flexibility, work on the back
E24 1410 10    circle. Have the class lie prone. Place the hands in
E24 1420  9    front of the chest. Keep the legs straight and the
E24 1430  6    toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly, this arches
E24 1440  3    the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back
E24 1440 15    and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.
E24 1450 12    Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance
E24 1460  6    between toes and head.
E24 1460 10    #SOMERSAULTS#
E24 1470  1    The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program
E24 1470  9    is the somersault, or forward roll. This used to be
E24 1480  9    part of every child's bag of tricks, but few children
E24 1490  7    can do it today; some are actually incapable of rolling
E24 1500  4    forward and are completely confused when not sitting
E24 1510  1    or standing upright. For most small children, learning
E24 1510  9    a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another
E24 1520  9    child who can. After it has been seen, have the child
E24 1530  6    start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin, inexpensive
E24 1540  2    mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not
E24 1540 11    require falling). He places the hands on either side
E24 1550  9    of the head, keeping the chin down on the chest. He
E24 1560  8    then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides
E24 1570  4    it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient
E24 1580  1    for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight,
E24 1580 10    or afraid, more help will be needed. When the child
E24 1590  9    raises his seat into the air, the teacher takes hold
E24 1600  5    under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter what
E24 1610  2    happens, the child's performance will be controlled.
E24 1610  9    By lifting the seat upwards a little, the weight is
E24 1620  9    taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded.
E24 1630  6       These are beginnings, but correctly learned they
E24 1640  3    prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can
E24 1640 11    be performed by a strong, flexible body (we are not
E24 1650  9    talking of eccentric extremes). Even if gymnastics
E24 1660  4    are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler will be
E24 1670  3    a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being
E24 1670 13    with a greater margin of safety in any activity.
E24 1680  9       It is very important for parents to understand that
E24 1690  6    early training is imperative. And dancing school, so
E24 1700  3    helpful in artistic and psychological development,
E24 1700  9    also contributes to this essential early training-
E24 1710  7    and can contribute even more.
