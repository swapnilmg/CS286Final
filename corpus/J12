J12 0010  1    The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type
J12 0010 10    maintain a close relationship throughout. The pulmonary
J12 0020  5    vein, however, without the limiting supportive tissue
J12 0030  3    septa as in type I, follows a more direct path to
J12 0040  2    the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship
J12 0040 11    (figs. 8, 22). Another marked difference is noted here.
J12 0050  8    The pulmonary artery, in addition to supplying the
J12 0060  6    distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole, the alveolar
J12 0070  3    duct, and the alveoli, continues on and directly supplies
J12 0080  1    the thin pleura (fig. 8). The bronchial artery, except
J12 0080 10    for a small number of short branches in the hilum,
J12 0090  9    contributes none of the pleural blood supply. It does,
J12 0100  6    as in type I, supply the hilar lymph nodes, the pulmonary
J12 0110  4    artery, the pulmonary vein, the bronchi, and the bronchioles-
J12 0120  1    terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary
J12 0130  1    artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole.
J12 0130  9    No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were
J12 0140  4    noted in this group.
J12 0140  8       Lung type III (fig. 3) is to some degree a composite
J12 0150 11    of types I and II. It is characterized by the presence
J12 0160  9    of incompletely developed secondary lobules; well defined,
J12 0170  5    but haphazardly arranged, interlobular septa and a
J12 0180  4    thick, remarkably vascular pleura (fig. 9). The most
J12 0190  2    distal airways are similar to those found in type I,
J12 0190 12    being composed of numerous, apparently true terminal
J12 0200  7    bronchioles and occasional, poorly developed respiratory
J12 0210  4    bronchioles (figs. 14, 15). In this instance, because
J12 0220  3    of incomplete septation, the secondary lobule does
J12 0230  1    not constitute in itself what appears to be a small
J12 0230 11    individual lung as in type I. Air-drifts from one
J12 0240  9    area to another are, therefore, conceivable. Distally
J12 0250  3    the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery
J12 0260  1    on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other, as in
J12 0260 13    type I (fig. 24). This relationship, however, is
J12 0270  7    not maintained centrally. Here the pulmonary vein,
J12 0280  5    as in type II, is noted to draw away from the bronchus,
J12 0290  3    and to follow a more direct, independent course to
J12 0290 12    the hilum (figs. 23, 24). The bronchial artery in its
J12 0300 10    course and distribution differs somewhat from that
J12 0310  5    found in other mammals. As seen in types I and II,
J12 0320  5    it supplies the hilar lymph nodes, vasa vasorum to
J12 0330  2    the pulmonary artery and vein, the bronchi and the
J12 0330 11    terminal bronchioles. As in type I, it provides arterial
J12 0340  8    blood to the interlobular septa, and an extremely rich
J12 0350  6    anastomotic pleural supply is seen (figs. 9, 10). This
J12 0360  4    pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular
J12 0370  1    bronchial artery branches. Such a dual derivation was
J12 0370  9    strikingly demonstrated during the injection process
J12 0380  6    where initial filling would be noted to occur in several
J12 0390  8    isolated pleural vessels at once. Some of these were
J12 0400  4    obviously filling from interlobular branches of the
J12 0410  1    bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct
J12 0410  9    hilar branches following along the pleural surface.
J12 0420  6    With completion of filling, net-like anastomoses were
J12 0430  3    noted to be present between these separately derived
J12 0440  2    branches. An unusual increase in the number of bronchial
J12 0440 11    arteries present within the substance of the lung was
J12 0450  9    noted. This was accounted for primarily by the presence
J12 0460  6    of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary
J12 0470  3    artery. The diameter of this bronchial artery was much
J12 0480  2    too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum (figs. 16,
J12 0480 14    23, 24). In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth
J12 0490 10    to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery. This vessel
J12 0500  7    could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly
J12 0510  4    provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary
J12 0520  2    bed (figs. 17, 18). Also three other direct pathways
J12 0530  1    of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via
J12 0530  9    the pleura; through the interlobular septa; and along
J12 0540  7    the terminal bronchiole (figs. 14, 17, 18, 19). One
J12 0550  6    bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis
J12 0560  2    was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level (fig. 26).
J12 0570  1    #DISCUSSION#
J12 0570  2    It is evident that many marked and striking differences
J12 0580  1    exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison
J12 0580  9    is made. The significance of these differences has
J12 0590  6    not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding
J12 0600  3    physiologic differences been determined. However, the
J12 0610  2    dynamics of airflow, from morphologic considerations
J12 0610  8    alone, may conceivably be different in the monkey than
J12 0620  9    in the horse. The volume and, perhaps, even the characteristics
J12 0630  6    of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different
J12 0640  5    in the dog than in the horse. Also, interlobular air
J12 0650  2    drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably
J12 0650 12    occur in the horse much as in the human being; and,
J12 0660 11    in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree
J12 0670  6    on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent
J12 0680  4    (Van Allen and Lindskog, '31). A reason for such wide
J12 0690  4    variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking
J12 0700  1    at present.
J12 0700  3       Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function
J12 0710  1    and, if one is permitted to speculate, potential pathology
J12 0710 10    should be included in this statement as well. For example,
J12 0720 10    the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory
J12 0730  6    infection might be related to its delicate, long alveolar
J12 0740  4    ducts and short, large bronchioles situated within
J12 0750  2    a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive
J12 0750  9    tissue barriers such as those found in types I and
J12 0760 10    III. One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of
J12 0770  7    developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the
J12 0780  6    horse. In addition, it would be difficult to imagine
J12 0790  1    chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow, considering
J12 0790  9    its marked lobular development but, conversely, not
J12 0800  6    difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or
J12 0810  6    the dog.
J12 0810  8       Anatomically, the horse lung appears to be remarkably
J12 0820  5    like that of man, insofar as this can be ascertained
J12 0830  1    from comparison of our findings in the horse with those
J12 0830 11    of others (Birnbaum, '54) in the human being. The only
J12 0840 10    area in which one might find major disagreement in
J12 0850  7    this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution
J12 0860  2    of the bronchial arteries. As early as 1858, Le Fort
J12 0870  2    claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries
J12 0870 10    in human beings. In 1951, this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz.
J12 0880  9    The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest
J12 0890  9    support in the work of Miller ('50). Apparently, however,
J12 0900  4    Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and
J12 0910  5    cats, and he has been criticized for using pathologic
J12 0920  1    human material in his normal study (Loosli, '38). Although
J12 0920 10    Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural
J12 0930 10    blood supply existed between animals, nowhere in his
J12 0940  6    published works is it found that he did a comparative
J12 0950  4    study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian
J12 0960  1    lungs other than in the dog and cat (Miller, '13; '25).
J12 0970  1       The meaning of this variation in distribution of
J12 0970  9    the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear.
J12 0980 10    However, this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel
J12 0990  6    with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways
J12 1000  2    and supportive tissues of the lung. The alveoli and
J12 1000 11    respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues.
J12 1010  6    Theoretically, they are capable of extracting their
J12 1020  6    required oxygen either from the surrounding air (Ghoreyeb
J12 1030  3    and Karsner, '13) or from pulmonary arterial blood
J12 1040  2    (Comroe, '58). Therefore, an explanation of this alveolar
J12 1050  1    bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement
J12 1050  9    of an increased amount of supportive tissue, not primarily
J12 1060  7    diffusing in nature, in the region of the alveolus.
J12 1070  7    If this be true, the possibility exists that an occlusive
J12 1090  4    lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread
J12 1100  1    degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen
J12 1100  9    in generalized emphysema. One would not expect such
J12 1110  7    an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types
J12 1120  5    I or II.
J12 1120  8       The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary
J12 1130  5    artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch,
J12 1140  6    and thereafter by many others. Nakamura ('58), Verloop
J12 1150  3    ('48), Marchand, Gilroy and Watson ('50), von Hayek
J12 1160  2    ('53), and Tobin ('52) have all claimed their normal
J12 1160 11    but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human
J12 1170  7    being. Miller ('50) is the principal antagonist of
J12 1180  6    this viewpoint. In criticism of the latter's views,
J12 1190  2    his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection
J12 1190 10    studies in which all of the vascular channels were
J12 1200  9    first filled with a solution under pressure and then
J12 1210  5    were injected with various sized colored particles
J12 1220  2    designed to stop at the arteriolar level. As early
J12 1220 11    as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion
J12 1230  7    studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain
J12 1240  7    constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained
J12 1250  5    in the pulmonary artery and vein, but that increases
J12 1260  2    in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to
J12 1260 11    a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure. Berry,
J12 1270  7    Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed
J12 1280  8    this. Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary
J12 1290  4    artery anastomoses were demonstrated, were accomplished
J12 1300  3    by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure
J12 1310  1    on the pulmonary artery or vein, and then by injecting
J12 1310 11    the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards. It is distinctly
J12 1320  8    possible, therefore, that simultaneous pressures in
J12 1330  5    all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable
J12 1331  4    and hence, uninjectable. This viewpoint is further
J12 1340  1    supported by Verloop's ('48) demonstration of thickened
J12 1340  8    bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which
J12 1350  7    are capable of acting as valves. In other words, the
J12 1360  7    anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary
J12 1370  3    artery should be considered as functional or demand
J12 1380  1    shunts.
J12 1380  2       In addition, little work has been done on a comparative
J12 1390  1    basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial
J12 1390 10    artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses. Verloop ('48;
J12 1400  5    '49) found these shunts in the human being but was
J12 1410  7    unable to find them in rats. Ellis, Grindlay and Edwards
J12 1420  3    ('52) also were unable to find them in rats. Nakamura
J12 1430  1    ('58) was unable to demonstrate their existence, either
J12 1430  9    by anatomic or physiologic methods, in dogs. The possibility
J12 1440  8    that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent
J12 1460  9    is therefore inferred. Certainly, the mere fact of
J12 1470  6    failing to demonstrate them in one or another species
J12 1480  4    does not conclusively deny their existence in that
J12 1490  1    species. It is, however, highly suggestive and agrees
J12 1490  9    well with our own findings in which we also failed
J12 1500  7    to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary
J12 1510  4    artery shunts in certain species, especially the dog.
J12 1520  3       In conclusion, these findings suggest the need for
J12 1530  1    a comparative physiology, pathology, and histology
J12 1530  7    of mammalian lungs. In addition, a detailed interspecies
J12 1540  6    survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema
J12 1550  3    in mammals would be interesting and pertinent. Also,
J12 1560  2    for the present, great caution should be exercised
J12 1560 10    in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary
J12 1570  8    studies if they are to be applied to man. This is especially
J12 1580  8    so if the dog, cat or monkey are to be used, in view
J12 1590  6    of their marked anatomical differences from man. Finally,
J12 1600  2    it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung
J12 1600 12    may be anatomically more comparable to that of the
J12 1610  8    human than any other presently known species.
J12 1620  3    #SUMMARY#
J12 1620  4    The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs
J12 1630  4    of various mammals are presented. A tabulation of these
J12 1650  1    features permits the lungs to be grouped into three
J12 1650 10    distinctive subgross types. Type I is represented
J12 1660  6    by the cow, sheep, and pig; type II, by the dog, cat,
J12 1670  7    and monkey; type III, by the horse. Lobularity is extremely
J12 1680  4    well developed in type I; absent in type II; imperfectly
J12 1690  3    developed in type III. The pleura and interlobular
J12 1700  1    septa are thick in types I and III. The pleura is
J12 1700 12    extremely thin in type II and septa are absent. Arterial
J12 1710 10    supply to the pleura in types I and III is provided
J12 1720  8    by the bronchial artery, and in type II, by the pulmonary
J12 1730  7    artery. In types I, II and III the bronchial artery
J12 1740  4    terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with
J12 1750  2    the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole.
J12 1750 12    In type III the bronchial artery also provides blood
J12 1760  9    directly to the alveolar capillary bed. True terminal
J12 1770  6    bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by
J12 1780  4    the distal airways in types I and III, although small
J12 1790  2    numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles
J12 1790  8    are present. Well developed respiratory bronchioles,
J12 1800  5    on the other hand, appear to be the only form taken
J12 1810  7    by the distal airways in type II. In type I the
J12 1820  4    pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus
J12 1830  1    and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the
J12 1830 10    hilum. This maybe due to the heavy interlobular connective
J12 1840  7    tissue barriers present. In type III this general relationship
J12 1850  6    is maintained peripherally but not centrally where
J12 1860  4    the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path
J12 1870  1    to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in
J12 1870 12    type II.
