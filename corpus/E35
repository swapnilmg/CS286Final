E35 0010  1    #NEW RULE NO. 2: DON'T BUILD FROM THE OUTSIDE IN- TRY
E35 0010 12    TO BUILD FROM THE INSIDE OUT#
E35 0030  4    Don't insert your components into fixed openings, they
E35 0040  2    may or may not fit; position your components before
E35 0040 11    you close them in. For example:
E35 0050  5       Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall
E35 0060  5    cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker
E35 0070  1    and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets
E35 0070 11    and erect the end wall after they are all in place.
E35 0080 10       Set your bathtub before you close in the end of
E35 0090  7    the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb tub **f
E35 0100  5    through a narrow doorway.
E35 0100  9       Finish your plumbing before you frame it in (most
E35 0110  7    economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition
E35 0120  2    on either side of the pipes).
E35 0120  8       Finish installing and connecting up your furnace
E35 0130  5    and your water heater before you wall them in. There
E35 0140  3    is no better way to waste time than trying to install
E35 0140 14    a furnace in a finished **f closet.
E35 0150  7       Don't position your studs before you insert your
E35 0160  5    windows in conventional construction; that way you
E35 0170  2    may pay more to shim the window into place than you
E35 0170 13    paid for the window. You can save all that shimming
E35 0180  8    time if you set your windows in one, two, three order-
E35 0190  6    first the stud on one side, then the window, then the
E35 0200  3    stud on the other side.
E35 0200  8       Install your disappearing stair (or stairs) to the
E35 0210  6    attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall
E35 0220  3    the ceiling.
E35 0220  5       Don't close in your house until everything has been
E35 0230  3    carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall
E35 0240  1    between the house and garage. That way he can truck
E35 0240 11    his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof.
E35 0250  8       No auto maker would dream of putting the head on
E35 0260  7    the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block.
E35 0270  4    And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore
E35 0280  1    most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds
E35 0280  9    of dollars by always building from the inside out.
E35 0290  8    #NEW RULE NO. 3 RETHINK EVERYTHING TO GET ALL THE BIG
E35 0310  6    SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING OFFERS
E35 0320  2    YOU#
E35 0320  3    This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less
E35 0330  1    news of all, because ...
E35 0330  6    _1._
E35 0330  7       It makes it easy to handle much heavier units, so
E35 0340  3    you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier
E35 0340 13    prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures
E35 0350  8    alongside.
E35 0360  1    _2._
E35 0360  1       It makes materials handling the only construction
E35 0360  8    cost that (like earthmoving and roadbuilding) should
E35 0370  5    be lower today than in 1929.
E35 0380  1    _3._
E35 0380  1       It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and
E35 0380 11    where"? It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication
E35 0390 10    and increases the chance for shop fabrication, where
E35 0400  7    almost everything can be made better and cheaper.
E35 0410  4    _4._
E35 0410  5       It changes the answers on when to do what at the
E35 0420  3    site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways
E35 0420 12    last (as many builders do) you can now save money by
E35 0430 11    putting them in first. Instead of closing the house
E35 0440  6    in first (as most builders do) you can now cut your
E35 0450  4    costs by not closing it in until you have to (see p
E35 0460  1    121).
E35 0460  2    _5._
E35 0460  3       It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.
E35 0470  1    Not so long ago many builders were finding they could
E35 0470 11    cut their costs by "buying direct" and short-cutting
E35 0480  7    the dealer. But now many of these same builders are
E35 0490  5    finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up
E35 0500  2    with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most
E35 0500 13    efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything
E35 0510  4    just where it is needed- drywall inside the house,
E35 0520  7    siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, roofing
E35 0530  2    on the roof, etc.
E35 0530  6       Says Clarence Thompson: "We dealers must earn our
E35 0540  5    mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper
E35 0550  2    than he could do it himself". The revolution now under
E35 0560  1    way in materials handling makes this much easier.
E35 0570  1    _THE REVOLUTION IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS
E35 0570  9    TO BE DONE_
E35 0570 12       Five years ago a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored
E35 0580  8    by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily:
E35 0590  5       "Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle
E35 0600  8    unit loads; only one box car in eight has the wide
E35 0610  6    doors needed for unit loads; only one producer in a
E35 0620  3    hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads;
E35 0620 12    only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive
E35 0630  8    unit loads.
E35 0630 10       "So from raw materials to finished erection the
E35 0640  8    costs of materials handling (most of it inefficient)
E35 0650  5    add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost
E35 0660  2    of housing".
E35 0660  4       "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table was the real starting
E35 0670  5    point for today's revolution in materials handling",
E35 0680  2    says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber
E35 0680 10    Dealers' Research Council. "It made our whole industry
E35 0690  8    recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between
E35 0700 10    manufacturer, carrier, equipment maker, dealer, and
E35 0710  4    builder, all working together to cut the cost of materials
E35 0720  3    handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working
E35 0730  1    almost single-handed on the problem".
E35 0740  1    _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND TODAY:_
E35 0740  2       _1._
E35 0740  3       Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater
E35 0750  1    primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of
E35 0750 11    this year's new houses are mechanized. There are few
E35 0760  7    areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped
E35 0770  5    to save him money by delivering everything at lower
E35 0780  3    cost just where his workmen will need it.
E35 0780 11    _2._
E35 0780 12       Practically all bulky housing products can now be
E35 0790  8    ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for
E35 0800  4    mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt shingles,
E35 0810  2    glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard,
E35 0810  9    gypsum wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation
E35 0820  6    sheathing, floor tile, acoustical tile, plaster base,
E35 0830  4    and asbestos shingles.
E35 0830  7    _3._
E35 0830  8       Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now
E35 0840  6    offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding
E35 0850  5    need. For some significant new items see the pictures.
E35 0860  4    _4._
E35 0860  5       More than 50% of all lumber is unitized; an NLRDA
E35 0870  3    survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap
E35 0880  2    their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these,
E35 0880  9    376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in
E35 0890  8    standard units, because they save enough on mechanized
E35 0900  5    carloading to offset their strapping cost. Most of
E35 0901  3    the others will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather
E35 0910  9    than lose a good customer. "With a 15,500-lb fork-lift,
E35 0920 10    dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box
E35 0930  7    cars for 30@/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload
E35 0940  7    loose lumber one piece at a time", says James Wright
E35 0950  3    of NLRDA.
E35 0950  5    _5._
E35 0950  6       Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed
E35 0960  4    on a standard unit for unitized shipments- 48'' wide
E35 0970  5    by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets 24''
E35 0980  2    wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy
E35 0980 12    to load as much as 48,000 bd ft (say 120,000 lb
E35 0990 11    in a 50' box car- much more than the average for loose-loaded
E35 1000  9    cars.
E35 1000 10    _6._
E35 1000 11       The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more
E35 1010  8    box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading
E35 1020  6    (a 21% increase while the total number of box cars
E35 1030  5    was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates
E35 1040  1    twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First
E35 1040 10    was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of
E35 1050  9    the load in excess of 40,000 lb; later came a 1961
E35 1060  6    cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere) of
E35 1070  2    7@/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads (which works out
E35 1070 11    to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in
E35 1080 11    excess of 70,000 lb).
E35 1090  2    _7._
E35 1090  3       More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars,
E35 1100  1    and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with
E35 1100 10    the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded
E35 1110  9    for at little at 5.4@/mbf. For long hauls these shipments
E35 1120  6    should be protected with water-proof paper. This costs
E35 1130  4    from 75@ to $2.30/mbf, but the cover can pay off if
E35 1140  4    the lumber is to be stored in the open.
E35 1150  1    _THESE CARRIERS CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER-
E35 1150  7    AND THE BUILDER_
E35 1150 10       Says NRLDA's James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers
E35 1160  6    that move material from the yard to the job site have
E35 1170  9    undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's
E35 1180  6    other equipment".
E35 1180  8       The reason: today's components and lumber packages
E35 1190  5    are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and
E35 1200  5    a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new type
E35 1210  2    of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the
E35 1210 11    lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man-
E35 1220  8    the driver- to unload it, and because it unloads in
E35 1230  7    a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost
E35 1240  4    of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because
E35 1240 13    it can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can
E35 1250  9    deliver it to the best spot (in some cases, right on
E35 1260  7    the roof or inside the house), and never takes any
E35 1270  3    of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.
E35 1280  1       Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of
E35 1280 10    the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization
E35 1300  7    of their materials handling in the coming two years.
E35 1310  6    And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles".
E35 1320  2    #NEW RULE NO. 4: RESTUDY WHAT YOUR MEN DO, TO HELP
E35 1330  3    THEM WASTE LESS OF THE TIME YOU PAY FOR#
E35 1330 12    Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted
E35 1340  9    because the job was not planned right, so the right
E35 1350  4    tools were not handy at the right place at the right
E35 1360  1    time, or the right materials were not delivered to
E35 1360 10    the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in
E35 1370  7    the right order for erection, or you bought cheap materials
E35 1380  4    that took too long to fit, or your workmen had to come
E35 1390  3    back twice to finish a job they could have done on
E35 1390 14    one trip.
E35 1400  1       Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt
E35 1410  1    of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000
E35 1410 11    per house as a result of the time-+-motion studies
E35 1420  8    now being completed on his operation by industrial
E35 1430  3    efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already
E35 1440  1    this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation
E35 1440 10    manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and
E35 1450  9    wasted motion.
E35 1450 11       Builder Eddie Carr of Washington, past president
E35 1460  7    of NAHB, cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by
E35 1470  6    adopting the "SCR masonry process" worked out after
E35 1480  4    careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural Clay
E35 1490  2    Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do
E35 1490  9    better work for less. A midwestern builder cut his
E35 1500  9    labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50
E35 1510  6    by adopting this same process, cut them another $7.50
E35 1520  2    to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot
E35 1520 13    100-brick packages. The SCR process, with its precision
E35 1530  8    corner-posts, its precision guide lines, its working
E35 1540  7    level scaffold, and its hand-level brick supply takes
E35 1550  4    eight manhours to get set, but once ready it makes
E35 1560  3    it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a
E35 1560 13    day. See page 156.
E35 1570  3       One good way to cut your labor waste is to make
E35 1580  1    sure you are using just the right number of men in
E35 1580 12    each crew. Reports Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on
E35 1590  7    the job, we found that two men- a carpenter and a helper-
E35 1600  8    can lay a floor faster than three. We found that three
E35 1610  4    men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall panels
E35 1620  2    or trusses more economically than four men- because
E35 1620 10    four men don't make two teams; they make one inefficient
E35 1630  9    three-men-and-a-helper team. We found that wherever
E35 1640  6    you can use two teams on a job, five men, not four,
E35 1650  5    is the magic number".
E35 1650  9       No house was ever built that could not have been
E35 1660  7    built better for less if the work had been better planned
E35 1670  4    and the work better scheduled.
E35 1670  9    #NEW RULE NO. 5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME
E35 1680  9    ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@ A STUD#
E35 1690  3    This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a
E35 1690 13    builder can commit.
E35 1700  3       Green lumber was all very well back in the days
E35 1710  1    of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to
E35 1710 11    swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the
E35 1720  9    gypsum. But now that all production builders build
E35 1730  3    with drywall and all smart builders build with panels,
E35 1740  1    green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.
E35 1740  9       Green studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less
E35 1750  9    than 3@ more. So if a green stud makes a carpenter
E35 1760  7    or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20
E35 1770  3    seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than
E35 1770 11    a dry stud.
