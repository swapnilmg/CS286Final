C12 0010  1       Radio is easily outdistancing television in its
C12 0010  8    strides to reach the minority listener. Lower costs
C12 0020  6    and a larger number of stations are the key factors
C12 0030  5    making such specialization possible.
C12 0030  9       The mushrooming of FM outlets, offering concerts
C12 0040  7    (both jazz and classical), lectures, and other special
C12 0050  5    events, is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount
C12 0060  4    of publicity.
C12 0060  6       Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting
C12 0070  3    operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners-
C12 0080  3    an audience which, in the United States, comprises
C12 0080 11    some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend
C12 0090  6    each year.
C12 0090  8       Of course, the nonwhite listener does his share
C12 0100  7    of television watching. He even buys a lot of the products
C12 0110  7    he sees advertised- despite the fact that the copy
C12 0120  3    makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely
C12 0120 13    use any but white models in commercials.
C12 0130  6       But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations,
C12 0140  5    plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers,
C12 0150  4    give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach
C12 0160  2    new prospects. It is estimated that more than 600 stations
C12 0170  1    (of a total of 3,400) do a significant amount of programing
C12 0170 12    for the Negro. At least 60 stations devote all of their
C12 0180 10    time to reaching this audience in about half of the
C12 0190  7    50 states.
C12 0190  9       These and other figures and comments have been reported
C12 0200  6    in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine, a trade
C12 0210  4    publication for radio and TV advertisers. For 10 years
C12 0220  3    Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and
C12 0220 13    characteristics of the Negro market and of successful
C12 0230  8    techniques for reaching this market through radio.
C12 0240  5       In the past 10 years, Sponsor observes, these trends
C12 0250  4    have become apparent:
C12 0250  7    _@_
C12 0250  8       Negro population in the U.S. has increased 25 per
C12 0260  8    cent while the white population was growing by 18 per
C12 0270  6    cent. "The forgotten 15 million"- as Sponsor tagged
C12 0280  3    the Negro market in its first survey- has become a
C12 0290  2    better-remembered 19 million.
C12 0290  6    _@_
C12 0290  7       Advertisers are changing their attitudes, both as
C12 0300  4    to the significance of this market and the ways of
C12 0310  2    speaking to it.
C12 0310  5    _@_
C12 0310  6       Stations programing to Negro listeners are having
C12 0320  3    to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising
C12 0320 14    educational, economic, and cultural levels. Futhermore,
C12 0330  6    the station which wants real prestige must lead or
C12 0340  7    participate in community improvement projects, not
C12 0350  3    simply serve on the air.
C12 0350  8       In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio
C12 0360  7    program hours has risen at least 15 per cent, and the
C12 0370  5    number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per
C12 0380  1    cent, according to a research man quoted by Sponsor.
C12 0380 10       A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed
C12 0390  8    to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are
C12 0400  7    sure will bring in more business.
C12 0410  1       The 1960 census underscored the explosive character
C12 0410  8    of the population growth. It also brought home proof
C12 0420  7    of something a casual observer might have missed: that
C12 0430  5    more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the
C12 0440  3    southeastern states. Also, the state with the largest
C12 0450  1    number of Negroes is New York- not in the South at
C12 0450 12    all.
C12 0460  1       In New York City, WLIB boasts "more community service
C12 0460  9    programs than any other Negro station" and "one of
C12 0470  9    the largest Negro news staffs in America". And WWRL's
C12 0480  7    colorful mobile unit, cruising predominately Negro
C12 0490  4    neighborhoods, is a frequent reminder of that station's
C12 0500  4    round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests. Recently,
C12 0510  2    WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases
C12 0520  1    of employment agency deceit. A half-dozen other stations
C12 0520 10    in the New York area also bid for attention of the
C12 0530  9    city's Negro population, up about 50 per cent in the
C12 0540  8    past decade.
C12 0540 10       In all big cities outside the South, and even in
C12 0550  6    small towns within the South, radio stations can be
C12 0560  3    found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro
C12 0560 13    listeners. The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro
C12 0570  6    network includes 360 affiliated stations, whose signals
C12 0580  6    reach more than half the total U.S. Negro population.
C12 0590  4       One question which inevitably crops up is whether
C12 0600  5    such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro
C12 0610  2    is moving into a fully integrated status.
C12 0610  9       Whatever the long-range impact of integration, the
C12 0620  7    owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know
C12 0630  4    they have an audience and that it is loyal. Advertisers
C12 0640  1    have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for
C12 0640 10    brand names they have heard on stations catering to
C12 0650  8    their special interests. And many advertisers have
C12 0660  5    been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc
C12 0670  2    jockey phrase the commercial in his own words, working
C12 0670 11    only from a fact sheet.
C12 0680  5       What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other
C12 0690  2    radio shows? Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular
C12 0700  1    Negro bands and singers; rhythm-and-blues mood music;
C12 0700 10    "race" music, folk songs and melodies, and gospel programs.
C12 0710  9    Furthermore, news and special presentations inform
C12 0720  5    the listener about groups, projects, and personalities
C12 0730  3    rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station. Advertising
C12 0740  1    copy frequently takes into account matters of special
C12 0740  9    Negro concern.
C12 0750  2       Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony
C12 0760  1    station group as saying that the Southern Negro is
C12 0760 10    becoming conscious of quality and and "does not wish
C12 0770  8    to be associated with radio which is any way degrading
C12 0780  6    to his race; he tends to shy away from the hooting
C12 0790  2    and hollering personalities that originally made Negro
C12 0790  9    radio programs famous".
C12 0800  3       The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently
C12 0810  2    summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of
C12 0810 12    KSAN, San Francisco:
C12 0820  3       "Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro
C12 0830  4    today, because it provides a direct and powerful mirror
C12 0840  2    in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions,
C12 0840 12    achievements and desires. It will continue to be important
C12 0850  9    as a means of orientation to the Negro, seeking to
C12 0860  6    become urbanized, as he tries to make adjustment to
C12 0870  3    the urban life. Negro radio is vitally necessary during
C12 0880  1    the process of assimilation".
C12 0890  1       Presentation of "The Life and Times of John Sloan"
C12 0890 10    in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current
C12 0900  9    nostalgia for human values in art.
C12 0910  4       Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large
C12 0920  1    and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow,
C12 0920  9    Helen Farr Sloan, to the Wilmington Society of the
C12 0930  8    Fine Arts, the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's
C12 0940  6    work. From early family portraits, painted before he
C12 0950  4    entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of
C12 0960  1    the Fine Arts, the chronology extends to a group of
C12 0960 11    paintings executed in his last year (1951) and still
C12 0970  8    part of his estate.
C12 0970 12       Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of
C12 0980 10    the period in which they lived. Few who have painted
C12 0990  6    the scenes around them have done so with so little
C12 1000  3    bitterness. The paintings, drawings, prints, and illustrations
C12 1010  1    all reflect the manners, costumes, and mores of America
C12 1010 10    in the first half of the present century.
C12 1020  6       Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by
C12 1030  4    his close friend Robert Henri. As early as 1928, however,
C12 1040  3    the Sloan style began to change. The dark pigments
C12 1040 12    of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette.
C12 1050 10    The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching
C12 1060  7    technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of
C12 1070  3    American genres in favor of single figure studies and
C12 1080  2    studio nudes.
C12 1080  4       The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided
C12 1090  3    art. In addition to the paintings are drawings, prints,
C12 1100  1    and illustrations. Sloan created such works for newspaper
C12 1100  9    supplements before syndication threw him out of a job
C12 1110  9    and sent him to roam the streets of New York, thereby
C12 1120  6    building for America an incomparable city survey from
C12 1130  4    paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines
C12 1140  1    on city roofs.
C12 1140  4       One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases
C12 1150  2    is "Sun and Wind on the Roof", with a woman and child
C12 1160  1    bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying
C12 1160  8    birds. Although there are landscapes in the show (one
C12 1170  8    of the strongest is a vista of "Gloucester Harbor"
C12 1180  3    in 1915), the human element was the compelling factor
C12 1190  2    in Sloan's art.
C12 1190  5       Significant are such canvases as "Bleeker Street,
C12 1200  3    Saturday Night", with its typically American crowd
C12 1210  2    (Sloan never went abroad); the multifigure "Traveling
C12 1210  9    Carnival", in which action is vivified by lighting;
C12 1220  8    or "Carmine Theater, 1912", the only canvas with an
C12 1230  8    ash can (and foraging dog), although Sloan was a member
C12 1240  6    of the famous "Eight", and of the so-called "Ash-Can
C12 1250  5    School", a term he resented.
C12 1250 10       Not all the paintings, however, are of cities. The
C12 1260  8    exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest
C12 1270  7    ("Koshare in the Dust", a vigorous Indian dance, and
C12 1280  4    landscapes suggest the influence of western color on
C12 1290  3    his palette).
C12 1290  5       The fact that Sloan was an extrovert, concerned
C12 1300  2    primarily with what he saw, adds greatly to the value
C12 1300 12    of his art as a human chronicle.
C12 1310  6       There are 151 items in the Wilmington show, including
C12 1320  3    one painting by each member of the "Eight", as well
C12 1330  3    as work by Sloan's friends and students. Supplementing
C12 1330 11    the actual art are memorabilia- correspondence, diaries,
C12 1340  7    books from the artist's library, etc. All belong to
C12 1350  7    the collection being given to Wilmington over a period
C12 1360  6    of years by Mrs. Sloan, who has cherished such revelatory
C12 1370  3    items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the
C12 1380  2    Art Students League, New York, in the 1920's.
C12 1380 10       To enable students and the public to spot Sloan
C12 1390  9    forgeries, the Delaware Art Center (according to its
C12 1400  6    director, Bruce St. John) will maintain a complete
C12 1410  3    file of photographs of all Sloan works, as well as
C12 1420  1    a card index file. The entire Sloan collection will
C12 1420 10    be made available at the center to all serious art
C12 1430  8    students and historians.
C12 1430 11       The current exhibition, which remains on view through
C12 1440  8    Oct. 29, has tapped 14 major collections and many private
C12 1450  7    sources.
C12 1460  1       Any musician playing Beethoven here, where Beethoven
C12 1460  8    was born, is likely to examine his own interpretations
C12 1470  8    with special care. In a sense, he is offering Bonn
C12 1480  7    what its famous son (who left as a youth) never did-
C12 1490  3    the sound of the composer's mature style.
C12 1490 10       Robert Riefling, who gave the only piano recital
C12 1500  8    of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival,
C12 1510  4    penetrated deep into the spirit of the style. His readings
C12 1520  3    were careful without being fussy, and they were authoritative
C12 1530  1    without being presumptuous. The 32 C minor Variations
C12 1540  1    with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from
C12 1540 10    one to another, leaving the right impression of abundance
C12 1550  7    under discipline.
C12 1560  1       The D minor Sonata, Op. 31 No. 2, introduced by
C12 1560 10    dynamically shaped arpeggios, was most engaging in
C12 1570  7    its moments of quasi-recitative- single lines in which
C12 1580  7    the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the
C12 1590  3    idea to come. These inwardly dramatic moments showed
C12 1590 11    the kind of "opera style" of which Beethoven was genuinely
C12 1600 10    capable, but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics
C12 1610 11    of staging.
C12 1620  1       Two late Sonatas, Op. 110 and 111, were played with
C12 1620 11    similar insight, the disarming simplicities of the
C12 1630  6    Op. 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious.
C12 1640  4    The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles
C12 1650  4    of Op. 126. Herr Riefling, in everything he gave his
C12 1660  3    large Beethoven Hall audience, proved himself as an
C12 1660 11    interpreter of unobtrusive authority.
C12 1670  4       Volker Wangenheim, who conducted Bonn's Sta^dtisches
C12 1680  1    Orchester on the following evening, made one more conscious
C12 1690  4    of the process of interpretation. Herr Wangenheim has
C12 1700  2    only recently become the city's music director, and
C12 1700 10    is a young man with a clear flair for the podium.
C12 1710  9       But he weighted the Eighth Symphony, at times, with
C12 1720  5    a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably
C12 1730  2    at odds with the music. He might have been hoping,
C12 1730 12    to all appearances, that this relatively sunny symphony,
C12 1740  7    in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of
C12 1750  9    the program, could amount to something like the Ninth;
C12 1760  6    but no amount of head-tossing could make it so.
C12 1770  4       The conductor's preoccupation with the business
C12 1780  1    of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness,
C12 1780  8    as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth
C12 1790  6    Piano Concerto, but when he put his deliberations and
C12 1800  4    obsequies aside and let the music move as designed,
C12 1810  1    it did so with plenty of spring.
C12 1810  8       The concerto's soloist, Hans Richter-Haaser, played
C12 1820  5    with compensatory ease and economy, though without
C12 1830  2    the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated
C12 1830 11    on the previous evening by Herr Riefling. His was a
C12 1840 10    burgomaster's Beethoven, solid and sensible.
C12 1850  5       Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous
C12 1860  4    sweepings of the Fantasy for Piano, Chorus, and Orchestra
C12 1870  3    in C minor, made up by its composer to fill out one
C12 1880  3    of his programs. The entrance of the Sta^dtisches Gesangverein
C12 1890  1    (Bonn's civic chorus) was worth all the waiting, however,
C12 1890 10    as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music
C12 1900  8    to life.
C12 1900 10       The last program of this festival, which during
C12 1910  8    two weeks had sampled most compositional categories,
C12 1920  3    brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and
C12 1930  2    Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance
C12 1940  1    of the Missa Solemnis.
