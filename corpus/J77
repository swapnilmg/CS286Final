J77 0010  1    Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained
J77 0010 10    at 85-90`F. (29-32`C.). The top rolls are loaded with
J77 0020  9    40 lbs. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs.
J77 0030  8    is adequate.
J77 0030 10       The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver
J77 0040 10    into the raised main drain pipe (thus returning suds
J77 0050  5    to soap box) and the machine is started. The 160-ml.
J77 0060  4    bath containing the calculated amount of detergent
J77 0060 11    is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen.
J77 0070  9    Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period
J77 0080  8    of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through
J77 0090  4    the squeeze rolls. At the conclusion of the washing,
J77 0100  1    8 liters of water at 90`F. (32`C.) are automatically
J77 0100 10    metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs,
J77 0110  9    4 liters to each tub. This operation requires from
J77 0120  5    10 to 12 minutes. During the rinsing operation the
J77 0130  3    volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow
J77 0140  1    from the main drain begins. At this point the drains
J77 0140 11    are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge
J77 0150  8    directly into the waste line and the main tub drain
J77 0160  6    is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge. When all
J77 0170  2    of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to
J77 0170 12    the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete
J77 0180  8    draining of the tubs. The run is complete when all
J77 0190  6    the water has drained off into the waste line.
J77 0200  1       By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages,
J77 0200  9    first by dilution until the time when the drains are
J77 0210 10    separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing
J77 0220  7    liquor by clean rinse water, since soiled liquor squeezed
J77 0230  4    from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste
J77 0240  3    from the suds box drains. This method of rinsing appears
J77 0250  1    to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition.
J77 0250  9    #SUGGESTED EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION#
J77 0260  4    Evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or
J77 0270  6    a grease-removal basis as desired. A reflectance-measuring
J77 0280  1    instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning, whereas
J77 0290  1    Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal.
J77 0300  1    #PURPOSE AND SCOPE#
J77 0300  4    This test method is intended for determining the dimensional
J77 0310  3    changes of woven or knitted fabrics, made of fibers
J77 0310 12    other than wool, to be expected when the cloth is subjected
J77 0320 11    to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial
J77 0330  7    laundry and the home. Four washing test procedures
J77 0340  4    are established, varying in severity from very severe
J77 0350  2    to very mild, and are intended to cover the range of
J77 0350 13    practical washing from commercial procedure to hand
J77 0360  7    washing. Five drying test procedures are established
J77 0370  4    to cover the range of drying techniques used in the
J77 0380  4    home and commercial laundry. Three methods for determining
J77 0390  1    the dimensional restorability characteristics are established
J77 0390  7    for those textiles which require restoration by ironing
J77 0400  7    or wearing after laundering. These tests are not accelerated
J77 0410  6    and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes
J77 0420  3    after repeated launderings.
J77 0420  6       Table I summarizes all of the various washing,
J77 0430  7    drying, and restoration procedures available. The person
J77 0440  4    using these tests must determine which combination
J77 0450  1    of procedures is practical for any specific item in
J77 0450 10    order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile
J77 0460  7    fabrics or garments after laundering procedures commonly
J77 0470  4    used in the home or commercial laundry. It is possible
J77 0480  4    to identify the test procedure completely with a code
J77 0490  1    consisting of a Roman Numeral, a letter, and an Arabic
J77 0490 11    number. For example Test III E 1 refers to a specimen
J77 0500 10    which has been washed by procedure "III" (at 160`F.
J77 0510  6    for a total of 60 minutes in the machine, has been
J77 0520  6    dried in a tumble dryer by procedure "E" and has been
J77 0530  4    subjected to restorative forces on the Tension Presser
J77 0540  2    by procedure "1".
J77 0540  5    #PRINCIPLE#
J77 0540  6    A specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing
J77 0550  7    wash wheel, dried and subjected to restorative forces
J77 0560  4    where necessary. Temperature and time of agitation
J77 0570  1    in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees
J77 0570 11    of severity. Drying procedures and application of restorative
J77 0580  7    force procedures are varied to conform with end-use
J77 0590  8    handling during home or commercial laundering. Distances
J77 0600  3    marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions
J77 0620  2    (or wales and courses for knitted fabrics) are measured
J77 0620 11    before and after laundering.
J77 0630  4    #APPARATUS AND MATERIALS#
J77 0640  1    _WASH WHEEL- CYLINDRICAL WASH WHEEL OF THE REVERSING
J77 0640  9    TYPE._
J77 0640 10       The wheel (cage) is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter
J77 0650  8    and 20 to 24 inches inside length. There are three
J77 0660  3    fins each approximately three inches wide extending
J77 0660 10    the full length of the inside of the wheel. One fin
J77 0670 10    is located every 120` around the inside diameter of
J77 0680  6    the wheel. The wash wheel rotates at a speed of 30
J77 0690  4    revolutions per minute, making five to ten revolutions
J77 0690 12    before reversing. The water inlets are large enough
J77 0700  8    to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level
J77 0710  7    in less than two minutes, and the outlet is large enough
J77 0720  4    to permit discharge of this same amount of water in
J77 0730  1    less than two minutes. The machine is equipped with
J77 0730 10    a pipe for injecting live steam that is capable of
J77 0740  7    raising the temperature of water at an eight-inch level
J77 0750  5    from 110` to 140`F. (38` to 60`C.) in less than two
J77 0760  4    minutes. The machine shall contain an opening for the
J77 0770  1    insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment
J77 0770  9    for determining the temperature of the water during
J77 0780  7    the washing and rinsing procedures. It is equipped
J77 0790  4    with an outside water gauge that will indicate the
J77 0800  1    level of the water in the wheel.
J77 0800  8       A domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent
J77 0810  5    results may be used. The wash wheel is the equipment
J77 0820  2    preferred for the test.
J77 0830  1    _PRESSING EQUIPMENT- FLAT-BED PRESS MEASURING 24 INCHES
J77 0830  5    BY 50 INCHES OR LARGER._
J77 0830 10       Any flat-bed press capable of pressing a specimen
J77 0840  6    22 inches square may be used as an alternative. The
J77 0850  3    flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less
J77 0860  1    than 275`F. (135`C.).
J77 0870  1    _DRYER- DRYER OF THE ROTARY TUMBLE TYPE, HAVING A CYLINDRICAL
J77 0880  1    BASKET APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 24 INCHES
J77 0890  1    IN LENGTH AND ROTATING AT APPROXIMATELY 35 R.P.M._
J77 0890  1       The dryer is provided with a means of maintaining
J77 0890 10    a drying temperature of 120`-160`F. (49`-71`C.), measured
J77 0900  7    in the exhaust vent as close as possible to the drying
J77 0910  9    chamber.

J77 1020  1       _FLATIRON, ELECTRIC- APPROXIMATELY 3 LB._
J77 1020  3       _TENSION PRESSER- CONSISTING OF A PADDED IRONING
J77 1030  1    BOARD FROM WHICH EXTEND CLAMPING MEMBERS ON ALL FOUR
J77 1030  9    SIDES._
J77 1030 10       Two of the clamps are fixed to the edges of the
J77 1040  9    board whereas two clamps travel on guide rails opposite
J77 1050  4    the fixed clamps. The movable clamps travel on carriages
J77 1060  2    which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading.
J77 1070  1    Sets of weights are provided so that the load can be
J77 1070 12    selected in the range of 1/2 to 4 pounds. A perforated
J77 1080  9    aluminum plate, used to provide the drying surface,
J77 1090  4    is heated by means of a flatiron. A special template
J77 1100  1    is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a
J77 1100 10    specimen for a central measuring area and the fabric
J77 1110  8    extensions to the clamps (see Fig. 2).
J77 1130  1    _KNIT SHRINKAGE GAUGE- CONSISTING OF A SET OF 20 MOUNTING
J77 1130  1    PINS SET IN GUIDES IN RADIAL SLOTS (FIG.1)._
J77 1130  9       Each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning
J77 1140  5    member which is driven outwardly in the slot. The springs
J77 1150  5    have an extension of 1 inch at **f tension. The tensioning
J77 1160  2    members have a common drive so that the application
J77 1160 11    of restorative force takes place simultaneously in
J77 1170  6    all directions in the plane of the test specimen. The
J77 1180  6    minimum diameter of the pin frame in the collapsed
J77 1190  2    state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the
J77 1190 12    freely extended state (unloaded) is 14 inches. The
J77 1200  8    surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen
J77 1210  7    is uncluttered and polished so as to be as friction-free
J77 1220  6    as possible.
J77 1220  8    #TEST SPECIMENS#
J77 1220 10    The preparation of test specimens will vary depending
J77 1230  7    upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure
J77 1240  3    (if any) to be used.
J77 1240  8       Three specimens for each sample to be tested are
J77 1250  8    required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average
J77 1260  2    of performance. This is especially true for knitted
J77 1270  1    fabrics.
J77 1270  2       Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium
J77 1270  9    with a standard atmosphere of **f and **f and then
J77 1280 10    laid out without tension on a flat, polished surface,
J77 1290  6    care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles
J77 1300  4    or creases. Fabrics that are badly distorted in their
J77 1310  1    unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give
J77 1310  9    deceptive dimensional change results when laundered
J77 1320  5    by any procedure. This also holds true if restorative
J77 1330  3    forces are applied. Therefore, it is recommended that
J77 1340  1    in such cases the sample be replaced, or if used, the
J77 1340 12    results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability
J77 1350  5    tests be considered as indicative only.
J77 1360  2       Generally, it is necessary to mark distances on
J77 1370  1    a specimen (or garment) in both lengthwise and widthwise
J77 1370 10    directions and to measure before and after laundering.
J77 1380  7    The distances may be marked with indelible ink and
J77 1390  5    a fine-point pen, by sewing fine threads into the fabric,
J77 1400  3    or by a specially designed stamping machine. The marked
J77 1400 12    distances are parallel to the respective yarns. Usually,
J77 1410  8    the greater the original distances marked, the greater
J77 1420  6    will be the accuracy of the test. Distances of less
J77 1430  5    than 10 inches are not recommended.
J77 1440  1    _WOVEN FABRICS TO BE DRIED BY PROCEDURE B (FLAT-BED
J77 1450  1    PRESSED) OR RESTORED BY PROCEDURE 3 (HAND IRONING):_
J77 1450  5       The specimen of fabric is a rectangle at least 22
J77 1460  4    by 22 inches, except for cloth narrower than 22 inches,
J77 1470  1    in which case the specimen is the entire width of the
J77 1470 12    fabric. Three distances, each at least 18 inches, are
J77 1480  8    measured and marked off parallel to each of the warp
J77 1490  6    and filling directions. The distances are at least
J77 1500  2    two inches from any edge of the specimen.
J77 1510  1    _WOVEN OR WARP KNITTED FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE
J77 1520  1    PROCEDURE 1 (TENSION PRESSER)._
J77 1520  1       Each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches.
J77 1520 11    Place the template (Fig. 2) on the fabric so that the
J77 1530  9    sides of the 10 inch square cut out of the template
J77 1540  6    are parallel to the warp and filling for woven fabrics,
J77 1560  2    or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics, and so
J77 1560 12    that the same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges
J77 1570  9    of the template on all sides. Mark the specimen at
J77 1580  6    the outer edges of the template with pen and indelible
J77 1590  3    ink; also place three dots on the specimen at each
J77 1600  1    side of the 10 inch square, one dot at midpoint, and
J77 1600 12    one at approximately 1/2 inch from each corner. Measure
J77 1610  7    and record.
J77 1620  1    _CIRCULAR KNITTED FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE
J77 1630  1    PROCEDURE 2, (KNIT SHRINKAGE GAUGE)._
J77 1630  2       Each specimen is approximately 16 inches square.
J77 1630  9    The markings consist of a centrally located 10 inch
J77 1640  8    diameter measuring circle and a 14 inch diameter circle
J77 1650  7    of 20 dots equidistantly spaced (See Figure 1).
J77 1660  3    _GARMENTS._
J77 1660  4       Critical measurements in length and width directions
J77 1670  2    should be taken before and after washing, drying, and
J77 1670 11    restorative procedures.
J77 1680  2    #PROCEDURE#
J77 1680  3    _WASHING-_
J77 1680  4       The washing procedures are summarized in Table II.
J77 1690  7       Place the specimen in the wash wheel with sufficient
J77 1700  7    other similar fabric to make a dry load of **f pounds.
J77 1710  5    Start the wash wheel and note the time. Immediately
J77 1720  1    add water at 100-105`F. (38-43`C.) to the wheel to
J77 1720 12    a level of **f inches; this level will be increased
J77 1730  9    by condensed steam. When this water level has been
J77 1740  7    reached, inject steam into the wheel until the temperature
J77 1750  3    reaches that shown in Column B of Table II. Add sufficient
J77 1760  3    soap (and softener if required to counteract hard water)
J77 1770  2    to furnish a good running suds, or if desired use a
J77 1770 13    synthetic detergent.
J77 1780  1    _TEST I_
J77 1780  3       - Stop the wash wheel at the end of the time shown
J77 1800  2    in Column A of Table II and drain. Refill the machine
J77 1810  1    to a level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F.
J77 1810 13    (38-43` C.) and start the machine. Inject steam, if
J77 1820  8    necessary, to reach the temperature shown in Column
J77 1830  5    D of Table II. Again stop the machine at the end
J77 1840  4    of the time shown in Column C of Table II. This procedure
J77 1850  3    is repeated for the second rinse, using the temperatures
J77 1860  1    and time shown in Columns F and E of Table II.
J77 1870  1    _TESTS II, III, AND IV._
J77 1870  3       - Run the machine continuously until completion
J77 1880  1    of the test. Drain off the soap solution of the suds
J77 1880 12    cycle at such a time that the wheel has become substantially
J77 1890  9    empty of soap and water at the end of the time shown
J77 1900  8    in Column A of Table II, measured from the time the
J77 1910  5    wash wheel was started. Refill the machine to a level
J77 1920  2    of **f inches with water at 100-109` F. (38-43` C.).
J77 1930  1    When this water level has been reached, inject steam
J77 1930 10    until the temperature is that shown in Column D. Drain
J77 1940  8    off the water at such a time that the wheel has become
J77 1950  6    substantially empty of water at the end of the sum
J77 1960  4    of the times shown in Columns A and C, measured from
J77 1970  1    the time the wash wheel was started. Immediately refill
J77 1970 10    to a level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F.
J77 1980 10    (38-43` C.). When this water level has been reached
J77 1990  7    inject steam until the temperature is that shown in
J77 2000  4    Column F. Drain off the water at such a time that
J77 2010  1    the wheel has become substantially empty of water at
J77 2010 10    the end of the sum of the times shown in Columns A,
J77 2020  9    C, and E, measured from the time the wash wheel was
J77 2030  7    started.
