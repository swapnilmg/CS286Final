P22 0010  2    I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield- that
P22 0010 12    Lucille was a husband stealer. You can't keep that
P22 0020  9    kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus.
P22 0030  8    And I've been told that just about every town, no matter
P22 0040  5    what its size, has its Lucille Warren.
P22 0050  1       Just as it has its Susan Dolan, though nobody'd
P22 0050 10    ever bothered to tell me that. Susan Dolan, that's
P22 0060  7    me.
P22 0060  8       They even talked about Lucille down at the Young
P22 0070  6    Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible
P22 0080  7    classes and helping out with the office work for our
P22 0090  3    foreign mission. I never heard my folks talk about
P22 0090 12    her, though. They were good-living religious people,
P22 0100  7    and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread
P22 0110  6    any gossip about anybody. Even if they ever did say
P22 0120  3    anything about people like Lucille Warren, I know they
P22 0120 12    wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me.
P22 0130 10    My folks and my faith protected me from things like
P22 0140  6    that.
P22 0140  7       And so I was really upset the first time I discovered
P22 0150  6    that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. warren.
P22 0170  1    I asked him about it one night while we were sitting
P22 0180  1    in his truck. I asked him if it was true.
P22 0180 11       He gave me a straight, honest answer. "Look, Sue
P22 0190  5    baby", he'd said. Much as I love you- well, a guy's
P22 0200  6    a guy and Lucille's willing to- to come across. Honest,
P22 0210  5    kitten, that's all it is- I don't even like Lucille
P22 0220  3    much".
P22 0220  4       I guess it was at that moment that I realized what
P22 0230  3    I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren. But
P22 0240  1    it didn't seem fair. My love for Johnnie was young
P22 0240 11    and clean- how could I possibly compete with a woman
P22 0250  9    like that, who didn't hesitate to use her sex.
P22 0260  5       Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit
P22 0270  2    in a town about twenty miles away, and he was also
P22 0270 13    pretty good at anything in the carpentry line. It was
P22 0280  9    a vivid, sharp February morning that Johnnie first
P22 0290  5    made his appearance in my back yard, bringing some
P22 0300  2    stuff Dad had ordered. I wasn't in the habit of batting
P22 0310  1    my eyes at delivery men, but the moment I saw Johnnie,
P22 0310 12    I knew he was different. He wasn't only different-
P22 0320  6    he was it. He had an easy masculine grace about him,
P22 0330  6    the kind that kids don't have, but that I had sometimes
P22 0340  5    admired in other older men. His smile was quick, and
P22 0350  2    his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees
P22 0350 12    go limp.
P22 0360  1       The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting
P22 0360  9    was that he seemed interested in me, too. I could hardly
P22 0370  9    believe such good luck was mine.
P22 0380  5       And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him.
P22 0390  3    I guess she was between affairs or something, but anyway,
P22 0390 13    she had set her sights on Johnnie, my Johnnie.
P22 0400  9       I didn't like it one bit. But what could I do? A
P22 0410 11    man had to have his release- at least that's what the
P22 0420  8    boys used to say in high school- and I wasn't providing
P22 0430  4    it for Johnnie. Neither was his wife. She wouldn't
P22 0431  2    have, even if he'd asked her.
P22 0431  8       But he wouldn't ask her- he wasn't the kind of man
P22 0432  9    who would force his wife to submit to him against her
P22 0433  5    will. And he wouldn't leave her either- he'd told me
P22 0434  3    that. He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless
P22 0434 13    and leave those helpless children without their daddy.
P22 0435  8       Johnnie loved me and wanted me. But the only love
P22 0436 10    I was giving him was the pure kind. It was weeks before
P22 0437  7    we even kissed for the first time.
P22 0440  1    ##
P22 0440  2    Against my folks' wishes, we'd been seeing each other
P22 0450  7    for short rides in the truck. The rides were tame enough-
P22 0460  6    mostly we talked. But by the time the first crackling
P22 0470  3    of spring came around, we both knew we were hopelessly
P22 0480  1    in love. Yet even then we did nothing much but talk,
P22 0480 12    and maybe neck a little.
P22 0490  3       "It's so crazy", I told him once. "I always imagined
P22 0500  2    I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody
P22 0500 12    like that. Somebody with no vices. You know".
P22 0510  8       "And you fall for a lumber jockey".
P22 0520  6       "Who drinks far too much".
P22 0530  1       "And smokes too much".
P22 0530  5       "And", I was ticking off the items on my fingers,
P22 0540  6    "swears too much and goes out with the boys, whoever
P22 0550  2    they are, too much, and who never goes to church and
P22 0560  2    won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come
P22 0560 13    back to the fold".
P22 0570  2       He examined his nails carefully. "I could walk out
P22 0580  2    the door".
P22 0580  4       "Don't you dare".
P22 0580  7       "And never show my face or my truck around here
P22 0590  9    again". He still wasn't looking at me.
P22 0600  3       "You wouldn't".
P22 0600  5       "Or I could visit Lucille Warren".
P22 0610  3       "You wouldn't. Please! You wouldn't".
P22 0620  1       He shrugged noncommittally. "I might".
P22 0630  1       And now he was seeing her. He'd just admitted it
P22 0630 10    to me. I huddled miserably beside him in the truck.
P22 0640  7    It was all my doing- his seeing her. Johnnie and I
P22 0650  6    had been innocent in our love, and that was the way
P22 0660  3    I wanted to keep it. At first, Johnnie hadn't understood-
P22 0670  3    how could he, not being a religious person like me?
P22 0670 13    But then he had said, "All right, kid, if that's how
P22 0680 10    you want it, that's how it'll be".
P22 0690  4       But what had I done, trying to keep us pure? I had
P22 0700  3    driven him into the arms of that scheming woman. I
P22 0700 13    had just the same as delivered him into the hands of
P22 0710 10    the Devil!
P22 0720  1       So one week later, I surrendered to him in the little
P22 0720 11    motel on Route 10. My very first time. I was desperate
P22 0730  9    to hold him, to give him whatever in this world he
P22 0740  5    wanted or needed, and to keep him from the clutches
P22 0750  1    of Lucille Warren.
P22 0750  4       And, though at the time I blushed to admit it even
P22 0760  5    to myself, there was in me a growing desire, a sexual
P22 0770  1    awareness, that Johnnie had set in motion, an awareness
P22 0770 10    that no other man had ever triggered. I wanted him,
P22 0780  8    with a terrifying fierceness.
P22 0790  1       Astonishingly enough, it was my own voice I heard
P22 0790 10    there in the darkness, begging this man to make love
P22 0800  8    to me.
P22 0800 10       "Love me, Johnnie".
P22 0810  2       "I will, kitten"!
P22 0810  5       Outside, in the summertime fields behind the motel,
P22 0820  5    a thousand crickets serenaded us. "Will you always
P22 0830  3    love me this way"?
P22 0830  7       "Uh huh. Always".
P22 0840  1       "Mmm". And I snuggled closer to the man l loved.
P22 0850  1       It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any
P22 0850 10    bride ever experienced. I had had no wedding ceremony,
P22 0860  7    no witnesses, no certificate of marriage, but I had
P22 0870  4    all the joy that goes with them.
P22 0870 11       "Johnnie ...?
P22 0880  2       "It can't be wrong, can it? Not really".
P22 0890  1       Johnnie rose on one elbow. "Stop worrying. It's
P22 0890  9    never wrong if love is real".
P22 0900  5       I took great comfort from his words, and smiled
P22 0910  3    to myself in the darkness. Infinite peace, complete
P22 0910 11    contentment. Idiot's delight, I later discovered.
P22 0920  6    ##
P22 0920  7    I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my
P22 0940  8    strict religious upbringing. I had always resisted
P22 0950  3    the passes made at me by other kids, and many times
P22 0960  1    I had thought about my love for Johnnie who, being
P22 0960 11    thirty, brought a maturity to love that the kids around
P22 0970  8    town could know nothing about. I had also thought a
P22 0980  6    lot about how God must look on true love, and so in
P22 0990  2    a way I was keeping my promise to God, my promise to
P22 0990 14    remain pure until I was married.
P22 1000  5       I was practically a bride, after all.
P22 1010  1       There would have been a ceremony if it had been
P22 1010 11    possible. Of this, I had no doubt. Wouldn't Johnnie
P22 1020  9    do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness?
P22 1030  8    Of course he would. He'd not only told me so, he'd
P22 1040  7    proved it. It wasn't Johnnie's fault that he was hopelessly
P22 1050  5    tied down to that frightful woman who did her best
P22 1060  3    to make his life unbearable. Just because he was honorable
P22 1070  1    enough to want to continue supporting his two children,
P22 1070 10    as any decent man would, that was no reason he should
P22 1080  9    be denied his own small share of happiness too. And
P22 1090  5    if I could contribute to that, I'd do it. The cost
P22 1100  2    didn't matter. No price is too high when true love
P22 1100 12    is at stake.
P22 1110  1       And I had no doubts about how true this love was.
P22 1110 12    I'd never even petted with a boy, and after I met Johnnie
P22 1120 12    he never touched me for the longest while, not until
P22 1130  8    I all but threw myself at him. He was plenty attentive,
P22 1140  5    all right, but he behaved like a gentleman, and I figured
P22 1150  4    that, emotionally, I was closer to his age than to
P22 1160  1    my own eighteen and a half. What could a mere twelve
P22 1160 12    years matter? It wasn't, I was sure, a difference in
P22 1170  9    age that came between people, but a difference in maturity.
P22 1180  6       And hadn't I rescued him from Lucille Warren? She'd
P22 1190  4    have gotten him, if I hadn't stopped her. After all,
P22 1200  4    Lucille Warren was a husband-stealer from way back.
P22 1210  2       But I'd been a good girl and now God was blessing
P22 1220  1    me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous
P22 1220 12    love we shared. It was only fitting that we seek out
P22 1230 10    whatever joy our union might bring.
P22 1240  2       "Love me"?
P22 1240  4       "Uh-huh. Love you".
P22 1250  1       "Always and always, Johnnie"?
P22 1250  5       "Always".
P22 1260  1       "Mmm".
P22 1260  2       Convention time in Boston. A chill wind in the air
P22 1270  7    and the narrow streets packed with snow. From the entire
P22 1280  3    eastern half of the nation they'd be coming, members
P22 1290  1    of the Young Christians' League, and I'd been chosen
P22 1290 10    to represent our chapter.
P22 1300  3       I had mixed emotions about going. I'd been seeing
P22 1310  2    Johnnie almost a year now, but I still didn't want
P22 1310 12    to leave him for five whole days. But I had looked
P22 1320 10    forward so much to being with this church group. I
P22 1330  6    hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield
P22 1340  4    and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder
P22 1350  1    than ever. I wanted to just throw myself into the good
P22 1350 12    works of this fine group. So I went to Boston.
P22 1360  8       The first meeting was held in Faneuil Hall, a great
P22 1370  7    big place where we were able to meet members from all
P22 1380  3    the other states. My cousin Alma, at whose home I was
P22 1390  1    staying during the convention, introduced me to a group
P22 1390 10    of young people from Rhode Island. One of them was
P22 1400  8    a very friendly, lovely fellow named Ronald, a boy
P22 1410  5    about my age with slick, blond hair and dancing blue
P22 1420  2    eyes. He looked very different from Johnnie- in fact,
P22 1420 11    he looked sort of like me. I thought so, and he mentioned
P22 1430 11    it, and Alma said so too.
P22 1440  3       After the meeting, there was going to be a party
P22 1440 13    at someone's house. I assumed Alma would get me there,
P22 1450 10    but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up, we
P22 1460  7    were separated. Outside the hall, I anxiously looked
P22 1470  4    around for her, then all at once there was a hand on
P22 1480  3    my elbow.
P22 1480  5       "Hey, there, beautiful twin of mine", Ronald said.
P22 1490  2    "Need a pumpkin to get to the party"?
P22 1490 10       I couldn't help laughing with him. "Well, I should
P22 1500  8    find Alma"- I began.
P22 1510  5       "Alma, Schmalma. Come along with me". I went.
P22 1520  1    ##
P22 1520  2    By the time we arrived, the party was already going
P22 1520 12    strong. A couple of the girls were laughing rather
P22 1530  9    shrilly and I realized they were drinking. My folks
P22 1540  6    wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house, so my
P22 1550  4    first taste of it had been- of course- with Johnnie.
P22 1570  1    I hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning.
P22 1570 12    But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale,
P22 1580  8    I enjoyed it. Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if
P22 1590  6    I did it with Johnnie. Johnnie ... I suddenly realized
P22 1600  5    he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening. But
P22 1610  2    that was only natural, I decided; surely he was still
P22 1610 12    resting snugly in my heart.
P22 1620  5       "I don't see Alma anywhere", I said.
P22 1630  3       "She's invisible tonight. C'mon, let's find out
P22 1640  2    where they're keeping the glasses".
P22 1640  7       I drew back. "I- I don't think so, Ronald. Not for
P22 1650 10    me".
P22 1650 11       "Aw, come on".
P22 1660  2       "No- really".
P22 1660  4       He shrugged. "Okay. But at least come along while
P22 1670  6    I get lubricated".
P22 1670  9       The kitchen was jammed. Strange faces, most of them,
P22 1680  8    and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the
P22 1690  8    League meeting.
