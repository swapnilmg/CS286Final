E10 0010  1       The average reader of this magazine owns more than
E10 0010 10    one gun (we ran a survey to find out) but he's always
E10 0020 10    on the lookout for new and better arms. He's more than
E10 0030  6    a reader of outdoor articles; he's a real hunter and
E10 0040  5    shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're
E10 0050  1    that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've
E10 0050 11    probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to
E10 0060  9    the guns in your rack, but it's not easy to decide
E10 0070  7    on a new one. You still have time to drop a few hints
E10 0080  5    about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time to
E10 0090  2    decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've
E10 0090 12    taken a close look at this year's crop of new models.
E10 0100  9    Here they are, with my comments and judgments. Read
E10 0110  5    on, take your pick- and start dropping those hints.
E10 0120  3       First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle
E10 0130  1    and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest
E10 0130 11    sense. For me, a changed barrel length or an improved
E10 0140 10    stock doesn't constitute a truly new design. Such modifications
E10 0150  7    are all for the best but it takes something as different
E10 0160  6    as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.
E10 0170  4       Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker (under $110)
E10 0180  3    is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all
E10 0180 14    the modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short,
E10 0190 10    light, quick-handling, fast-firing little timber gun
E10 0200  6    designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but
E10 0210  5    with lots of killing power and ample range for our
E10 0220  2    most popular big game- whitetail.
E10 0220  7       Ruger reports that on his recent African safari
E10 0230  6    the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.
E10 0240  4    Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot,
E10 0250  1    and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob
E10 0250 10    and wart hog with deadly efficiency; these are fairly
E10 0260  6    large, tough animals.
E10 0270  1       The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes
E10 0270 11    as no surprise to me. At least five years ago, Tom
E10 0280  8    Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle
E10 0290  3    for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model
E10 0300  1    90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how
E10 0300 11    to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same
E10 0310  9    point of impact, we fired this little 20-inch-barrel
E10 0320  5    job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test
E10 0330  2    gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that
E10 0330 11    plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments: Three
E10 0340  7    or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch
E10 0350  7    bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, one could
E10 0360  3    stray far out of the group.
E10 0360  9       Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity
E10 0370  6    achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of
E10 0380  4    the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug
E10 0390  1    in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed
E10 0390 10    bullets, I had enough faith in my double to take it
E10 0400 10    on an opening-day deer hunt that first year. Within
E10 0410  5    half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped
E10 0420  3    through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just
E10 0420 12    behind the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only
E10 0430 10    about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him- and
E10 0440  8    this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling.
E10 0450  4       Three more deer have fallen to this same gun, and
E10 0460  3    all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight
E10 0470  1    revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length),
E10 0470  8    and although it compares well in other respects, it's
E10 0480  8    considerably heavier than the Deerstalker, which only
E10 0490  5    scales about 6-1/2 pounds.
E10 0490 10       If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter,
E10 0500 10    this is it. The Deerstalker points with the ease, speed
E10 0510  6    and precision of a fine imported double shotgun, and
E10 0520  4    its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain
E10 0530  1    bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 fps, which gives
E10 0530 10    it all the smash needed at woods ranges. With five
E10 0540  7    shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger
E10 0550  5    finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.
E10 0560  1       The second really new development this year was
E10 0560  9    a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load-
E10 0570  8    the .22 Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire. At present
E10 0580  6    it's available in one model, the fine and familiar
E10 0590  4    Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110), long a
E10 0600  3    top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity
E10 0600 11    of this .22-caliber, 40-grain bullet is rated at a
E10 0610  8    very hot 2,460 fps, and it's the flattest shooting
E10 0620  4    of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range rise of
E10 0630  3    about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint
E10 0630 15    load, pure and simple; it's much too explosive for
E10 0640  9    small edible game. It can cut a red squirrel neatly
E10 0650  8    in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers.
E10 0660  3       The most intriguing aspect of the S+W Magnum chambered
E10 0670  2    for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22
E10 0670 14    rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.
E10 0680  9    You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game
E10 0690  8    and plinking arm, although the difference in the point
E10 0700  4    of impact (Jet vs. rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting.
E10 0710  1    The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested
E10 0720  1    it in my scoped S+W and it was good enough to allow
E10 0720 13    me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I
E10 0730 10    did my part by holding the handgun steadily.
E10 0740  2    #HUNTING RIFLES, '61#
E10 0740  5    The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the
E10 0750  6    only completely new designs this year doesn't mean
E10 0760  2    that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and
E10 0760 11    calibers. Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of
E10 0770  9    hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time.
E10 0780  6    Here are the brands (in alphabetical order) and the
E10 0790  4    new models.
E10 0790  6       Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning
E10 0800  4    group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have
E10 0810  1    fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on
E10 0810 11    both the metal and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary
E10 0820  8    sensibly with the various calibers available, and these
E10 0830  5    include the standard bores (about $165) plus the Magnums
E10 0840  4    (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300 H+H,
E10 0850  2    .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads
E10 0850 11    are standard on all of the Magnums except the .264.
E10 0860  9    Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes.
E10 0870  5       Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with
E10 0880  4    Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have
E10 0890  1    the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action,
E10 0890 11    and the .270, **f and the Magnums, the long action
E10 0900  8    (about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for
E10 0910  5    the Custom version). Previously, FN actions were used
E10 0920  3    for the larger cartridges.
E10 0920  7       High standard has introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King,
E10 0930  8    in two grades- field and special (less than $45 and
E10 0940  5    just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined rifle,
E10 0950  2    fast and well-made.
E10 0950  6       Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire rifles, 1961's lone newcomer
E10 0960  5    was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader (around $60). Previously
E10 0970  4    known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given this 11-shot
E10 0980  4    hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design,
E10 0980 11    and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum
E10 0990 10    rim-fires.
E10 1000  1       Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest
E10 1010  8    of new offerings. The Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight,
E10 1020  9    streamlined .22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine
E10 1030  5    that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely accurate
E10 1040  2    for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely
E10 1050  1    trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is
E10 1050 10    an even newer .22 auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot
E10 1060 11    clip.
E10 1060 12       Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared,
E10 1070  6    but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination.
E10 1080  2    The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert
E10 1090  2    tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives
E10 1090 10    pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches
E10 1100  9    long. You can unscrew this tube and replace it with
E10 1110  7    a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells- to
E10 1120  4    break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing
E10 1130  1    these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that
E10 1130 10    the shooter can throw his own targets. A spring trap
E10 1140  8    for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also
E10 1150  5    available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot
E10 1160  1    repeater, the 340TR (about $40) or a single-shot,
E10 1160 10    the 320TR ($10 less).
E10 1170  3       The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for
E10 1180  3    economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than
E10 1180 11    it looks to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll
E10 1190 11    travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring
E10 1200  7    trap but it's almost impossible to break one after
E10 1210  4    it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin
E10 1220  1    pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to
E10 1220 10    get on the birds, right now!
E10 1230  3       Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line
E10 1240  1    for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to
E10 1240 12    the list of Model 725's. These are made on special
E10 1250  7    order only, in Kodiak grade (about $310), with integral
E10 1260  5    muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads; they weigh
E10 1270  3    around nine pounds.
E10 1270  6       A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington
E10 1280  4    742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This carbine
E10 1290  2    (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has
E10 1290 12    an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by
E10 1300  7    the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a
E10 1310  6    short-barrel. This design is hard to beat for timber
E10 1320  3    hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently,
E10 1330  1    the 742C is available in **f.
E10 1330  7       The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99
E10 1340  4    are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the 99 Deluxe
E10 1350  3    (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved
E10 1350 13    trigger design. The replacement of the slide-lock side
E10 1360  9    safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more
E10 1370  7    appealing than ever since the new safety is easier
E10 1380  4    and faster to operate.
E10 1380  8    #BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61#
E10 1390  1    A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961,
E10 1390 11    and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list
E10 1400  8    if you're wondering what to get for a youngster. The
E10 1410  6    most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about $20, $5
E10 1420  3    for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot
E10 1420 12    patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action
E10 1430  7    and featuring the Western look. Because of its traditional
E10 1440  6    lines, it probably has more kid appeal than any other
E10 1450  5    model. The action is a drop-block, handling all the
E10 1460  2    standard .22 rim-fires.
E10 1460  6       Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning
E10 1470  4    shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty
E10 1480  1    of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model
E10 1480 11    122 (about $20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with
E10 1490  9    an automatic safety- i.e., the safety goes on every
E10 1500  7    time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the
E10 1510  4    next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model
E10 1520  1    is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22
E10 1520 12    single-shot Remington 514C (around $20), which comes
E10 1530  6    with a 21-inch barrel and a short- 12-1/2-inch- stock;
E10 1540  5    it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.
E10 1550  1       A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this
E10 1550  9    year. The single-barrel Stevens 940Y (under $35) is
E10 1560  9    made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever
E10 1570  7    because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate
E10 1580  4    a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does indeed
E10 1590  2    open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock
E10 1590 13    and is available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's
E10 1600  9    another addition to the Stevens line, the pump-action
E10 1610  7    Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which you may or may
E10 1620  5    not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters
E10 1630  1    like this gauge and type of scattergun too.
E10 1630  9    #SHOTGUNS, '61#
E10 1630 11    Although there were no startling developments in shotgun
E10 1640  8    design this year, a number of new models and variations
E10 1650  8    of existing models did hit the market. For example,
E10 1660  5    a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under,
E10 1670  2    the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs
E10 1680  1    from standard models in that it is equipped with a
E10 1680 11    full beavertail fore end, a cushion recoil pad and
E10 1690  7    a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.
E10 1700  2       The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the
E10 1700 11    Standard or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150,
E10 1710  9    respectively) in 12, 16 and 20.
E10 1720  5       Firearms International has introduced another import,
E10 1730  2    this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170),
E10 1730 11    a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington
E10 1740  8    32- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still
E10 1750  9    brings high prices.
E10 1750 12       High Standard has also added two models to its line.
E10 1760 10    The Supermatic Trophy (prices begin at less than $135
E10 1770  7    and depend on grade and optional features) is a 12-gauge
E10 1780  6    auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at just over
E10 1790  3    $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very
E10 1790 17    good dollar value.
E10 1800  3       Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the
E10 1810  2    Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version
E10 1810 11    of the old Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.
E10 1820  9    See page 24 for a complete report on it.
E10 1830  4    #HANDGUNS, '61#
E10 1830  6    Aside from the .22 Jet- which I coupled with the Deerstalker
E10 1840  6    carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments-
E10 1850  3    few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns.
