L15 0009  1    "Through a door conveniently unlocked", Madden supplemented.
L15 0009  8       "That damn door", said the police chief.
L15 0010  8       "A gift horse to be viewed with suspicion". Madden's
L15 0020  7    dark face wore a meditative look. "If there was collusion
L15 0030  6    between an outside murderer and a member of the household
L15 0040  6    it would be an elementary precaution to check on the
L15 0050  3    door later. And it makes a very poor red herring for
L15 0050 14    an inside job. Much better to break a cellar window".
L15 0060  9       "Don't forget, there was the hope it would pass
L15 0070  9    for a natural death", Pauling reminded him.
L15 0080  3       "Well, with a house as big as that there must be
L15 0090  3    at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed
L15 0090 12    right away unless there was a police investigation".
L15 0100  7       "Yeah. And a pane of glass isn't hard to"-
L15 0110  7       The telephone interrupted him. He scooped up the
L15 0120  6    receiver and said, "Police chief", into the mouthpiece,
L15 0130  3    and then, "Oh yes, Mr. Benson. I was hoping I'd hear
L15 0140  2    from you today".
L15 0140  5       With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward
L15 0150  4    him and began to make notes as he listened, saying,
L15 0160  1    "Uh-huh" and "I see" at intervals.
L15 0160  8       At last he said, "Well, thank you for calling, Mr.
L15 0170  7    Benson. Although there was no doubt in my mind and
L15 0180  7    we've been handling it as one I'm glad to have it made
L15 0190  5    official".
L15 0190  6       He hung up. "Coroner", he said to Madden. "He's
L15 0200  4    just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker
L15 0210  2    apparently died from suffocation". Pauling looked at
L15 0210  9    his notes. "Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles
L15 0220  9    of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils. Scrapings
L15 0230  9    from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread
L15 0240  7    found in the nasal and oral cavities. No other cause
L15 0250  4    of death apparent. Trachea clear of mucus and foreign
L15 0260  1    objects. Brain examined for thrombosis, clot or hemorrhage.
L15 0260  9    No signs of these, no gross hemorrhage of lungs, heart,
L15 0270  9    brain or stomach". He paused. "That's about it. Oh,
L15 0280  7    the time of death. The duration of the digestive process
L15 0290  5    varies, the pathologist says, but the empty stomach
L15 0300  2    and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract
L15 0300 10    indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after
L15 0310  8    her seven-o'clock dinner. Probably around midnight,
L15 0320  5    give or take an hour either way".
L15 0330  1       Pauling paused again. "So there it is", he said.
L15 0330 10    "Not your problem, of course, unless Johnston and the
L15 0340  9    murderer are one and the same".
L15 0350  4       They discussed this possibility. However likely
L15 0360  1    it was, Pauling said, he couldn't limit himself to
L15 0360 10    it. He had to look for other prospects, other motives
L15 0370  8    until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston
L15 0380  4    came to light. Madden, with his investigation centered
L15 0390  2    on the fraud, said that tomorrow he would go to the
L15 0390 13    Bronx bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston
L15 0400  9    had cleared.
L15 0410  1       Arthur Williams had to be located, they agreed.
L15 0410  9    He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the
L15 0420  9    fraud; he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played
L15 0430  6    some part in her death. This was Madden's suggestion;
L15 0440  4    the police chief shook his head over it. If Arthur
L15 0450  3    Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder, then
L15 0450 13    he too had another identity. No one the Medfield police
L15 0460 10    had questioned professed to know any more about him
L15 0470  8    than about Johnston.
L15 0470 11       Scholarship applicant? Pauling looked doubtful.
L15 0480  5    Madden explained that he was thinking of an application
L15 0490  7    sent directly to Mrs. Meeker. Then he asked to use
L15 0500  6    the phone and called Brian Thayer, who said that he
L15 0510  2    was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be
L15 0510 13    home by two o'clock.
L15 0520  2       Madden said that he would see him at two and made
L15 0520 13    another call, this one to Mrs. Meeker's lawyers. Mr.
L15 0530  9    Hohlbein was out for the day, but Mr. Garth would be
L15 0540 11    free at one-thirty. The secretary's tone indicated
L15 0550  4    that an appointment at such short notice was a concession
L15 0560  4    for which Madden should be duly grateful.
L15 0570  1       He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced
L15 0570  9    lawyers.
L15 0580  1       He had lunch with Pauling. Promptly at one-thirty
L15 0580 10    he entered Hohlbein and Garth's elegant suite of offices
L15 0590  7    in Medfield's newest professional building.
L15 0600  3       He disliked Garth on sight, conservative clothes
L15 0610  2    and haircut, smile a shade too earnestly boyish for
L15 0610 11    a man who must be well into his thirties, handclasp
L15 0620  9    too consciously quick and firm. Youngish man on the
L15 0630  6    make, Madden labeled him, and was ready to guess that
L15 0640  4    in a correct, not too pushing fashion, the junior partner
L15 0650  1    of the firm had political ambitions; that Mrs. Garth
L15 0650 10    would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising
L15 0660  9    young lawyer; that there were three children, two boys
L15 0670  6    and a girl; that she was active in the Woman's Club
L15 0680  3    and he in Lions, Rotary, and Jaycee; and finally, that
L15 0690  2    neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion
L15 0690 10    since their wedding day.
L15 0700  3       Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about
L15 0710  1    all this, but also knew that he would go right on disliking
L15 0710 13    Garth.
L15 0720  1       Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred
L15 0720 11    to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston
L15 0730  7    affair, which would not, he said more than once, have
L15 0740  8    ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to
L15 0750  6    consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it.
L15 0760  1       Madden regretted not being able to find fault with
L15 0760 10    so true a statement. He asked to see a copy of Mrs.
L15 0770  9    Meeker's will.
L15 0770 11       Garth brought one out.
L15 0780  4       The date, October 8, 1957, immediately caught the
L15 0800  2    inspector's eye. "Fairly recent", he remarked. "Was
L15 0800  9    she in the habit of making new wills"?
L15 0810  8       "Oh no. She had reason to change the one she made
L15 0820  7    right after Mr. Meeker's death. Her estate had grown
L15 0830  4    considerably. She wanted to make a more equitable distribution
L15 0840  2    of it among the groups that would benefit the most;
L15 0840 12    particularly the scholarship fund. At the time the
L15 0850  8    will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally
L15 0860  7    alert she seemed for her age, knowing just what changes
L15 0870  5    she wanted made and so forth".
L15 0870 11       Garth hesitated. "Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed
L15 0880  8    some lapses since, though. Most of them this past year,
L15 0890  8    I'd say. Even two or three years ago I doubt that she'd
L15 0900  7    have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair.
L15 0910  3    She'd have consulted us, you see. She always did before,
L15 0920  3    and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised".
L15 0930  1       The inspector nodded, doubting this. Mrs. Meeker
L15 0930  8    hadn't struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise,
L15 0940  9    least of all Garth's. With her sharp tongue she'd have
L15 0950  7    cut his pompousness to ribbons. It would have been
L15 0960  5    Hohlbein who handled her affairs.
L15 0960 10       Madden settled back to read the will.
L15 0970  7       He skimmed over the millions that went to Meeker
L15 0980  5    Park, Medfield Hospital, the civic center, the Public
L15 0990  3    Health Nursing Association, the library, and so on,
L15 0990 11    pausing when he came to the scholarship fund. Two millions
L15 1000 10    were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs.
L15 1010 10    Meeker's lifetime, and the proviso made that as long
L15 1020  7    as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as
L15 1030  4    administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the
L15 1030 13    board of trustees (hereinafter appointed by the bank
L15 1040  8    administering the estate) he was to be retained in
L15 1050  7    his present capacity at a salary commensurate with
L15 1060  2    the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund
L15 1060  9    would entail.
L15 1070  2       A splendid vote of confidence in Thayer, Madden
L15 1080  1    reflected. Tenure, too. Very nice for him.
L15 1080  8       He went on to personal bequests, a list of names
L15 1090  6    largely unknown to him. Twenty-five thousand to each
L15 1100  3    of the great-nieces in Oregon (not much to blood relatives
L15 1110  1    out of millions) ten thousand to this friend and that,
L15 1110 11    five thousand to another; to Brian Thayer, the sum
L15 1120  8    of ten thousand dollars; to the Pecks, ten thousand
L15 1130  6    each; to Joan Sheldon the conditional bequest of ten
L15 1140  4    thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was
L15 1150  1    still in Mrs. Meeker's employ at the time of the latter's
L15 1150 12    death. (No additional five thousand for each year after
L15 1160  9    Joan's twenty-first birthday; Mrs. Meeker hadn't got
L15 1170  6    around to taking care of that.)
L15 1180  3       Too bad, Madden thought. Joan Sheldon had earned
L15 1190  1    the larger bequest.
L15 1190  4       Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand, Garth ten.
L15 1200  3    There were no other names Madden recognized. Arthur
L15 1200 11    Williams's might well have been included, he felt.
L15 1210  8    Mrs. Meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for
L15 1220  9    him but had made no provision for him in her will if
L15 1230  6    he should be found after her death, and had never mentioned
L15 1240  2    his name to her lawyers.
L15 1240  7       Madden took up this point with Garth, who shrugged
L15 1250  5    it off. "Old people have their idiosyncrasies".
L15 1260  1       "This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or
L15 1260 11    more".
L15 1280  1       "Well, she had a number of them where money was
L15 1280 11    concerned", Garth said. "Sometimes we'd have trouble
L15 1290  7    persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions,
L15 1300  6    and I've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a
L15 1310  6    bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment she'd put
L15 1320  3    another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty
L15 1330  1    thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate
L15 1330  9    Johnston affair. There was no telling how she'd react
L15 1340  9    to spending money".
L15 1350  1       Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship
L15 1350 10    fund.
L15 1360  1       There was an annual audit, Garth informed him. No
L15 1360 10    discrepancies or shortages had ever been found. Brian
L15 1370  8    Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator.
L15 1380  5    His salary had reached the ten thousand mark. His expenses
L15 1390  4    ran another four or five thousand. The lawyer didn't
L15 1400  2    know him very well although he saw him occasionally
L15 1400 11    at some dinner party- Thayer, like himself, Madden
L15 1410  7    reflected, was the extra man so prized by hostesses-
L15 1420  6    and found him easy enough to talk to. But he didn't
L15 1430  4    play golf, didn't seem to belong to any local clubs-
L15 1440  3    his work took him away a lot, of course- which probably
L15 1440 14    accounted for his tendency to keep to himself.
L15 1450  8       Garth's glance began to flicker to his watch.
L15 1460  6       He said that he had already told the police chief
L15 1470  3    that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended
L15 1480  1    Johnston to Mrs. Meeker. He would offer no theory to
L15 1480 11    account for her murder. The whole thing, his manner
L15 1490  9    conveyed, was so far outside the normal routine of
L15 1500  5    Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being
L15 1510  2    swept under the rug.
L15 1510  6       No doubt Mrs. Meeker had snubbed him many a time
L15 1520  6    and he felt no grief over her passing. Even so, Madden's
L15 1530  2    dislike of the suave, correct lawyer deepened. It would
L15 1540  1    be all right with him, he decided, if his investigation
L15 1540 11    of the fraud, with its probable by-product of murder,
L15 1550  8    led to Garth's door. Motive? Ten-thousand-dollar bequest.
L15 1560  5    At first glance, not much of a motive for a man of
L15 1570  5    his standing; but for all his air of affluence, who
L15 1580  1    could tell what his private financial picture was?
L15 1580  9       The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful
L15 1590  9    thinking. Nevertheless, he made a mental note to look
L15 1600  8    into Garth's financial background.
L15 1610  1       Brian Thayer had a downtown address. He lived in
L15 1610 10    an apartment house not over three or four years old,
L15 1620  9    a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on
L15 1630  5    the fringe of the business district.
L15 1630 11       He occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth
L15 1640  9    floor, using the second bedroom as his office. Airy
L15 1650  6    and bright, the apartment was furnished with good modern
L15 1660  4    furniture, rugs, and draperies. Done by a professional
L15 1670  1    decorator, Madden thought, and somehow as impersonal,
L15 1670  8    as unremarkable as its occupant. In Dunston the rent
L15 1680  8    would run close to two hundred a month; in Medfield,
L15 1690  5    perhaps twenty-five less, not all of it paid by Thayer,
L15 1700  4    who could charge off one room on his expense account.
L15 1710  1       He took Madden into the room he used as an office.
L15 1710 12    It contained a desk, files, a typewriter on a stand,
L15 1720  9    and two big leather armchairs. A newspaper open at
L15 1730  5    stock-market reports lay on one of them. Thayer folded
L15 1740  2    it up and offered a drink.
L15 1740  8       The inspector declined. To begin the interview,
L15 1750  5    he asked if Thayer, with more time to think it over,
L15 1760  3    could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston.
L15 1770  1       Thayer shook his head. "It's all I think about,
L15 1770 10    too. That and her death. It's still unbelievable that
L15 1780  9    it was murder. For all her domineering ways, I can't
L15 1790  7    conceive of her having had a deadly enemy".
