B24 0010  2    _THE UNORIGINALS_
B24 0010  4       To write a play, the dramatist once needed an idea
B24 0020  4    plus the imagination, the knowledge of life and the
B24 0030  1    craft to develop it. Nowadays, more and more, all he
B24 0030 11    needs is someone else's book. To get started, he does
B24 0040  8    not scan the world about him; he and his prospective
B24 0050  5    producer just read the bestseller lists. So far this
B24 0060  3    season, Broadway's premieres have included twice as
B24 0060 10    many adaptations and imports as original American stage
B24 0070  8    plays.
B24 0080  1    _BEST FROM ABROAD._
B24 0080  2       Of straight dramas, there are All the Way Home,
B24 0090  1    which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee
B24 0090 12    novel, A Death in the Family; The Wall, awkwardly based
B24 0100  8    on the John Hersey novel; Advise and Consent, lively
B24 0110  6    but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed
B24 0120  5    bestseller; Face of a Hero (closed), based on a Pierre
B24 0130  5    Boulle novel. The only original works attempting to
B24 0140  2    reach any stature: Tennessee Williams' disappointing
B24 0140  8    domestic comedy, Period of Adjustment, and Arthur Laurents'
B24 0150  8    clever but empty Invitation to a March. Clearly the
B24 0160  9    most provocative plays are all imported originals-
B24 0170  6    A Taste of Honey, by Britain's young (19 when she wrote
B24 0180  6    it) Shelagh Delaney; Becket, by France's Jean Anouilh;
B24 0190  5    The Hostage (closed), by Ireland's Brendan Behan.
B24 0200  3       Among the musicals, Camelot came from T. H. White's
B24 0210  5    The Once and Future King, and novels were the sources
B24 0220  4    of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi.
B24 0230  3    Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals,
B24 0240  1    but pretty bad, leaving top honors again to an import-
B24 0240 11    the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce. The
B24 0250  9    only other works at least technically original were
B24 0260  6    dreary farces- Send Me No Flowers (closed), Under the
B24 0270  5    Yum-Yum Tree, Critic's Choice. In the forthcoming The
B24 0280  5    Conquering Hero and Carnival, Broadway is not even
B24 0290  5    adapting books, but reconverting old movies (Hail the
B24 0300  3    Conquering Hero and Lili).
B24 0300  7    _DRY OF LIFE._
B24 0305  1       Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations
B24 0310  7    are not necessarily bad. Some memorable plays have
B24 0320  6    been drawn from books, notably Life with Father and
B24 0330  4    Diary of Anne Frank. And particularly in the musical
B24 0340  2    field, adaptations have long been the rule, from Die
B24 0340 11    Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma! and My
B24 0350  9    Fair Lady. As Critic Walter Kerr points out: "Adaptations,
B24 0370  1    so long as they are good, still qualify as creative".
B24 0370 11    And other defenders invariably argue that, after all,
B24 0380  6    Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too. The difference
B24 0390  5    is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and
B24 0400  5    filled it with their own world; most modern adapters
B24 0410  1    totally accept the world of a book, squeeze it dry
B24 0410 11    of life, and add only one contribution of their own:
B24 0420  6    stage technique.
B24 0420  8       The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals
B24 0430  8    and tested imports is increasing production expense-
B24 0440  5    producers cannot afford to take chances. But that explanation
B24 0450  4    is only partly true. Off-Broadway, where production
B24 0460  2    is still comparatively cheap, is proving itself only
B24 0460 10    slightly more original. Laudably enough, it is offering
B24 0470  8    classics and off-beat imports, but last week only one
B24 0480  7    U.S. original was on the boards, Robert D. Hock's stunning
B24 0490  5    Civil War work, Borak. The real trouble seems to be
B24 0500  6    the failing imagination of U.S. playwrights.
B24 0510  1    #NIGHTCLUBS#
B24 0510  2    _THE COOCH TERPERS_
B24 0510  5       He: "Come with me to the casbah". She: "By subway
B24 0520  9    or cab"?
B24 0530  1       That exchange was not only possible but commonplace
B24 0530  9    last week in Manhattan, as more and more New Yorkers
B24 0540  7    were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue, where
B24 0550  4    half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian
B24 0560  2    Nights, Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the
B24 0560 10    American inpost of belly dancing. Several more will
B24 0570  8    open soon. Their burgeoning popularity may be a result
B24 0580  7    of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints,
B24 0590  3    but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always
B24 0600  1    familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.
B24 0610  1       The belly boites, with their papier-mache palm trees
B24 0610  9    or hand-painted Ionic columns, heretofore existed mainly
B24 0620  6    on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families. Customers
B24 0630  5    often bring their children; between performances, enthusiastic
B24 0640  3    young men from the audience will take the floor to
B24 0650  4    demonstrate their own amateur graces. Except for the
B24 0650 12    odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor,
B24 0660  9    the people watch in calm absorption. Small, shirt-sleeved
B24 0670  1    orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time, using guitars,
B24 0680  3    violins, and more alien instruments with names that
B24 0690  1    would open Sesame: the oud, grandfather of the lute;
B24 0690 10    the darbuka, a small drum with the treelike shape of
B24 0700  9    a roemer glass; the def, a low-pitched tambourine.
B24 0710  5    The girls sit quietly with the musicians, wearing prim
B24 0720  2    dresses or plain, secretarial shifts, until it is time
B24 0720 11    to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare
B24 0730 12    uniform of the harem.
B24 0740  1    _CONTINUUM OF MANKIND._
B24 0740  4       If a dancer is good, she suggests purely and superbly
B24 0750  2    the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny-
B24 0750  9    the continuum of mankind. But a great many of what
B24 0760  9    Variety calls the "cooch terpers" are considerably
B24 0770  5    less cosmic than that. Each dancer follows the ancient
B24 0780  4    Oriental pattern- she glides sideways with shoulders
B24 0790  2    motionless while her stomach migrates, and, through
B24 0790  9    breathing and muscle control, she sends ripples across
B24 0800  8    her body to the fingertips and away to the far end
B24 0820  7    of the room. This is done at varying speeds, ranging
B24 0830  2    from the slow and fast Shifte Telli (a musical term
B24 0840  1    meaning double strings) to the fastest, ecstatic Karshilama
B24 0850  8    (meaning greetings or welcome). The New York dancers
B24 0860  8    are highly eclectic, varying the pattern with all kinds
B24 0870  6    of personal improvisations, back bends or floor crawls.
B24 0880  4    But they do not strip. The striptease is crass; the
B24 0890  2    belly dance leaves more to the imagination.
B24 0890  9       When a dancer does well, she provokes a quiet bombardment
B24 0900  8    of dollar bills- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit
B24 0910  5    the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips
B24 0920  3    into the dancers' costumes. With tips, the girls average
B24 0930  1    between $150 and $200 a week, depending on basic salary.
B24 0930 11    Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers,
B24 0940  9    the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks, and most
B24 0950  5    of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.
B24 0960  1    _THE MELTING POT._
B24 0960  4       All over the country, belly clubs have never been
B24 0970  2    bigger, especially in Detroit, Boston and Chicago,
B24 0970  9    and even in small towns; one of the best dancers, a
B24 0980 10    Turkish girl named Semra, works at a roadhouse outside
B24 0990  6    Bristol, Conn. The girls are kept booked and moving
B24 1000  4    by several agents, notably voluble, black-bearded Murat
B24 1010  2    Somay, a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the
B24 1010 13    central abdomen. He can offer nine Turkish girls, plans
B24 1020  9    to import at least 15 more. But a great many of the
B24 1030  9    dancers are more or less native. Sometimes they get
B24 1040  3    their initial experience in church haflis, conducted
B24 1050  1    by Lebanese and Syrians in the U.S., where they dance
B24 1050 11    with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.
B24 1065  9       As the girls come to belly dancing from this and
B24 1070  9    other origins, the melting pot has never bubbled more
B24 1080  6    intriguingly. Some Manhattan examples:
B24 1090  1       @ Jemela (surname: Gerby), 23, seems Hong Kong Oriental
B24 1100  1    but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother, was
B24 1100 11    born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy
B24 1120  4    and Textile High School, says she learned belly dancing
B24 1130  5    at family picnics.
B24 1130  8       @ Serene (Mrs. Wilson), 23, was born in Budapest
B24 1140  7    and raised in Manhattan. Daughter of a gypsy mother
B24 1150  5    who taught her to dance, she is one of the few really
B24 1160  2    beautiful girls in the New York casbah, with dark eyes
B24 1160 12    and dark, waist-length hair, the face of an adolescent
B24 1170  9    patrician and a lithe, glimmering body. Many belly
B24 1185  5    dancers are married, but Serene is one of the few who
B24 1190  5    will admit it.
B24 1190  8       @ Marlene (surname: Adamo), 25, a Brazilian divorcee
B24 1200  5    who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris,
B24 1210  3    now lives on Manhattan's West Side, is about the best
B24 1220  1    belly dancer working the casbah, loves it so much that
B24 1220 11    she dances on her day off. She has the small, highly
B24 1230  9    developed body of a prime athlete, and holds in contempt
B24 1240  5    the "girls who just move sex".
B24 1250  1       @ Leila (Malia Phillips), 25, is a Greenwich Village
B24 1250  9    painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair
B24 1270  5    that cascades almost to her ankles. A graduate of Hollywood
B24 1280  5    High School, she likes to imagine herself, as she takes
B24 1290  4    the floor, "a village girl coming in to a festival".
B24 1300  1       @ Gloria (surname: Ziraldo), circa 30, who was born
B24 1310  1    in Italy and once did "chorus work" in Toronto, has
B24 1310 11    been around longer than most of the others, wistfully
B24 1320  8    remembers the old days when "we used to get the seamen
B24 1340  7    from the ships, you know, with big turtleneck sweaters
B24 1350  2    and handkerchiefs and all. But the ships are very slow
B24 1360  1    now, and we don't get so many sailors any more". The
B24 1360 12    uptown crowd has moved in, and what girl worth her
B24 1370  9    seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a
B24 1380  4    button-down collar?
B24 1390  1    #A SHORT, TORMENTED SPAN#
B24 1390  5    Of the handful of painters that Austria has produced
B24 1400  3    in the 20th century, only one, Oskar Kokoschka, is
B24 1400 12    widely known in the U.S. This state of unawareness
B24 1410  9    may not last much longer. For ten years a small group
B24 1420  9    of European and U.S. critics has been calling attention
B24 1430  6    to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele,
B24 1440  3    who died 42 years ago at the age of 28. The critics'
B24 1450  2    campaign finally inspired the first major U.S. exhibit
B24 1460  1    of Schiele's works. The show has been to Boston and
B24 1460 11    Manhattan, will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis.
B24 1470  8    Last week it opened at the J. B. Speed Museum in Louisville,
B24 1480  9    at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was
B24 1490  7    being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los
B24 1500  4    Angeles.
B24 1500  5       Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant. His
B24 1510  4    people (see color) are angular and knobby-knuckled,
B24 1520  1    sometimes painfully stretched, sometimes grotesquely
B24 1520  6    foreshortened. His colors are dark and murky, and his
B24 1530  9    landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom.
B24 1540  5    But he painted some of the boldest and most original
B24 1550  3    pictures of his time, and even after nearly half a
B24 1550 13    century, the tense, tormented world he put on canvas
B24 1560  9    has lost none of its fascination.
B24 1570  2    _THE DEVIL HIMSELF._
B24 1570  5       The son of a railway stationmaster, Schiele lived
B24 1580  3    most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of
B24 1590  2    Tulln, 14 miles northwest of Vienna. He was an emotional,
B24 1590 12    lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings
B24 1600 10    that he did scarcely any schoolwork. When he was 15,
B24 1610  7    his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at
B24 1620  3    the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Even there he did
B24 1630  2    not last for long. Cried one professor after a few
B24 1630 12    months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion:
B24 1640  5    "The devil himself must have defecated you into my
B24 1650  6    classroom"!
B24 1650  7       For a while his work was influenced deeply by the
B24 1660  7    French impressionists, and by the patterned, mosaic-like
B24 1670  3    paintings of Gustav Klimt, then the dean of Austrian
B24 1680  1    art. Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his
B24 1680 10    own- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter.
B24 1690 10    His pictures were roundly denounced as "the most disgusting
B24 1700  7    things one has ever seen in Vienna". He himself was
B24 1710  6    once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24
B24 1720  4    days- the first three of which he spent desperately
B24 1720 13    trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.
B24 1730 11    For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper
B24 1740  9    collars, was even driven to scrounging for cigarette
B24 1750  5    butts in Vienna's gutters. Drafted into the Austrian
B24 1770  3    army, he rebelliously rejected discipline, wangled
B24 1770  9    a Vienna billet, went on painting. It was not until
B24 1780  9    the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking
B24 1790  8    show.
B24 1800  1    _MELANCHOLY OBSESSION._
B24 1800  1       The unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings
B24 1800 10    was not the only thing that kept the public at bay:
B24 1810  8    his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved
B24 1820  3    tragedy, and it was too much even for morbid-minded
B24 1830  1    Vienna. He was obsessed by disease and poverty, by
B24 1830 10    the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust.
B24 1840  8    The children he painted were almost always in rags,
B24 1850  4    his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness,
B24 1860  1    and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were
B24 1860  9    stringy, contorted and strangely pathetic. The subject
B24 1870  7    he liked most was the female body, which he painted
B24 1880  6    in every state- naked, half-dressed, muffled to the
B24 1890  4    ears, sitting primly in a chair, lying tauntingly on
B24 1890 13    a bed or locked in an embrace.
