C04 0010  1       The THEATRE-BY-THE-SEA, Matunuck, presents "King
C04 0020  1    of Hearts" by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke. Directed
C04 0030  9    by Michael Murray; settings by William David Roberts.
C04 0040  7    The cast: @
C04 0050  1       Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy
C04 0050  9    for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's
C04 0060  7    "King of Hearts".
C04 0070  1       The dialogue is sharp, witty and candid- typical
C04 0070  9    "don't eat the daisies" material- which has stamped
C04 0080  7    the author throughout her books and plays, and it was
C04 0090  7    obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked
C04 0100  2    it.
C04 0100  3       The story is of a famous strip cartoonist, an arty
C04 0110  2    individual, whose specialty is the American boy and
C04 0110 10    who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh
C04 0120 10    idea material.
C04 0120 12       This is when his troubles begin, not to mention
C04 0130  8    a fiedgling artist who he hires, and who turns out
C04 0140  5    to have ideas of his own, with particular respect to
C04 0150  2    the hero's sweetheart-secretary.
C04 0150  6       John Heffernan, playing Larry Larkin, the cartoonist,
C04 0160  5    carries the show in marvelous fashion. His portrayal
C04 0170  3    of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.
C04 0180  1       This may be unfortunate, perhaps, from the standpoint
C04 0190  1    of David Hedison, Providence's contribution to Hollywood,
C04 0190  8    who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox.
C04 0200  9    Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his
C04 0210 10    role. He does, and more. But the book is written around
C04 0220  7    a somewhat dizzy cartoonist, and it has to be that
C04 0230  5    way.
C04 0230  6       A word should be said for Gary Morgan, a Broadway
C04 0240  2    youngsters who, as the adopted son, makes life miserable
C04 0240 11    for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular. And
C04 0250  8    for his playmate, Francis Coletta of West Warwick,
C04 0260  5    who has a bit part, Billy.
C04 0270  1       On the whole, audiences will like this performance.
C04 0270  8    It is a tremendous book, lively, constantly moving,
C04 0280  5    and the Matunuck cast does well by it.
C04 0300  1       The NEWPORT PLAYHOUSE presents "EPITAPH FOR GEORGE
C04 0310  2    DILLON" by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton, directed
C04 0320  8    by Wallace Gray.
C04 0330  2       The cast: @
C04 0330  5       The angriest young man in Newport last night was
C04 0340  5    at the Playhouse, where "Epitaph for George Dillon"
C04 0350  2    opened as the jazz festival closed.
C04 0350  8       For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony
C04 0360  9    Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack
C04 0370  6    of beer during a jam session. He's mad at a world he
C04 0380  5    did not make.
C04 0380  8       Furthermore, he's something of a scoundrel, an artist
C04 0390  5    whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips. This is
C04 0400  3    in contrast to the family with whom he boards. They
C04 0400 13    not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as
C04 0410  9    well.
C04 0410 10       It is into this household, one eroded by irritations
C04 0420  6    that have tortured the souls out of its people, that
C04 0430  6    George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play.
C04 0440  2       An unsuccessful playwright and actor, he has faith
C04 0440 10    only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists.
C04 0450 12    By the end of the third act, the artist is dead but
C04 0460  8    the body lingers on, a shell among other shells.
C04 0470  2       Not altogether a successful play, "Epitaph for George
C04 0480  2    Dillon" overcomes through sheer vitality and power
C04 0480  9    what in a lesser work might be crippling. It is awfully
C04 0490 10    talky, for instance, and not all of the talk is terribly
C04 0500  9    impressive. But it strikes sparks on occasion and their
C04 0510  5    light causes all else to be forgotten.
C04 0520  1       There is a fine second act, as an example, one in
C04 0520 12    which Samuel Groom, as Dillon, has an opportunity to
C04 0530  7    blaze away in one impassioned passage after another.
C04 0540  3    This is an exciting young actor to watch.
C04 0550  1       Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient
C04 0550 10    way is Laura Stuart, whose complete control of her
C04 0560  6    every movement is lovely to watch. Miss Stuart is as
C04 0570  5    intensely vibrant as one could wish, almost an icy
C04 0580  2    shriek threatening to explode at any moment.
C04 0580  9       Also fine are Sue Lawless, as a mother more protective
C04 0590  8    and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive,
C04 0600  6    Harold Cherry, as her scratchy spouse, and Hildy Weissman,
C04 0610  5    as a vegetable in human form.
C04 0610 11       Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here,
C04 0620  8    usually well, but with just a bit too much physical
C04 0630  7    movement in the first act for my taste. Still, his
C04 0640  3    finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive
C04 0640 13    projection of that pale sustenance, despair.
C04 0660  1       The WARWICK MUSICAL THEATER presents "Where's Charley?"
C04 0670  2    with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, directed by
C04 0680  2    Christopher Hewett, choreography by Peter Conlow, musical
C04 0680  9    direction by Samuel Matlowsky. The cast: @
C04 0690  7       Everybody fell in love with Amy again last night
C04 0700  8    at the Warwick Musical Theater, and Shelley Berman
C04 0710  4    was to blame.
C04 0710  7       One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented,
C04 0720  4    "Once in Love with Amy" is also, of course, one of
C04 0730  3    the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics
C04 0730 11    to come out of American musical comedy in our era.
C04 0740  9    So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just
C04 0750  8    after Act II got a rousing opening chorus, "Where's
C04 0760  3    Charley?", and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage
C04 0770  4    with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering
C04 0780  1    into being.
C04 0780  3       It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no
C04 0790  3    attempt to outdo Ray Bolger. He dropped his earlier
C04 0790 12    and delightful hamming, which is about the only way
C04 0800  8    to handle the old war horse called "Charley's Aunt",
C04 0810  4    and let himself go with as an appealing an "Amy" as
C04 0820  4    anybody could ask.
C04 0820  7       In brief, Berman played himself and not Bolger.
C04 0830  5    The big audience started applauding even before he
C04 0840  3    had finished.
C04 0840  5       The whole production this week is fresh and lively.
C04 0850  3    The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous
C04 0860  1    gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days. The
C04 0860 11    ballet work is on the nose, especially in the opening
C04 0870  9    number by "The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students'
C04 0880  5    Conservatory Band", along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian
C04 0890  7    fantasia later.
C04 0890  9       Berman, whose fame has rested in recent years on
C04 0900  8    his skills as a night club monologist, proved himself
C04 0910  3    very much at home in musical comedy.
C04 0910 10       Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson, with sparkling blue
C04 0920  6    eyes and a cheerful smile, made a suitably perky Amy,
C04 0930  7    while Melisande Congdon, as the real aunt, was positively
C04 0940  1    monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner.
C04 0950  1       All told, "Where's Charley?" ought not to be missed.
C04 0960  1    It has a fast pace, excellent music, expert direction,
C04 0960 10    and not only a good comedian, but an appealing person
C04 0970  8    in his own right, Mr. Berman.
C04 0990  1       The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents
C04 0990  9    C. Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of "FIORELLO!"
C04 1010  1    at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The book is by Jerome
C04 1020  1    Weidman and George Abbott, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics
C04 1020 10    by Sheldon Harnick, choreography by Peter Gennaro,
C04 1030  6    scenery, costumes and lighting by William and Jean
C04 1040  6    Eckart, musical direction by Jack Elliott, and the
C04 1050  3    production was directed by Mr. Abbott. The cast: @
C04 1060  2       This is one of the happier events of the season.
C04 1070  1       The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical
C04 1070  9    here last night and will repeat it twice today is full
C04 1080  9    of bounce, the politicians are in fine voice, the chorines
C04 1090  7    evoke happy memories, and the Little Flower rides to
C04 1100  4    break a lance again.
C04 1100  8       I saw "Fiorello!" performed in New York by the original
C04 1110  8    cast and I think this company is every bit as good,
C04 1120  6    and perhaps better.
C04 1120  9       Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing
C04 1130  6    lacking. Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a
C04 1140  5    physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does,
C04 1150  2    but I was amazed at the way he became more and more
C04 1150 14    Fiorello as the evening progressed, until one had to
C04 1160  9    catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really
C04 1170  6    LaGuardia come back among us again.
C04 1180  1       Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben, the distraught
C04 1190  1    Republican Party district chieftain. And Paul Lipson,
C04 1190  8    as Morris, the faithful one who never gets home to
C04 1200  9    his Shirley's dinner, was fine, too.
C04 1210  3       As for the ladies, they were full of charm, and
C04 1210 13    sincerity, and deep and abiding affection for this
C04 1220  8    hurrying driving, honest, little man. Charlotte Fairchild
C04 1230  5    was excellent as the loyal Marie, who became the second
C04 1240  5    Mrs. LaGuardia, singing and acting with remarkable
C04 1250  2    conviction. Jen Nelson, as Thea, his first wife, managed
C04 1260  1    to make that short role impressive. And little Zeme
C04 1260 10    North, a Dora with real spirit and verve, was fascinating
C04 1270  8    whether she was singing of her love for Floyd, the
C04 1280  6    cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted
C04 1290  3    into garbage, or just dancing to display her exuberant
C04 1290 12    feelings.
C04 1300  1       Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual
C04 1310  1    treatment of "On the Side of the Angels" and "Politics
C04 1310 11    and Poker" were handled splendidly, and I thought Rudy
C04 1320  8    Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made "Little
C04 1330  7    Tin Box" even better than it was done by the New York
C04 1340  8    cast; all the words of its clever lyrics came through
C04 1350  4    with perfect clarity.
C04 1350  7       The party at Floyd's penthouse gave the "chorines"
C04 1360  5    a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed
C04 1370  5    routines which have become a classic choreographic
C04 1380  1    statement of the era's nonsense.
C04 1380  6       LaGuardia's multi-lingual rallies, when he is running
C04 1390  6    for Congress, are well staged, and wind up in a wild
C04 1400  7    Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater.
C04 1410  2       Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation
C04 1410  9    for himself as a successful stager of touring productions.
C04 1420  9    Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one. The
C04 1430  9    sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that
C04 1440  6    doesn't pause long in any one place, and they are devised
C04 1450  3    so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or
C04 1450 13    obtrusiveness. (Several times recently I have wondered
C04 1460  7    whether shows were being staged for the sake of the
C04 1470  8    script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle
C04 1480  4    of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes.
C04 1490  2    I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in
C04 1490 12    this "Fiorello!")
C04 1500  2       It has all been done in superb style, and the result
C04 1510  4    is a show which deserves the support of every person
C04 1510 14    hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater.
C04 1530  1       LOEW'S THEATER presents "Where the Boys are", an
C04 1540  2    MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed
C04 1550  1    by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells. The
C04 1550 11    cast: @
C04 1560  1       Since the hero, a sterling and upright fellow, is
C04 1560 10    a rich Brown senior, while two Yalies are cast as virtual
C04 1570  9    rapists, I suppose I should disqualify myself from
C04 1580  6    sitting in judgment on "Where the Boys are", but I
C04 1590  5    shall do nothing of the sort.
C04 1590 11       Instead- and not just to prove my objectivity- I
C04 1600  9    hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which
C04 1610  6    probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on
C04 1620  3    the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down
C04 1620 10    in Fort Lauderdale, and that it seems to come to grips
C04 1630 10    quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly
C04 1640  7    vexes youngsters in this age group- that is to say,
C04 1650  7    sex.
C04 1650  8       The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably
C04 1660  4    varied and healthily individual. If most of them weren't
C04 1670  1    exactly specific- well, that's the way it is in life,
C04 1670 11    I guess. But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers
C04 1680 10    who don't profess to know all the answers and are thinking
C04 1690 10    about their problems instead.
C04 1700  2       "Where the Boys Are" also has a juvenile bounce
C04 1710  1    that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy. There
C04 1710 10    are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously
C04 1720  7    funny situations- the best of the latter being a mass
C04 1730  7    impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a "mermaid"
C04 1740  3    is performing.
C04 1740  5       Most of the female faces are new, or at least not
C04 1750  6    too familiar. Dolores Hart, is charming in a leading
C04 1760  1    role, and quite believable. I was delighted with Paula
C04 1760 10    Prentiss' comedy performance, which was as fresh and
C04 1770  8    unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask. A couple
C04 1780  7    of the males made good comedy, too- Jim Hutton and
C04 1790  6    Frank Gorshin.
C04 1790  8       The only performance which was too soft for me was
C04 1800  7    that of Yvette Mimieux, but since someone had to become
C04 1810  4    the victim of despoilers, just to emphasize that such
C04 1810 13    things do happen at these fracases, I suppose this
C04 1820  9    was the attitude the part called for. I must say, however,
C04 1830  8    that I preferred the acting that had something of a
C04 1840  5    biting edge to it.
C04 1840  9       To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than
C04 1850  6    maximum violence, this view of what the boys and girls
C04 1860  4    do in the springtime before they wing north for the
C04 1860 14    Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining.
C04 1870  6       The second feature, "The Price of Silence", is a
C04 1880  7    British detective story that will talk your head off.
