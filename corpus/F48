F48 0010  1    The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch
F48 0010  9    counters not only by wise action by local community
F48 0020  7    leaders but by voluntary action following consultation
F48 0030  2    between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain
F48 0040  3    national chain stores should, of course, be applauded.
F48 0040 11    But for it to be just to attain this same result by
F48 0050 12    means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation
F48 0060  6    would require the verification of facts contrary to
F48 0070  3    those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions
F48 0080  1    in the previous illustration might be sufficiently
F48 0080  8    altered by establishing a connection between general
F48 0090  5    company practice and local practice in the South, and
F48 0100  5    by establishing such direct connection between the
F48 0110  1    practice and the economic well-being of stores located
F48 0110 10    in New York and general company policy. Then the boycott
F48 0120  8    would not be secondary, but a primary one. It would
F48 0130  7    be directed against the actual location of the unjust
F48 0140  3    policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice,
F48 0150  1    must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the
F48 0150 10    economic injury of the people directly and objectively
F48 0160  7    a part of this policy. Perhaps this would be sufficient
F48 0170  5    to justify an economic boycott of an entire national
F48 0180  2    chain in order, by threatening potential injury to
F48 0180 10    its entire economy, to effect an alteration of the
F48 0190  8    policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation.
F48 0200  6    Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating
F48 0210  4    instrument, and therefore of questionable justification.
F48 0220  1    Action located where the evil is concentrated will
F48 0220  9    prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate.
F48 0230  8    Moreover, prudence alone would indicate that, unless
F48 0240  5    the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed,
F48 0250  4    the results of direct economic action everywhere upon
F48 0260  1    national chain stores will likely be simply to give
F48 0260 10    undue advantage to local and state stores which conform
F48 0270  8    to these customs, leading to greater decentralization
F48 0280  3    and local autonomy within the company, or even (as
F48 0290  2    the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic
F48 0290 12    pressure to correct injustice) to its going out of
F48 0300  9    business in certain sections of the country (as, for
F48 0310  6    that matter, the Quakers, who once had many meetings
F48 0320  2    in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business
F48 0330  1    in that part of the country over the slavery issue,
F48 0330 11    never to recover a large number of southern adherents).
F48 0340  7       In any case, anyone who fails to make significant
F48 0350  5    distinction between primary and secondary applications
F48 0360  2    of economic pressure would in principle already have
F48 0360 10    justified that use of economic boycott as a means which
F48 0370 10    broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized
F48 0380  6    by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of
F48 0390  6    Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that
F48 0400  3    state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program
F48 0400 11    over a national TV network on which was presented
F48 0410  8    a drama showing, it seemed, a "high yellow gal" smooching
F48 0420  6    with a white man. It is true, of course, that the end
F48 0430  6    or objective of this action was different. But since
F48 0440  2    this is a world in which people disagree about ends
F48 0440 12    and goals and concerning justice and injustice, and
F48 0450  7    since, in a situation where direct action and economic
F48 0460  5    pressure are called for, the justice of the matter
F48 0470  2    has either not been clearly defined by law or the law
F48 0470 13    is not effectively present, there has to be a morality
F48 0480  9    of means applied in every case in which people take
F48 0490  7    it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other
F48 0500  3    forms of force.
F48 0500  6       the need that we not give unqualified approval to
F48 0510  3    any but a limited use of economic pressure directed
F48 0520  1    against the actual doers of injustice is clear also
F48 0520 10    in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils
F48 0530  6    seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the
F48 0540  4    use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical
F48 0550  1    violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for
F48 0550  9    diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions
F48 0560  8    of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed
F48 0570  9    by the use of more obviously brutal means. The end
F48 0580  5    or aim of the action, of course, is also important,
F48 0590  2    especially where it is not alone a matter of changing
F48 0590 12    community customs but of the use of deadly economic
F48 0600  9    power to intimidate a person from stepping forward
F48 0610  4    to claim his legal rights, e.g., against Negroes who
F48 0620  3    register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the
F48 0630  1    present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give
F48 0630 11    economic sustenance to those being despoiled, and to
F48 0640  7    legal remedies. This, however, is sufficient to show
F48 0650  5    that more or less non-violent resistance and economic
F48 0660  2    conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war
F48 0660 12    of all against all no less than if other means are
F48 0670 10    used. It is also sufficient to show the Christian and
F48 0680  6    any other champion of justice that he needs to make
F48 0690  3    sure not only that his cause is just but also that
F48 0690 14    his conduct is just, i.e., that, if economic pressure
F48 0700  8    has to be resorted to, this be applied directly against
F48 0710  7    those persons directly in the way of some salutary
F48 0720  5    change in business or institutional practices, while,
F48 0730  1    if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly
F48 0730 11    and secondarily (however inevitably) and not by deliberate
F48 0740  7    intent and direct action against them.
F48 0750  4       It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode
F48 0760  3    of action in need of justification and limitation in
F48 0760 12    Christian morality, like any other form of resistance.
F48 0770  8    The language used itself often makes very clear that
F48 0780  7    this is only another form of struggle for victory (perhaps
F48 0790  4    to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in leaders
F48 0800  2    has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom
F48 0810  1    of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in
F48 0810 11    the world today might as well make up their minds to
F48 0820  9    march with freedom or freedom is going to march over
F48 0830  6    them". The present writer certainly agrees with that
F48 0840  3    statement, and would also affirm this- in the order
F48 0840 12    of justice. However, it is also a Christian insight
F48 0850  8    to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice
F48 0860  3    it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward.
F48 0870  2    And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for
F48 0870  9    justice and freedom it does not simply surround this
F48 0880  9    with a sentimental good will. It also definitely fashions
F48 0890  7    conduct in the way explained above, and this means
F48 0900  5    far more than in the choice of non-violent means. R.
F48 0920  2    B. Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will
F48 0920 12    of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition
F48 0930 10    by the user of physical jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker
F48 0940  7    to lose his moral balance. He suddenly and unexpectedly
F48 0950  4    loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance
F48 0960  2    of most victims would render him"; and again, that
F48 0970  1    "the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous
F48 0970 10    to this object of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent,
F48 0980  8    to break his will, to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm,
F48 0990  6    and hope. In another respect it is dissimilar, for
F48 1000  5    non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only
F48 1010  2    to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer
F48 1010 13    because it is based on sounder values".
F48 1020  5       A trial of strength, however, is made quite inevitable
F48 1030  3    by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent
F48 1040  1    resistance will be convinced that his action is based
F48 1040 10    on sounder values than those of his opponent; and in
F48 1050  9    warfare with any means, men commonly disagree over
F48 1060  5    the justice of the cause. This makes necessary a morality
F48 1070  3    of means, and principles governing the conduct of resistance
F48 1080  2    whenever this is thought to be justified. The question,
F48 1090  1    then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use
F48 1090  9    of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found
F48 1100  8    in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes
F48 1110  3    the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing
F48 1120  1    him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly
F48 1120 11    regard some causes as more important than their lives;
F48 1130  8    and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed
F48 1140  6    to defeat such causes non-violently. A technique by
F48 1150  4    which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into
F48 1160  1    the very heart of a man and determine his values may
F48 1160 12    often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression.
F48 1170  5       Among Christian groups, the Mennonites have commonly
F48 1180  4    been aware more than others of the fact that the nature
F48 1190  3    of divine charity raises decisively the question of
F48 1190 11    the Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the
F48 1200 10    will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christlike
F48 1210  7    love, it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance
F48 1220  5    is quite another thing. "The primary objective of non-violence",
F48 1230  5    writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, "is not
F48 1240  3    peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather
F48 1240 12    certain desired social changes, for personal, or class,
F48 1250  8    or national advantage". Without agreeing with every
F48 1260  5    phrase in this statement, we must certainly assert
F48 1270  3    the great difference between Christian love and any
F48 1280  1    form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite
F48 1280 11    position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must
F48 1290  8    first justify and then determine the moral principles
F48 1300  4    limiting resistance. These principles we have now set
F48 1310  4    forth. Economy in the use of power needs not only to
F48 1320  1    be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is
F48 1320 10    done it will be found that the principles governing
F48 1330  7    Christian resistance cut across the distinction between
F48 1340  4    violent and non-violent means, and apply to both alike,
F48 1350  3    justifying either on occasion and always limiting either
F48 1350 11    action. Economy in the use of power means more than
F48 1360 10    inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent
F48 1380  6    and upon the injustice opposed. That would amount to
F48 1390  5    calculating the means and justifying them wholly in
F48 1400  2    terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.
F48 1400 10    There must also be additional and more fundamental
F48 1410  8    discrimination in the use of means of resistance, violent
F48 1420  6    or non-violent. The justification in Christian conscience
F48 1430  4    of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down
F48 1440  2    its limitation- in the distinction between the persons
F48 1440 10    against whom pressure is primarily directed, those
F48 1450  7    upon whom it may be permitted also to fall, and those
F48 1460  6    who may never be directly repressed for the sake even
F48 1470  3    of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic
F48 1480  1    withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee,
F48 1480  8    from trading in the center city, for example, was clearly
F48 1490  9    justified, since these distinctions do not require
F48 1500  5    that only people subjectively guilty be singled out.
F48 1510  3       We may now take up for consideration a hard case
F48 1520  1    which seems to require either no action employing economic
F48 1520 10    pressure or else action that would seem to violate
F48 1530  9    the principles set forth above. There may be instances
F48 1540  5    in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken
F48 1550  1    at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination
F48 1560  1    against a whole people. An excellent article was published
F48 1560 10    recently in the journal of the Church Peace Union by
F48 1570  9    a South African journalist on the inhuman economic
F48 1580  5    conditions of the blacks in South Africa, amounting
F48 1590  2    to virtual slavery, and the economic complicity of
F48 1590 10    both the government and the people of the United States
F48 1600 10    in these conditions. "... Billions of American dollars,
F48 1610  6    not only from capital investors but also from the pockets
F48 1620  6    of U. S. taxpayers", this author states, "are being
F48 1630  4    poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated
F48 1640  2    to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost
F48 1640 10    diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color
F48 1650  8    of whose skins happens not to be white". Both the conditions
F48 1660  8    and the complicity are documented in considerable detail.
F48 1670  4    This leads to the conclusion that "the fact is inescapable
F48 1680  4    that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid
F48 1690  2    shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic
F48 1700  1    boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord,
F48 1700 11    it seems, with the moral conscience of America, not
F48 1710  7    to be denied because we also as a people have widespread
F48 1720  5    injustice in the relations of the races in our own
F48 1730  2    country, but also in accord with our law, U.S. Code
F48 1730 12    Title 19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation
F48 1740  8    of goods made by forced or convict labor. Not only
F48 1750  6    should this provision be enforced but other economic
F48 1760  3    and political actions might be taken which, this author
F48 1780  1    believes, "must surely be supported by every American
F48 1780  9    who values the freedom that has been won for him and
F48 1790  9    whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in
F48 1800  5    his account books that he can willingly and knowingly
F48 1810  1    contribute to the enslavement of another nation".
