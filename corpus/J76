J76 0010  1       Within only a few years, foamed plastics materials
J76 0010  9    have managed to grow into an integral, and important,
J76 0020  8    phase of the plastics industry- and the end is still
J76 0030  8    not yet in sight. Urethane foam, as only one example,
J76 0040  3    was only introduced commercially in this country in
J76 0040 11    1955. Yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million
J76 0050  9    lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million
J76 0060  8    lb. by 1964. Many of the other foamed plastics, particularly
J76 0070  4    the styrenes, show similar growth potential. And there
J76 0080  3    are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated.
J76 0090  2    As this issue goes to press, for example, one manufacturer
J76 0100  1    has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy
J76 0100  9    and impact strength; another reports that a cellular
J76 0110  6    polypropylene, primarily for use in wire coating applications,
J76 0120  5    is being investigated.
J76 0120  8       On the following pages, each of the major commercial
J76 0130  8    foamed plastics is described in detail, as to properties,
J76 0140  6    applications, and methods of processing.
J76 0150  1       It might be well to point out, however, some of
J76 0150 11    the newer developments that have taken place within
J76 0160  7    the past few months which might have a bearing on the
J76 0170  7    future of the various foamed plastics involved. In
J76 0180  2    urethane foams, for example, there has been a definite
J76 0180 11    trend toward the polyether-type materials (which are
J76 0190  8    now available in two-component rigid foam systems)
J76 0200  4    and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding.
J76 0210  2    Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on
J76 0210 10    formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades
J76 0220  7    of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the
J76 0230  6    burgeoning building markets. Urethane foam as an insulator
J76 0240  5    is also coming in for a good deal of attention. In
J76 0250  2    one outstanding example, Whirlpool Corp. found that
J76 0250  9    by switching to urethane foam insulation, they could
J76 0260  7    increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators
J76 0270  4    to make them competitive with electric models. Much
J76 0280  2    interest has also been expressed in new techniques
J76 0280 10    for processing the urethane foams, including spraying,
J76 0290  6    frothing, and molding (see article, p. 391 for details).
J76 0300  6    And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment
J76 0310  5    interlining, new adhesives and new methods of laminating
J76 0320  1    foam to a substrate have been developed.
J76 0320  8       New techniques for automatic molding of expandable
J76 0330  6    styrene beads have helped boost that particular material
J76 0340  4    into a number of new consumer applications, including
J76 0350  1    picnic chests, beverage coolers, flower pots, and flotation-type
J76 0360  1    swimming toys. Two other end-use areas which contributed
J76 0360 10    to expandable styrene's growth during the year were
J76 0370  7    packaging (molded inserts replacing complicated cardboard
J76 0380  4    units) and foamed-core building panels. Extruded expandable
J76 0390  3    styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive price-wise
J76 0400  3    with paper- also showed much potential, particularly
J76 0410  1    for packaging. Sandwich panels for building utility
J76 0410  8    shelters that consist of kraft paper skins and rigid
J76 0420  8    styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction
J76 0430  5    field.
J76 0430  6       In vinyl foam, the big news was the development
J76 0440  4    of techniques for coating fabrics with the material
J76 0450  1    (for details, see P. 395). Better "hand", a more luxurious
J76 0460  1    feel, and better insulating properties were claimed
J76 0460  8    to be the result. Several companies also saw possibilities
J76 0470  6    in using the technique for extruding or molding vinyl
J76 0480  5    products with a slight cellular core that would reduce
J76 0490  3    costs yet would not affect physical properties of the
J76 0490 12    end product to any great extent.
J76 0500  6       Readers interested in additional information on
J76 0510  3    foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing
J76 0520  1    in the Technical Data section and to the list of references
J76 0520 12    which appears below.
J76 0530  3    #URETHANE FOAMS#
J76 0530  5    @ Since the mid 1950s, when urethane foam first made
J76 0540  5    its appearance in the American market, growth has been
J76 0550  3    little short of fantastic. Present estimates are that
J76 0550 11    production topped the 100-million-lb. mark in 1960
J76 0560  9    (85 to 90 million lb. for flexible, 10 or 11 million
J76 0570  8    lb. for rigid); by 1965, production may range from
J76 0580  4    200 to 350 million lb. for flexible and from 115 to
J76 0590  2    150 million lb. for rigid. The markets that have started
J76 0590 12    to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem
J76 0600 12    to justify the expectations. Furniture upholstery,
J76 0610  3    as just one example, can easily take millions of pounds;
J76 0620  3    foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation
J76 0630  1    by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for
J76 0630 11    garment interlining is only now getting off the ground,
J76 0640  9    with volume potential in the offing.
J76 0650  4    _BASIC CHEMISTRY_
J76 0650  6       Urethane foams are, basically, reaction products
J76 0660  3    of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates (usually
J76 0670  1    tolylene diisocyanate). Blowing can be either one of
J76 0670  9    two types- carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction
J76 0680 10    of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blowing
J76 0690  4    through the use of a low-boiling liquid such as a fluorinated
J76 0700  5    hydrocarbon.
J76 0700  6       The most important factor in determining what properties
J76 0710  5    the end-product will have is quite naturally the type
J76 0720  3    of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production.
J76 0730  1    Originally, the main types used were various compositions
J76 0730  9    of polyesters. These are still in wide use today, particularly
J76 0740  9    in semi-rigid formulations, for such applications as
J76 0750  6    cores for sandwich-type structural panels, foamed-in-place
J76 0760  5    insulation, automotive safety padding, arm rests, etc.
J76 0770  3    More recently, polyethers- again in varied compositions,
J76 0780  1    molecular weights, and branching- have come into use
J76 0780  9    at first for the flexible foams, just lately for the
J76 0790  9    rigids. The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible
J76 0800  6    urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired
J76 0810  4    in cushioning.
J76 0810  6       Although the first polyether foams on the market
J76 0820  4    had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method,
J76 0830  1    today, thanks to new catalysts, they can be produced
J76 0830 10    by a one-shot technique. It is possible that the polyether
J76 0840  8    foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost
J76 0850  8    molds with more intricate contours and with superior
J76 0860  4    properties to latex foam.
J76 0860  8       The polyester urethane foam is generally produced
J76 0870  5    with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether group generally
J76 0880  3    consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol
J76 0890  1    or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol.
J76 0900  1    _ONE SHOT VS. PREPOLYMER_
J76 0900  2       In the prepolymer system, the isocyanate and resin
J76 0900 10    are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs. The foaming
J76 0910  9    can be accomplished at some future time at a different
J76 0920  8    location by the addition of the correct proportion
J76 0930  3    of catalyst in solution. In one-shot, the isocyanate,
J76 0940  1    polyester or polyether resin, catalyst, and other additives
J76 0940  9    are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately.
J76 0950  9    Basically, this means that simpler processing equipment
J76 0960  5    (the mixture has good flowing characteristics) and
J76 0970  2    less external heat (the foaming reaction is exothermic
J76 0980  1    and develops internal heat) are required in one-shot
J76 0980 10    foaming, although, at the same time, the problems of
J76 0990  8    controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are
J76 1000  5    critical ones.
J76 1000  7    _PROPERTIES_
J76 1000  8       Most commercial uses of urethane foams require densities
J76 1010  7    between 2 and 30 lb./cu. ft. for rigid foams, between
J76 1020  6    1 and 3 lb./cu. ft. for flexible foams. This latter
J76 1030  4    figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average
J76 1040  1    of 5.5 lb./cu. ft. in commercial grades.
J76 1050  1    _COMPRESSION STRENGTH:_
J76 1050  1       Graph in Fig. 1, p. 392, indicates how the ratio
J76 1050 11    of compressive strength to density varies as the latter
J76 1060  9    is increased or decreased. The single curve line represents
J76 1070  7    a specific formulation in a test example. By varying
J76 1080  6    the formula, this curve may be moved forward or backward
J76 1090  3    along the coordinates to produce any desired compression
J76 1100  1    strength/density ratio.
J76 1110  1    _THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE:_
J76 1110  1       In flexible urethane foams, we are referring to
J76 1110  9    the range between the highest and lowest temperatures
J76 1120  7    under which the materials' primary performance remains
J76 1130  4    functionally useful. In temperature resistance, this
J76 1140  3    quality is usually related to specific properties,
J76 1150  1    e.g., flexural, tensile strengths, etc. Thermal conductivity
J76 1150  8    is directly traceable to the material's porous, air-cell
J76 1160  9    construction which effectively traps air or a gas in
J76 1170  9    the maze of minute bubbles which forms its composition.
J76 1180  4    These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal
J76 1190  2    barriers. The K factor, a term used to denote the
J76 1190 12    rate of heat transmission through a material (B.t.u./sq.
J76 1200  8    ft. of material/hr./`F./in. of thickness) ranges from
J76 1210  7    0.24 to 0.28 for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12
J76 1220  8    to 0.16 for rigid urethane foams, depending upon the
J76 1230  5    formulation, density, cell size, and nature of blowing
J76 1240  3    agents used. Table I, p. 394, shows a comparison
J76 1240 12    of K factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating
J76 1250 10    materials in common use, including two different types
J76 1260  8    of rigid urethane foam.
J76 1270  1    _FLEXURAL STRENGTH:_
J76 1270  2       This term refers to the ability of a material to
J76 1280  2    resist bending stress and is determined by measuring
J76 1280 10    the load required to cause failure by bending. The
J76 1290  7    higher-density urethane semi-rigid foams usually have
J76 1300  4    stronger flex fatigue resistance, i.e., the 12 lb./cu.
J76 1310  3    ft. foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3
J76 1320  2    lb./cu. ft. density. Note that flexural strength is
J76 1320 10    not always improved by simply increasing the density,
J76 1330  7    nor is the change always proportional from one formulation
J76 1340  5    to another. Where flexural strength is an important
J76 1350  4    factor, be sure that your urethane foam processor is
J76 1360  1    aware of it.
J76 1360  4    _TENSILE STRENGTH:_
J76 1360  6       This property refers to the greatest longitudinal
J76 1370  2    stress or tension a material can endure without tearing
J76 1380  1    apart. Like compression strength of urethane foams,
J76 1380  8    it has a direct relationship to formulation. Exceptional
J76 1390  5    tensile strength is another of urethane foam's strong
J76 1400  5    features. Figure 2, above, shows the aging properties
J76 1410  3    of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change
J76 1420  1    in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet
J76 1420  9    light.
J76 1430  1    _PROCESSING URETHANES_
J76 1430  2       There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane
J76 1440  1    product. The foam can be made into slab stock and cut
J76 1440 12    to shape, it can be molded, it can be poured-in-place,
J76 1450 10    it can be applied by spray guns, etc.
J76 1460  3       Slab stock is still one of the most important forms
J76 1470  1    of urethane end-product in use today. Basically, the
J76 1470 10    foam machines that produce such stock consist of two
J76 1480  8    or more pumping units, a variable mixer, a nozzle carriage
J76 1490  5    assembly, and, in many cases, a conveyor belt to transport
J76 1500  4    and contain the liquid during the reaction process
J76 1510  1    and until it solidifies into foam. The ingredients
J76 1510  9    are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer
J76 1520  8    at a predetermined rate. The mixing head moves back
J76 1530  4    and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle.
J76 1540  1    It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action
J76 1540 11    to be completed and after a short cure, the material
J76 1550  8    can be cut into lengths as desired.
J76 1560  1       Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters
J76 1560 11    to fabricate the slab stock into finished products.
J76 1570  7    Profile cutting machines are available which can split
J76 1580  6    foam to any desired thickness and produce sine, triangle,
J76 1590  3    trapezoid, and other profiles in variable heights,
J76 1600  1    dimensions, etc. The convoluted sheets can be combined
J76 1600  9    to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather
J76 1610  6    than chemically. Also available is a slitter which
J76 1620  6    "peels" the inside of a folded block of foam and can
J76 1630  5    be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd. in
J76 1640  1    length, down to 1/16 in. thick.
J76 1640  7       The low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies
J76 1650  4    for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety
J76 1660  2    of shapes, dimensions, and contours that can be tailor-made
J76 1660 12    to customer requirements has made the technique useful
J76 1670  8    for producing case liners, materials handling containers,
J76 1680  5    packaging and cushioning devices, and such novelties
J76 1690  4    as soap dishes, toys, head rests, arch supports, and
J76 1700  2    gas pedal covers.
J76 1700  5    _MOLDING_
J76 1700  6       Although slab stock appeared first, it soon became
J76 1710  5    apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular
J76 1720  2    shapes, crowned contours, or rounded edges, the cutting
J76 1720 10    of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process.
J76 1730  9    Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion
J76 1740  7    manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the
J76 1750  3    established cushion market.
J76 1750  6       The closed molding of flexible urethane foams has
J76 1760  6    been a problem ever since the introduction of the material
J76 1770  4    (molding in open molds was more feasible). Satisfactory
J76 1780  2    methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether
J76 1790  1    foams were never fully achieved. Closed molding generally
J76 1790  9    resulted in parts weighing more (because of higher
J76 1800  8    density) than parts fabricated from free-blown foams.
J76 1810  5    This counteracted the gain from having no scrap loss.
J76 1820  2    In addition, there were difficulties with the flow
J76 1820 10    and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface,
J76 1830  9    trouble with lack of gel strength in the rising foam,
J76 1840  7    and problems of splits. The introduction of one-shot
J76 1850  4    polyether foam systems, aided by the development of
J76 1860  1    new catalysts, helped to alleviate some of the problems
J76 1860 10    of closed molding. While there are still many bugs
J76 1870  7    to be ironed out, the technique is fast developing.
J76 1880  4    _OTHER TECHNIQUES_
J76 1880  6       Simple systems are available that make it possible
J76 1890  5    for urethane foam components to be poured, pumped,
J76 1900  1    etc., into a void where they foam up to fill the void.
J76 1900 13    In a typical application- the making of rigid urethane
J76 1910  8    foam sandwich panels- an amount of foam mixture calculated
J76 1920  9    to expand 10 to 20% more than the volume of the panel
J76 1930  7    is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel
J76 1940  4    is locked in place by a jig.
