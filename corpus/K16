K16 0010  1       The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky.
K16 0010 13    The two in the bed knew each other as old people know
K16 0020 10    the partners with whom they have shared the same bed
K16 0030  6    for many years, and they needed to say no more. The
K16 0040  3    things left unsaid they both felt deeply, and with
K16 0040 12    a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows.
K16 0050  8    Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer,
K16 0060  6    and in the smell of scented candlewick, the comforting
K16 0070  3    awareness of each other's bodies, the retained pattern
K16 0080  1    of dancers and guests remembered, their minds grew
K16 0080  9    numb and then empty of images. They slept- Mynheer
K16 0090  6    with a marvelously high-pitched snoring, the damn seahorse
K16 0100  5    ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table.
K16 0110  1    ##
K16 0110  2    In the ballroom below, the dark had given way to moonlight
K16 0120  1    coming in through the bank of French windows. It was
K16 0120 11    a delayed moon, but now the sky had cleared of scudding
K16 0130  9    black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky. Martha
K16 0140  6    Schuyler, old, slow, careful of foot, came down the
K16 0150  3    great staircase, dressed in her best lace-drawn black
K16 0150 12    silk, her jeweled shoe buckles held forward.
K16 0160  7       "Well, I'm here at last", she said, addressing the
K16 0170  7    old portraits on the walls. "I don't hear the music.
K16 0180  5    I am getting deaf, I must admit it".
K16 0190  1       She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted
K16 0190 12    steps that led down to it. "Where is everyone? I say,
K16 0200 10    where is everyone? Peter, you lummox, you've forgot
K16 0210  6    to order the musicians".
K16 0220  1       She stood there, a large old woman, smiling at the
K16 0220 10    things she would say to him in the morning, this big
K16 0230  9    foolish baby of a son. There were times now, like this,
K16 0240  5    when she lost control of the time count and moved freely
K16 0250  2    back and forth into three generations. Was it a birthday
K16 0250 12    ball? When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen?
K16 0260  9    Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big
K16 0270 10    house, a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near
K16 0280  5    Albany, from Rensselaerwyck. And this handsome booby,
K16 0290  2    staring and sweating, was he her bridegroom?
K16 0290  9       Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes
K16 0300 11    closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around
K16 0310  7    the ballroom.
K16 0310  9    ##
K16 0310 10    David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits
K16 0320  7    of his flesh. He had ridden hard from Boston, and he
K16 0330  6    was not used to horseback. Now, driving the horse and
K16 0340  3    sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler, he felt as if
K16 0340 12    every bone was topped by burning oil and that every
K16 0350 10    muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his
K16 0360  6    big body helpless and unable to move.
K16 0370  1       The road leading south along the river was shaded
K16 0370 10    with old trees, and in the moonlight the silvery landscape
K16 0380  8    was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather
K16 0390  5    than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories.
K16 0400  2    He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray
K16 0400 13    horse and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole
K16 0410 11    and came out with a jolt and went on. He would cross
K16 0420  9    to Manhattan, to Harlem Heights, before morning. There
K16 0430  4    a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty.
K16 0440  4    He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches
K16 0450  1    with their electrifying news. And he would sleep, sleep,
K16 0450 10    and never think of roads and horses' sore haunches,
K16 0460  8    of colonial wars.
K16 0470  1       Strange how everything here fitted back into his
K16 0470  9    life, even if he had been away so long. Mynheer, Sir
K16 0480  7    Francis, the valley society, the very smell of the
K16 0490  4    river on his right purling along to the bay past fish
K16 0500  1    weirs and rocks, and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched
K16 0500 12    road. A mist was walking on the water, white as cotton,
K16 0510 10    but with a blending and merging grace.
K16 0520  4       Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at
K16 0530  2    a crossroads. David reached for the pair of pistols
K16 0530 11    in the saddlebags at his feet. He pulled out one of
K16 0540  9    them and cocked it. A strange wood creature came floating
K16 0550  5    up from a patch of berry bushes. It was a grotesque
K16 0560  3    hen, five or six feet tall. It had the features of
K16 0560 14    a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers. It ran,
K16 0570  9    this apocalyptic beast, on two thin legs, and its wings-
K16 0580  8    were they feathered arms?- flapped as it ran. Its groin
K16 0590  9    was bloody. Black strips of skin hung from it.
K16 0600  3       The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared
K16 0600 12    its nostrils. David took a firm hand with it. The creature
K16 0610 11    in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes,
K16 0620  9    glazed with an insane fear. The ungainly bird thing
K16 0630  5    ran away, and to David its croaking sounded like the
K16 0640  3    crowing of a tormented rooster. Then it was gone. He
K16 0640 13    drove on, wary and shaken. The Sons were out tonight.
K16 0650 10    #CHAPTER 10#
K16 0650 12    New York lay bleaching in the summer sun, and the morning
K16 0660 11    fish hawk, flying in the heated air, saw below him
K16 0670  8    the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island. It was
K16 0680  4    thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid
K16 0690  3    out into pig-infested streets, mostly around the Battery,
K16 0690 12    going bravely north to Wall Street, but giving up and
K16 0700 10    becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights.
K16 0710  9    From there it looked across at Westchester County and
K16 0720  5    the Hudson River where the manor houses, estates, and
K16 0730  3    big farms of the original (non-Indian) landowners began.
K16 0740  2       On the east side of the island of Manhattan the
K16 0740 12    indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected
K16 0750  8    New York Bay with Long Island Sound. On the western
K16 0760  6    tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights. It commanded
K16 0770  4    a view over Manhattan and the harbor. A fringe of housing
K16 0780  5    and gardens bearded the top of the heights, and behind
K16 0790  2    it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields.
K16 0790 11    Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences, and there
K16 0800  9    were grazing cattle. On the shores north and south,
K16 0810  6    the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- lived along
K16 0820  5    the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier
K16 0830  1    of sand, Fire Island.
K16 0830  5       The morning hawk, hungry for any eatable, killable,
K16 0840  2    digestible item, kept his eyes on the ring of anchored
K16 0840 12    ships that lay off the shores in the bay, sheltered
K16 0850 10    by the Jersey inlets. They often threw tidbits overboard.
K16 0860  6    The larger ships were near Paulus Hook, already being
K16 0870  4    called, by a few, Jersey City. These were the ships
K16 0880  3    of His Majesty's Navy, herding the hulks of the East
K16 0890  1    Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the
K16 0890 10    loyalists. The news of battle on Breed's Hill had already
K16 0900  9    seeped through, and New York itself was now left in
K16 0910  7    the hands of the local Provincial Congress. The fish
K16 0920  3    hawk, his wings not moving, circled and glided lower.
K16 0930  1    The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer
K16 0930 11    to him, the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately
K16 0940  7    painted yellow and black, the bronze cannon at the
K16 0950  4    ports. The captain's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being
K16 0960  3    rowed to H.M.S. Neptune.
K16 0960  7    ##
K16 0960  8    On shore "the freed slaves to despotism"- the town
K16 0970  8    dwellers- watched the ships and waited. The chevaux
K16 0980  7    de frise, those sharp stakes and barriers around the
K16 0990  5    fort at the Battery, pointed to a conflict between
K16 1000  1    the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as
K16 1000 11    the tide came in. Across the bay the Palisades were
K16 1010  8    heavy in green timber; their rock paths led down to
K16 1020  6    the Hudson. Below in the open bay facing Manhattan
K16 1030  1    was Staten Island, gritty with clam shells and mud
K16 1030 10    flats behind which nested farms, cattle barns, and
K16 1040  7    berry thickets. Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County,
K16 1050  5    past the white church at Fishkill, past Verplanck's
K16 1060  3    Point on the east bank of the Hudson, to the white
K16 1070  1    salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there
K16 1070 10    was a watching and an activity of preparing for something
K16 1080  8    explosive to happen. Today, tomorrow, six months, even
K16 1090  6    perhaps a year ...
K16 1090 10       The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight. The
K16 1100 10    British ships rolled at anchor, sent out picket boats
K16 1110  6    and waited for orders from London. Waited for more
K16 1120  3    ships, more lobster-backed infantry, and asked what
K16 1130  1    was to be done with a war of rebellion?
K16 1130 10    ##
K16 1130 11    David Cortlandt, having slept away a day and a night,
K16 1140  8    came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River
K16 1150  4    near Spuyten Duyvil. He looked out through windowpanes
K16 1160  1    turned a faint violet by sun and weather, looked out
K16 1160 11    at King's Bridge toward Westchester. The road seemed
K16 1170  7    animated with a few more wagons than usual; a carriage
K16 1180  6    raising up the choking June dust, and beyond, in a
K16 1190  5    meadow, a local militia company drilling with muskets,
K16 1200  1    Kentuck' rifles, every kind of horse pistol, old sword,
K16 1200 10    or cutlass.
K16 1210  1       The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded
K16 1210 11    David's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt
K16 1220 10    again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle
K16 1230  6    odyssey from Boston. Pensive, introspective, he ached.
K16 1240  3    He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people
K16 1250  2    and had slept. Now there was more to do. Orders not
K16 1250 13    written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial
K16 1260  9    government. He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck.
K16 1270  5       From the saddlebags, hung on a Hitchcock chair,
K16 1280  4    David took out a good English razor, a present from
K16 1290  1    John Hunter. He found tepid water in a pitcher and
K16 1290 11    a last bit of soap, and he lathered his face and stood
K16 1300  9    stropping the razor on his broad leather belt, its
K16 1310  5    buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost ... He hoped
K16 1320  3    he was free of self-deception.
K16 1320  9       Here he was, suddenly caught up in the delirium
K16 1330  6    of a war, in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories.
K16 1340  3    There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon,
K16 1350  1    but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge
K16 1350 11    merely for war. David Cortlandt had certain psychic
K16 1360  6    intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what
K16 1370  5    it appeared on the surface. He knew that many were
K16 1380  1    using it for their own ends. But it did not matter.
K16 1380 12    He stropped the razor slowly; what mattered was that
K16 1390  7    a new concept of Americans was being born. That some
K16 1400  5    men did not want it he could understand. The moral
K16 1410  2    aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their
K16 1410 11    ledgers. Yet some, like Morris Manderscheid, would
K16 1420  7    bankrupt themselves for the new ideas. Unique circumstances
K16 1430  6    would test us all, he decided. Injury and ingratitude
K16 1440  3    would occur. No doubt John Hancock would do well now;
K16 1450  2    war was a smugglers' heaven. And what of that poor
K16 1450 12    tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road
K16 1460 10    driving down from Schuyler's? Things like that would
K16 1470  5    increase rather than be done away with. One had to
K16 1480  5    believe in final events or one was stranded in the
K16 1480 15    abyss of nothing. He saw with John Hunter now that
K16 1490 10    the perfectability of man was a dream. Life was a short
K16 1500 10    play of tenebrous shadows. David began to shave with
K16 1510  5    great sweeping strokes.
K16 1510  8       Time plays an essential part in our mortality, and
K16 1520  7    suddenly for no reason he could imagine (or admit)
K16 1530  3    the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable,
K16 1540  1    so lusty, so full of nuances of pleasure and joy. He
K16 1540 12    drove sensual patterns off, carefully shaving his long
K16 1550  7    upper lip. It is harder, he muttered, to meditate on
K16 1560  6    man (or woman) than on God.
K16 1560 12       David finished shaving, washed his face clean of
K16 1570  8    lather, and combed and retied his hair. He was proud
K16 1580  7    that he had never worn a wig. More and more of the
K16 1590  4    colonials were wearing their own hair and not using
K16 1590 13    powder. He felt cheerful again, refreshed; presentable
K16 1600  7    in his wide-cut brown suit, the well-made riding boots.
K16 1610  7       It is so easy to falsify sentiment ... In the meadow
K16 1620  6    below, militia officers shouted at their men and on
K16 1630  4    King's Bridge two boys sat fishing. The future would
K16 1640  1    happen; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too
K16 1640 12    much. A man could be tossed outside the dimension of
K16 1650  7    time by a stray bullet these days. He began to pack
K16 1660  5    the saddlebags. And all this too shall pass away: it
K16 1670  3    came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a
K16 1670 15    church service when he was a boy- yes, in a white church
K16 1680 12    with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson
K16 1690  6    Valley, where a feeling of plenitude was normal in
K16 1700  4    those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires.
