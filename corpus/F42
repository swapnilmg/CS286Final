F42 0010  1    Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most
F42 0010 10    circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent,
F42 0020  7    who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence,
F42 0030  6    injustice, or brutality. I myself have witnessed and
F42 0040  4    endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers
F42 0050  1    also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And
F42 0050 11    this is not, perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's
F42 0060  7    very complex attitude toward black policemen, nor the
F42 0070  5    reasons, according to Harlem, that they are nearly
F42 0080  3    all downtown.)
F42 0080  5       It is hard, on the other hand, to blame the policeman,
F42 0090  3    blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably innocent,
F42 0100  2    for being such a perfect representative of the people
F42 0100 11    he serves. He, too, believes in good intentions and
F42 0110  8    is astounded and offended when they are not taken for
F42 0120  7    the deed. He has never, himself, done anything for
F42 0130  3    which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is
F42 0140  1    facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly
F42 0140  9    see him dead, and he knows it. There is no way for
F42 0150  8    him not to know it: there are few things under heaven
F42 0160  3    more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt
F42 0170  1    and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore,
F42 0170 11    like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country;
F42 0180  9    which is precisely what, and where, he is, and is the
F42 0190  9    reason he walks in twos and threes. And he is not the
F42 0200  6    only one who knows why he is always in company: the
F42 0210  2    people who are watching him know why, too. Any street
F42 0210 12    meeting, sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues
F42 0220  9    uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden
F42 0230  6    the cruelty and injustice of the white domination.
F42 0240  2    And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid
F42 0240 11    and jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination.
F42 0250 10    The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner
F42 0260  7    finds himself at the very center of the revolution
F42 0270  4    now occurring in the world. He is not prepared for
F42 0280  2    it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much
F42 0280 11    more to the point, he is exposed, as few white people
F42 0290  9    are, to the anguish of the black people around him.
F42 0300  5    Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain
F42 0310  2    of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid
F42 0310 11    observing that some of the children, in spite of their
F42 0320 10    color, remind him of children he has known and loved,
F42 0330  7    perhaps even of his own children. He knows that he
F42 0340  4    certainly does not want his children living this way.
F42 0350  2    He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction:
F42 0350 12    into a callousness which very shortly becomes second
F42 0360  8    nature. He becomes more callous, the population becomes
F42 0370  5    more hostile, the situation grows more tense, and the
F42 0380  5    police force is increased. One day, to everyone's astonishment,
F42 0390  2    someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything
F42 0400  1    blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood
F42 0400 11    congealed, editorials, speeches, and civil-rights commissions
F42 0410  6    are loud in the land, demanding to know what happened.
F42 0420  5    What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like
F42 0430  4    men.
F42 0430  5       Negroes want to be treated like men: a perfectly
F42 0440  3    straightforward statement, containing only seven words.
F42 0450  1    People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare,
F42 0450  8    Marx, Freud, and the Bible find this statement utterly
F42 0460  8    impenetrable. The idea seems to threaten profound,
F42 0470  4    barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic paralyzes
F42 0480  2    their features, as though they found themselves trapped
F42 0480 10    on the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe
F42 0490 12    to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions
F42 0500  5    among Negroes in the South. My recital disturbed him
F42 0510  5    and made him indignant; and he asked me in perfect
F42 0520  3    innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South
F42 0530  1    move North"? I tried to explain what has happened,
F42 0530 10    unfailingly, whenever a significant body of Negroes
F42 0540  7    move North. They do not escape Jim Crow: they merely
F42 0550  6    encounter another, not-less-deadly variety. They do
F42 0560  4    not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; they
F42 0570  2    do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure
F42 0580  1    within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand,
F42 0580 10    and this expansion is always violent. White people
F42 0590  6    hold the line as long as they can, and in as many ways
F42 0600  6    as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical violence.
F42 0610  2    But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto
F42 0610 11    from the rest of the world falls into the hands of
F42 0620 11    the ghetto. The white people fall back bitterly before
F42 0630  6    the black horde; the landlords make a tidy profit by
F42 0640  5    raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but
F42 0650  1    dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been
F42 0650 10    a neighborhood turns into a "turf". This is precisely
F42 0660  8    what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their
F42 0670  5    thousands- and the bitterness thus caused is, as I
F42 0680  4    write, being fought out all up and down those streets.
F42 0680 14       Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury.
F42 0690  8    They seem to feel that because they fought on the right
F42 0700 10    side during the Civil War, and won, they have earned
F42 0710  7    the right merely to deplore what is going on in the
F42 0720  4    South, without taking any responsibility for it; and
F42 0730  1    that they can ignore what is happening in Northern
F42 0730 10    cities because what is happening in Little Rock or
F42 0740  7    Birmingham is worse. Well, in the first place, it is
F42 0750  5    not possible for anyone who has not endured both to
F42 0760  2    know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the
F42 0760 12    South and white Southerners, because "At least there,
F42 0770  7    you haven't got to play any guessing games"! The guessing
F42 0780  7    games referred to have driven more than one Negro into
F42 0790  6    the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the river. I know
F42 0800  4    another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with
F42 0810  1    conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South
F42 0810 10    is the spirit of America". He was born in the North
F42 0820  9    and did his military training in the South. He did
F42 0830  6    not, as far as I can gather, find the South "worse";
F42 0840  2    he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the
F42 0850  1    second place, though, even if Birmingham is worse,
F42 0850  9    no doubt Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several
F42 0860  8    miles, and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that
F42 0870  8    ever happened in the entire history of the world. The
F42 0880  5    world has never lacked for horrifying examples; but
F42 0890  2    I do not believe that these examples are meant to be
F42 0890 13    used as justification for our own crimes. This perpetual
F42 0900  7    justification empties the heart of all human feeling.
F42 0910  7    The emptier our hearts become, the greater will be
F42 0920  3    our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly
F42 0930  1    backward region, but a part of this country, and what
F42 0930 11    happens there concerns every one of us.
F42 0940  7       As far as the color problem is concerned, there
F42 0950  4    is but one great difference between the Southern white
F42 0960  2    and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically
F42 0960  9    and in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved
F42 0970 13    black people and they loved him. Historically, the
F42 0980  6    flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War.
F42 0990  5    Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual coming of
F42 1000  3    age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos
F42 1000 10    are set up between himself and his past. Everything,
F42 1010  8    thereafter, is permitted him except the love he remembers
F42 1020  7    and has never ceased to need. The resulting, indescribable
F42 1030  2    torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis
F42 1040  2    of the Southern hysteria.
F42 1040  6       None of this is true for the Northerner. Negroes
F42 1050  3    represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps,
F42 1060  1    the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners
F42 1070  1    see them all the time. Northerners never think about
F42 1070 10    them whereas Southerners are never really thinking
F42 1080  5    of anything else. Negroes are, therefore, ignored in
F42 1090  4    the North and are under surveillance in the South,
F42 1100  1    and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner
F42 1100 10    nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply
F42 1110 11    as a man. It seems to be indispensable to the national
F42 1120  7    self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as
F42 1130  4    a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many
F42 1140  1    Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year
F42 1140  7    and how few, comparatively, were lynched), or as a
F42 1160  6    victim (in which case we are promised that he will
F42 1170  4    never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our
F42 1180  1    kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the
F42 1180 12    South will not change- cannot change- until the North
F42 1190  8    changes. The country will not change until it re-examines
F42 1200  7    itself and discovers what it really means by freedom.
F42 1210  4    In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness
F42 1220  1    is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and
F42 1220  9    the world shrinks around us.
F42 1230  3       It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot
F42 1240  2    deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's
F42 1240 10    own: in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself.
F42 1250 10    Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we,
F42 1260  8    this nation, have become.
F42 1260 12    #4. EAST RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM
F42 1270  8    HARLEM#
F42 1280  1       THE FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U.N.
F42 1280  9    while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked
F42 1290  7    and baffled most white Americans. Stevenson's speech,
F42 1300  4    and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery, were
F42 1310  5    both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the day
F42 1320  2    before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the
F42 1320 10    course of his address, that the United States was "against"
F42 1330  9    colonialism. God knows what the African nations, who
F42 1340  7    hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were
F42 1350  6    thinking- they may, for example, have been thinking
F42 1360  3    of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom
F42 1370  2    was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly
F42 1370 13    accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery
F42 1380  9    were thinking. I had intended to be there myself. It
F42 1390  7    was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death.
F42 1400  4    I was curious about the impact of this political assassination
F42 1410  2    on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured
F42 1420  1    the popular imagination there. I was curious to know
F42 1420 10    if Lumumba's death, which is surely among the most
F42 1430  8    sinister of recent events, would elicit from "our"
F42 1440  5    side anything more than the usual, well-meaning rhetoric.
F42 1450  2    And I was curious about the African reaction.
F42 1460  1       However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being
F42 1460 10    in the U.N. gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the
F42 1470 10    eyes of most Americans, would have been merely a pawn
F42 1480  7    in the hands of the Communists. The climate and the
F42 1490  4    events of the last decade, and the steady pressure
F42 1490 13    of the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another
F42 1500  9    means of avoiding self-examination, and so it has been
F42 1510  8    decided that the riots were "Communist" inspired. Nor
F42 1520  3    was it long, naturally, before prominent Negroes rushed
F42 1530  3    forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters
F42 1540  1    do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.
F42 1550  1       According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing
F42 1550 10    view, these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible,
F42 1560  7    Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.
F42 1570  1       I find this view amazing. It is a view which even
F42 1580  1    a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict.
F42 1580  9    One has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and
F42 1590 10    ask oneself two questions. The first question is: Would
F42 1600  6    I like to live here? And the second question is: Why
F42 1610  7    don't those who now live here move out? The answer
F42 1620  4    to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless one
F42 1630  2    takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that
F42 1630 10    Negroes are, somehow, different from white people,
F42 1640  7    I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that
F42 1650  5    the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel
F42 1660  5    injustice but a grave national liability.
F42 1660 11       Now, I do not doubt that, among the people at the
F42 1670 11    U.N. that day, there were Stalinist and professional
F42 1680  5    revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives.
F42 1690  4    Wherever there is great social discontent, these people
F42 1700  2    are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is
F42 1700 12    not as frightening as the discontent which creates
F42 1710  7    their opportunity. What I find appalling- and really
F42 1720  6    dangerous- is the American assumption that the Negro
F42 1730  4    is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical
F42 1740  1    agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.
F42 1740 11    It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult,
F42 1750  6    implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move
F42 1760  5    unless they are manipulated.
