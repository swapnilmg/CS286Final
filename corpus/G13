G13 0010  1    Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a
G13 0010 10    naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell
G13 0020  9    to Arms never maintained that sex was all. Hemingway's
G13 0030  7    fiction is supported by a "moral" backbone and in its
G13 0040  6    search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension.
G13 0050  4    And D. H. Lawrence, in Fantasia of the Unconscious,
G13 0060  2    protested vehemently against the overestimation of
G13 0070  1    the sexual motive. Though sex in some form or other
G13 0070 11    enters into all human activity and it was a good thing
G13 0080  8    that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature,
G13 0090  4    it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex.
G13 0100  2    "All is not sex", declared Lawrence. Man is not confined
G13 0110  1    to one outlet for his vital energy. The creative urge,
G13 0110 11    for example, transcends the body and the self.
G13 0120  7       But for the beat generation all is sex. Nothing
G13 0130  5    is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations
G13 0140  2    of this group than their attitude toward sex. For the
G13 0150  2    beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society
G13 0150 12    that is based on the repression of the sex instinct.
G13 0160  8    He has elevated sex- not Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous,
G13 0170  7    uninhibited sex- to the rank of the godhead; it is
G13 0180  6    Astarte, Ishtar, Venus, Yahwe, Dionysus, Christ, the
G13 0190  3    mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through
G13 0190 10    the body of the universe. Jazz is sex, marijuana is
G13 0200 10    a stimulus to sex, the beat tempo is adjusted to the
G13 0210  7    orgiastic release of the sexual impulse. Lawrence Lipton,
G13 0220  3    in The Holy Barbarians, stresses that for the beat
G13 0230  3    generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it
G13 0230 13    is a mystique, and their private language is rich in
G13 0240  9    the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so
G13 0250  5    that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse.
G13 0260  3    The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against
G13 0270  1    the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal
G13 0270 10    to dance in a public place. The dance is but a disguised
G13 0280 10    ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire.
G13 0290  5    For this reason, too, their language is more forthright
G13 0300  4    and earthy. The beatniks crave a sexual experience
G13 0310  1    in which their whole being participates.
G13 0310  7       It is therefore not surprising that they resist
G13 0320  5    the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity, for
G13 0330  2    like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual
G13 0330 12    energy. They withdraw to the underground of the slums
G13 0340  9    where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety.
G13 0350  6    Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation,
G13 0360  5    they disdain the art of "necking" and "petting". That
G13 0370  2    is reserved for the squares. If they avoid the use
G13 0380  1    of the pungent, outlawed four-letter word it is because
G13 0380 11    it is taboo; it is sacred. As Lipton, the prophet of
G13 0390  9    the beat generation, declares: "In the sexual act,
G13 0400  5    the beat are filled with mana, the divine power. This
G13 0410  3    is far from the vulgar, leering sexuality of the middle-class
G13 0420  1    square in heat". This is the Holy Grail these knights
G13 0420 11    of the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic
G13 0430  9    urge to which they respond.
G13 0440  2       If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out
G13 0450  1    of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan Thomas is the
G13 0450 11    poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification
G13 0460  7    for their indulgence in liquor, marijuana, sex, and
G13 0470  6    jazz. In addition, they have been converted to Zen
G13 0480  3    Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is "natural"
G13 0490  1    and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in
G13 0490  9    the world is flowing. Thus, paradoxically, the beat
G13 0500  7    writers resort to "religious" metaphors: they are in
G13 0510  5    search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous, but not
G13 0520  3    anything connected with formal religion. What they
G13 0520 10    are after is the beatific vision. And Zen Buddhism,
G13 0530  9    though it is extremely difficult to understand how
G13 0540  5    these internal contradictions are reconciled, helps
G13 0550  2    them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation
G13 0550 10    through sexual release.
G13 0560  3       The style of life chosen by the beat generation,
G13 0570  1    the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely
G13 0570 10    their own, is designed to enhance the value of the
G13 0580  9    sexual experience. Jazz is good not only because it
G13 0590  6    promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual
G13 0600  2    effect. Jazz is the musical language of sex, the vocabulary
G13 0600 12    of the orgasm; indeed, it is maintained that the sexual
G13 0610 10    element in jazz, by freeing the listener of his inhibitions,
G13 0620  8    can have therapeutic value. That is why, the argument
G13 0630  7    runs, the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely
G13 0640  5    fascinated by it. Instead of giving themselves spontaneously
G13 0650  2    to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they
G13 0660  1    undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn
G13 0660  9    to prostitutes for satisfaction. Thus jazz is transmuted
G13 0670  7    into something holy, the sacred road to integration
G13 0680  5    of being. Jazz, like sex, is a mystique. It is not
G13 0690  3    a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the
G13 0690 13    creative impulse in unfettered man.
G13 0700  5       The mystique of sex, combined with marijuana and
G13 0710  3    jazz, is intended to provide a design for living. Those
G13 0720  1    who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive
G13 0720  9    and free, their instincts put at the service of the
G13 0730  8    imagination. Righteous in their denunciation of all
G13 0740  4    that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all men
G13 0750  2    become cool cats; let them learn to "swing" freely,
G13 0750 11    to let go, to become authentically themselves, and
G13 0760  7    then perhaps civilization will be saved. The beatnik,
G13 0770  6    seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with
G13 0780  3    a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation
G13 0790  1    in the living present. If he is the child of nothingness,
G13 0790 12    if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic
G13 0800 10    wars, then he will consult only his own organic needs
G13 0810  6    and go beyond good and evil. He will not curb his instinctual
G13 0820  4    desires but release the energy within him that makes
G13 0830  2    him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only
G13 0830 13    for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation
G13 0840  7    explodes on earth.
G13 0850  1       That is why the members of the beat generation proudly
G13 0850 11    assume the title of the holy barbarians; they will
G13 0860  8    destroy the shrines, temples, museums, and churches
G13 0870  4    of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life
G13 0880  2    they believe in. Apart from the categorical imperative
G13 0880 10    they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the
G13 0890  8    only affirmation they are capable of making is that
G13 0900  6    art is their only refuge. Their writing, born of their
G13 0910  4    experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality,
G13 0910 10    reflects the extremity of their existential alienation.
G13 0920  7    The mind has betrayed them, reason is the foe of life;
G13 0930  8    they will trust only their physical sensations, the
G13 0940  3    wisdom of the body, the holy promptings of the unconscious.
G13 0950  1    With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate,
G13 0950  9    but their faith in love, inspired by the revolutionary
G13 0960  8    rhythms of jazz, culminates in the climax of the orgasm.
G13 0970  7    Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath,
G13 0980  4    rootless and irresponsible. Their rebellion against
G13 0990  1    authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence
G13 0990 10    of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.
G13 1000  6       And the life they lead is undisciplined and for
G13 1010  6    the most part unproductive, even though they make a
G13 1020  4    fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit-
G13 1030  1    writing, painting, music. They are non-conformists
G13 1030  8    on principle. When they express themselves it is incandescent
G13 1040  7    hatred that shines forth, the rage of repudiation,
G13 1050  5    the ecstasy of negation. It is sex that obsesses them,
G13 1060  2    sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.
G13 1060 12    What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the
G13 1070  8    degree to which sex can inspire the Muse. Monogamy
G13 1080  5    is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle
G13 1090  2    class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the
G13 1090 11    courage to break out of that prison of respectability.
G13 1100  9    One girl describes her past, her succession of broken
G13 1110  7    marriages, the abortions she has had and finally confesses
G13 1120  4    that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must
G13 1130  2    justify her passion. If it is an honest feeling, then
G13 1130 12    why should she not yield to it? "Most often", she says,
G13 1140 10    "it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest".
G13 1150  6    There is nothing holy in wedlock. This girl soon drops
G13 1160  8    the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life.
G13 1170  6    She finds married life stifling and every prolonged
G13 1180  2    sex relationship unbearably monotonous.
G13 1180  6       This confession serves to make clear in part what
G13 1190  8    is behind this sexual revolution: the craving for sensation
G13 1200  5    for its own sake, the need for change, for new experiences.
G13 1210  4    Boredom is death. In the realm of physical sensations,
G13 1220  1    sex reigns supreme. Hence the beatniks sustain themselves
G13 1220  9    on marijuana, jazz, free swinging poetry, exhausting
G13 1230  7    themselves in orgies of sex; some of them are driven
G13 1240  8    over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with
G13 1250  4    reality. One beat poet composes a poem, "Lines on a
G13 1260  2    Tijuana John", which contains a few happy hints for
G13 1260 11    survival. The new fact the initiates of this cult have
G13 1270 10    to learn is that they must move toward simplicity.
G13 1280  4    The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation
G13 1290  2    is to find a new way of life which they can express
G13 1290 14    in poetry and fiction, but what they produce is unfortunately
G13 1300  9    disordered, nourished solely on the hysteria of negation.
G13 1310  7       Who are the creative representatives of this movement?
G13 1320  5    Nymphomaniacs, junkies, homosexuals, drug addicts,
G13 1330  3    lesbians, alcoholics, the weak, the frustrated, the
G13 1340  2    irresolute, the despairing, the derelicts and outcasts
G13 1340  9    of society. They embrace independent poverty, usually
G13 1350  6    with a "shack-up" partner who will help support them.
G13 1360  6    They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony.
G13 1370  3    Their previous legalized marriages do not count, for
G13 1380  2    they hold the laws of the state null and void. They
G13 1380 13    feel they are leagued against a hostile, persecutory
G13 1390  7    world, faced with the concerted malevolent opposition
G13 1400  3    of squares and their hirelings, the police. This is
G13 1410  3    the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending
G13 1420  1    their way of life, their search for wholeness, though
G13 1420 10    their actual existence fails to reach these "religious"
G13 1430  6    heights. One beatnik got the woman he was living with
G13 1440  7    so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night
G13 1450  3    sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up.
G13 1450 13    What obsessions had she picked up during these long
G13 1460  9    nights of talk? Sex as the creative principle of the
G13 1470  7    universe, the secret of primitive religion, the life
G13 1480  3    of myth. Everything in the final analysis reduced itself
G13 1490  1    to sexual symbolism. In his chapter on "The Loveways
G13 1490 10    of the Beat Generation", Lipton spares the reader none
G13 1500  8    of the sordid details. No one asks questions about
G13 1510  6    the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long
G13 1520  4    as the partners share the negative attitudes of the
G13 1530  1    group.
G13 1530  2       The women who come to West Venice, having forsaken
G13 1530 11    radicalism, are interested in living only for the moment,
G13 1540  9    in being constantly on the move. Others who are attracted
G13 1550  8    to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals,
G13 1560  4    heroin addicts, and smalltime hoodlums. Those who are
G13 1570  4    sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.
G13 1580  1    Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana, they do
G13 1580  9    not have to be initiated. Part of the ritual of sex
G13 1590  8    is the use of marijuana. As Lipton puts it: "The Eros
G13 1600  5    is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater
G13 1610  4    force, as a unifying principle in human relationships,
G13 1620  1    than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual
G13 1620 11    metaphysical orgasms. The magic circle is, in fact,
G13 1630  8    a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm".
G13 1640  4    Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes
G13 1650  2    alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced
G13 1650  9    sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame
G13 1660 11    to the universe of being. Carried high on this "charge",
G13 1670  6    he composes "magical" poetry that captures the organic
G13 1680  5    rhythms of life in words. If he thus achieves a lyrical,
G13 1690  3    dreamlike, drugged intensity, he pays the price for
G13 1690 11    his indulgence by producing work- Allen Ginsberg's
G13 1700  7    "Howl" is a striking example of this tendency- that
G13 1710  8    is disoriented, Dionysian but without depth and without
G13 1720  6    Apollonian control. For drugs are in themselves no
G13 1730  3    royal road to creativity. How is the beat poet to achieve
G13 1740  1    unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in
G13 1740 13    a systematic derangement of senses.
G13 1750  4       If love reflects the nature of man, as Ortega y
G13 1760  3    Gasset believes, if the person in love betrays decisively
G13 1760 12    what he is by his behavior in love, then the writers
G13 1770 11    of the beat generation are creating a new literary
G13 1780  6    genre.
