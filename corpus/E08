E08 0010  1       Scientists say that the world and everything in
E08 0010  9    it are based on mathematics. Without math the men who
E08 0020  7    are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons
E08 0030  5    for the many things that make the world go 'round would
E08 0040  2    not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and
E08 0040 10    communicating the things they discover and learn. Math
E08 0050  8    and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different
E08 0060  8    problems are, therefore, essential to any scientific
E08 0070  4    endeavor.
E08 0070  5       Hot rodding is a science. It's not a science as
E08 0080  5    involved as determining what makes the earth rotate
E08 0090  1    on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite
E08 0090 12    into orbit but it is, nevertheless, a science. But
E08 0100  8    because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean
E08 0110  3    that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.
E08 0120  1    A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for
E08 0120 12    years without becoming even remotely involved with
E08 0130  7    mathematical problems; however, he will have a clearer
E08 0140  7    understanding of what he is doing and the chances are
E08 0150  4    he will be more successful if he understands the few
E08 0160  1    formulas that apply to rodding.
E08 0160  6       A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern
E08 0170  5    for solving a specific problem. It places the various
E08 0180  2    factors involved in the problem in their correct order
E08 0180 11    in relation to each other so that the influence of
E08 0190  9    factors on each other can be computed.
E08 0200  3       The first step in using a formula is to insert the
E08 0210  1    numerical values of the factors involved in their correct
E08 0210 10    positions in the formula. This changes the formula
E08 0220  8    to an "equation". The equation is used for the mathematical
E08 0230  7    process of solving the problem.
E08 0240  1       Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.
E08 0240  8    They involve only simple mathematics that are taught
E08 0250  7    in grammar school arithmetic classes. However, it is
E08 0260  5    essential that the various mathematical symbols used
E08 0270  2    in the equations be understood so that the mathematical
E08 0270 11    processes can be done properly and in their correct
E08 0280  9    order. They indicate simple division, multiplication,
E08 0290  4    subtraction, and addition.
E08 0300  1       The symbol for division is a straight line that
E08 0300  9    separates two numbers placed one above the other. The
E08 0310  7    lower number is always divided into the upper number:
E08 0320  3    **f
E08 0320  4       The symbol for multiplication is "@". It is used
E08 0340  4    to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example:
E08 0350  1    **f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied
E08 0350 10    in any order. The result will be the same regardless
E08 0360  9    of the order used.
E08 0370  1       The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus
E08 0370  9    sign. This is nothing more than a dash. It separates
E08 0380  8    two or more numbers. The number on the right of the
E08 0390  6    symbol is always subtracted from the number on the
E08 0400  2    left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than
E08 0400 12    two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the
E08 0410  7    subtraction must be carried out from the left to right
E08 0420  7    if the result is to be correct. For example, for the
E08 0430  3    problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals
E08 0440  1    9.
E08 0440  2       Addition is indicated by the + symbol. The symbol
E08 0440 11    is used to separate two or more numbers. For example:
E08 0450 10    **f Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed
E08 0460  7    in any order.
E08 0460 10       When solving an equation that involves division
E08 0470  6    as well as other steps, do all the division steps first
E08 0490  1    to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical
E08 0500  2    value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can
E08 0500  8    then be accomplished as they appear in the equation
E08 0510  9    by starting at the left end of the equation and working
E08 0520  7    toward the right. Completing the division first also
E08 0530  4    includes those division parts that require multiplication,
E08 0540  1    subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced
E08 0550  1    by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product
E08 0550 11    by 12. This part of the equation would then become
E08 0560  7    4.
E08 0560  8       For use in formulas, fractions should be converted
E08 0570  4    to their decimal equivalents. The easiest way to do
E08 0580  4    this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose
E08 0590  1    are available from many sources. They are included
E08 0590  9    in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are
E08 0600  5    stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments.
E08 0610  3       The various mathematical processes can be simplified
E08 0620  3    by carrying the results to only two or three decimal
E08 0620 13    places. Shortening the results in this manner will
E08 0630  8    not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of
E08 0640  6    the final result.
E08 0640  9       Some formulas contain "constants". A constant is
E08 0650  6    a number that remains the same regardless of the other
E08 0660  5    numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation.
E08 0670  2    It is a number without which the equation cannot be
E08 0670 12    solved correctly.
E08 0680  2       Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.
E08 0690  1    The answers they give can often pave the way to performance
E08 0690 12    increases and, quite often, are necessary for completing
E08 0700  7    entry blanks for different events. When it is needed,
E08 0710  6    one formula is as important as another. However, some
E08 0720  3    formulas are used more than others. We'll take them
E08 0730  2    in the general order of their popularity.
E08 0730  9    #ENGINE DISPLACEMENT#
E08 0740  1    A rodder should be able to compute the displacement
E08 0740 10    of his engine. Displacement is sometimes referred to
E08 0750  6    as "swept volume". Most entry blanks for competitive
E08 0760  5    events require engine displacement information because
E08 0770  2    of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute
E08 0780  1    displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring
E08 0780 10    and stroking can be computed.
E08 0790  4       Factors involved in the displacement formula are
E08 0800  2    the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length
E08 0800 11    of the piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the
E08 0810  9    engine, and a constant. The constant is .7854, which
E08 0820  6    is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant known as
E08 0830  3    "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions
E08 0840  1    of circles.
E08 0840  3       Actually, the engine displacement formula is the
E08 0850  2    standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder
E08 0850 11    of any type with an added factor that represents the
E08 0860  8    number of cylinders in the engine. The cross-sectional
E08 0870  5    area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume
E08 0880  4    of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying
E08 0890  1    the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent
E08 0890 11    of the length of the cylinders. Multiplying the result
E08 0900  7    by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the
E08 0910  6    engine's total displacement.
E08 0910  9       The formula is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions
E08 0920  8    of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches.
E08 0930  6    Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters
E08 0940  3    will give the displacement in cubic centimeters (cc).
E08 0950  2    One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals
E08 0950 11    16.38 cubic centimeters.
E08 0960  3       For example, let's consider a standard 283 cubic
E08 0970  3    inch Chevy V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter
E08 0980  1    of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The
E08 0980 13    formula, with the fractions converted to decimals,
E08 0990  6    becomes **f.
E08 0990  8       To arrive at the answer, multiply the numbers together
E08 1000  8    by starting at the left of the group and working to
E08 1010  6    the right. The different steps will look like this:
E08 1020  2    **f
E08 1020  3    #COMPRESSION RATIO#
E08 1020  5    A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing
E08 1030  5    the cylinder's volume, or its displacement, with the
E08 1040  3    total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.
E08 1050  1    Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but
E08 1050  8    combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid.
E08 1060  8       Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same
E08 1070  6    manner as for the displacement formula: **f.
E08 1080  2       To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers
E08 1090  1    in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark
E08 1090 10    plug in the chamber and support the head so that its
E08 1100  8    gasket surface is level. Then pour water or light oil
E08 1110  5    from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the
E08 1120  2    chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the
E08 1120 11    chamber. This is possible with water and other liquids
E08 1130  8    that have a high surface tension. Such liquids will
E08 1140  4    rise to a considerable height above the surface around
E08 1150  2    the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.
E08 1160  1       The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is
E08 1160 10    determined by subtracting the quantity still in the
E08 1170  6    beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity.
E08 1180  4    Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters (cc),
E08 1190  2    making it necessary to convert the result to cubic
E08 1190 11    inches. However, the displacement of the cylinder can
E08 1200  8    be converted to cubic centimeters. The compression
E08 1210  4    ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same
E08 1220  4    regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters
E08 1220 12    are used. The only precaution is that all volumes used
E08 1230 10    in the formula be quoted in the same terms.
E08 1240  6       The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket
E08 1250  5    must be computed by multiplying its area in square
E08 1260  1    inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of
E08 1260  9    an inch. Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate
E08 1270  7    the square inch area of the opening but the calculation
E08 1280  4    can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it
E08 1290  3    won't affect the final computation. The volume of the
E08 1290 12    opening is added to the combustion chamber volume.
E08 1300  8       Another thing that must be taken into consideration
E08 1310  7    is the volume of the area between the top of the piston
E08 1320  6    and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is
E08 1330  2    in top dead center position. Compute this volume by
E08 1330 11    measuring the distance from the top of the block to
E08 1340 10    the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth
E08 1350  6    micrometer or some other precision measuring device
E08 1360  2    and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.
E08 1360 13    The formula for this step is: **f This volume is added
E08 1370 11    to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head
E08 1380  7    gasket opening. The total of these three volumes is
E08 1390  5    the "final combustion chamber volume".
E08 1400  1       After the factors just described have been computed,
E08 1400  9    they are applied to the following formula: **f
E08 1410  6       For an example let's dream up an engine that has
E08 1420  6    a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches
E08 1430  2    and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying
E08 1430 11    these figures to the formula we get the equation: **f
E08 1440  9    The compression ratio is 10 to 1.
E08 1450  4       This method of computing compression ratio cannot
E08 1450 11    be used accurately for engines that have pistons with
E08 1460  9    either domed or irregularly shaped heads. Any irregularity
E08 1470  5    on the piston heads will make it impossible, with normal
E08 1480  5    means, to determine the final combustion chamber volume
E08 1490  3    because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot
E08 1500  1    be readily computed. The only way to determine the
E08 1500 10    final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are
E08 1510  7    used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder
E08 1520  4    head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston
E08 1530  1    is in top dead center position.
E08 1530  7    #GEAR RATIO- SPEED RELATIONSHIPS#
E08 1540  1    There are four versions of the formula that involves
E08 1540 10    the relationships of car speed, engine speed, rear
E08 1550  7    axle gear ratio, and rear tire size. By using the appropriate
E08 1560  6    version any one of these factors can be determined
E08 1570  3    for any combination of the other three.
E08 1570 10       To simplify the formulas a representative symbol
E08 1580  6    is substituted for each of the factors. These are
E08 1590  5       MPH for Car speed
E08 1590  9       RPM for Engine crankshaft speed
E08 1600  5       R for Rear axle gear ratio
E08 1610  1       W for Tire size
E08 1610  5       Tire size can be determined in several ways but
E08 1620  4    the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any
E08 1620 15    is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and
E08 1630 10    tire assembly. This is done by measuring the distance
E08 1640  7    from the surface on which the tire is resting to the
E08 1650  5    center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated
E08 1660  1    to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must
E08 1660 11    be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement
E08 1670  7    is made. The measurement must be in inches. Any fraction
E08 1680  7    of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted
E08 1690  4    to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.
E08 1700  1    When tire size is measured in this manner a constant
E08 1700 11    of 168 is used in the formula.
E08 1710  4       To determine car speed for a given combination of
E08 1720  2    engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula
E08 1720 11    is: **f For an engine speed of 5000 rpm, a gear ratio
E08 1730 11    of 4.00 to 1, and a tire radius of 13 inches, the equation
E08 1740  8    would look like this: **f
E08 1750  1       To determine engine speed for a given combination
E08 1750  9    of the other three factors the formula is: **f Using
E08 1760  7    the same figures as for the previous example, the equation
E08 1770  5    becomes: **f
E08 1770  7       To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination
E08 1780  8    of the other three factors, the formula is: **f Using
E08 1790  5    the figures from the previous examples, the equation
E08 1800  2    becomes: **f
