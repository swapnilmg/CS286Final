E12 0010  1       THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length
E12 0010 10    of this land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook
E12 0020  9    description alone, the overwhelming space and variety
E12 0030  5    of this country held together under one government.
E12 0040  2    The miracle of democratic America comes home to one
E12 0040 11    most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great
E12 0050 10    Plains of the Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the
E12 0060  8    Northwest mountains; the smoke-filled, art-filled,
E12 0070  5    drama-filled life of the great cities of the East;
E12 0080  2    the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add
E12 0080 13    to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation,
E12 0090  8    we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska.
E12 0100  7       To hope to cover just one region of this land and
E12 0110  6    to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of course,
E12 0120  2    to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires
E12 0120 10    advance planning. For this reason, U.S. Camera has
E12 0130  7    prepared this special U.S.A. vacation feature. We divided
E12 0140  6    the country into five regions plus Hawaii and Alaska
E12 0150  6    and in each is included a general description of the
E12 0160  4    area plus specific recommendations of places and events
E12 0170  1    to cover. Any special photographic requirements are
E12 0170  8    also given.
E12 0180  1       Use this section to plan now to make the most of
E12 0180 12    your vacation in photogenic America.
E12 0190  4    #THE NORTHEAST#
E12 0190  6    BIRTHPLACE of the nation, the Northeast offers historic
E12 0200  6    battlefields; lovely old villages and a rugged seashore
E12 0210  5    among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling farms
E12 0220  2    of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City,
E12 0230  1    the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included
E12 0230 10    in your Northeast vacation.
E12 0240  2       By automobile from New York, for example, you can
E12 0250  1    take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to
E12 0250 12    see the colonial homes and the U.S. Naval Academy (where
E12 0260  8    you can shoot the dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington,
E12 0270  7    D.C., for an eye-filling tour of the city; or to Lancaster,
E12 0280  8    Pa., the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch country;
E12 0290  5    Philadelphia with its historic buildings and nearby
E12 0300  3    Valley Forge; to West Point, N.Y., the famous military
E12 0310  3    academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.
E12 0320  1       New England deserves as much of your vacation time
E12 0320 10    as you can afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing
E12 0330  9    wonderful beaches, artists' colonies and quaint townships.
E12 0340  5    From here you can easily include a side trip to the
E12 0350  6    old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts, which
E12 0360  2    looks just as it must have two centuries ago.
E12 0360 11       At Sturbridge Village, Massachusetts, you'll find
E12 0370  5    a completely-restored New England town. North to Acadia
E12 0380  6    National Park, Maine, with views of a rockbound coast
E12 0390  5    and dark, magnificent forests.
E12 0390  9       One of the most exciting ways to end a Northeast
E12 0400  8    vacation would be with a week in New York City. Return
E12 0410  6    through New England, stopping for a visit to Lake Champlain
E12 0420  4    where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan Allen
E12 0430  2    Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the
E12 0430 11    Adirondack Mts. and the Winooski River.
E12 0440  6       Now you're ready for a whirlwind sightseeing tour
E12 0450  5    of America's most exciting city. The skyline, the bridges,
E12 0460  4    Broadway, and the Staten Island ferry are only a few
E12 0470  4    of the spots to put on your "must" list for New York
E12 0480  1    City.
E12 0480  2    #PHOTOGRAPHING IN THE NORTHEAST#
E12 0480  6    Some tips for shooting in Northeastern locales: In
E12 0490  4    New York City don't miss coverage of the United Nations.
E12 0500  5    These striking, modernistic buildings on the East River
E12 0510  3    are open to the public and every weekday guided tours
E12 0510 13    are available. Pictures can be taken in the public
E12 0520  9    areas and when on tours. However, the use of tripods
E12 0530  6    is not allowed. Photos of Conference Rooms and the
E12 0540  4    General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms
E12 0550  1    are not being used for meetings. Flash is allowed,
E12 0550 10    subject to above restrictions.
E12 0560  2       Around New England, you'll no doubt want a color
E12 0570  2    shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses. Be careful
E12 0570 11    here not to overexpose this subject since they are
E12 0580  8    extremely bright and light-reflecting. In color, 1/50th
E12 0600  4    of a second between **f and **f will do for bright,
E12 0610  2    frontal sunlight.
E12 0610  4    #THE SOUTH#
E12 0610  6    THE SOUTHERN United States, extending from Florida
E12 0620  5    in the east to Texas in the west, still maintains its
E12 0630  4    unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.
E12 0640  1    It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural
E12 0640 10    beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation,
E12 0650  7    on the one hand, to places where entertainment and
E12 0660  4    spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the
E12 0670  3    tourist with camera.
E12 0670  6       Of special interest this anniversary year of the
E12 0680  4    war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields
E12 0690  1    where, likely as not, you'll catch some memorial re-enactments.
E12 0700  1    Among the locales to visit are Shiloh, Tennessee; Lookout
E12 0700 10    Mountain, Tennessee; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Richmond,
E12 0710  5    Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia, and Fredericksburg,
E12 0720  5    Virginia.
E12 0720  6       Florida provides tropical scenes unequalled in the
E12 0730  7    United States. At Cypress Gardens special bleachers
E12 0740  5    are set up for photographers at water-ski shows and
E12 0750  3    lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings.
E12 0760  1    Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and
E12 0760  9    in Everglades National Park there are opportunities
E12 0770  5    to photograph rare wildlife. Miami Beach and surroundings
E12 0780  4    feature fabulous "hotel row", palm-studded beaches
E12 0790  2    plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle.
E12 0800  1       One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour
E12 0800 11    is the city of New Orleans. The famous old French and
E12 0810  7    Spanish buildings with their elaborate wrought iron
E12 0820  4    balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter
E12 0830  2    present an Old World scene.
E12 0830  7       For restoration of early American life the places
E12 0840  5    to visit are Williamsburg, Jamestown and Yorktown,
E12 0850  2    Virginia. Another Virginia sight and a photographic
E12 0850  9    adventure are the Luray Caverns, lit by photofloodlights.
E12 0860  8       The great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions
E12 0870  8    such as the Dallas Fair Park with its art and natural
E12 0880  8    history museums. In contrast are the vast open stretches
E12 0890  6    of ranch country and oil wells. In San Antonio visit
E12 0900  3    the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish
E12 0910  1    buildings and churches.
E12 0910  4       The Great Smoky Mountains is another area of the
E12 0920  4    South well worth a visit. Along the 127-mile route
E12 0920 14    through Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can
E12 0930  8    photograph the breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys
E12 0940  7    which come into view at every turn. Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
E12 0950  4    is the center of this area. Another scenic spot in
E12 0960  3    Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens
E12 0970  1    are not to be missed.
E12 0970  6       Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks of the
E12 0980  3    South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston,
E12 0990  1    S.C., Natchez, Miss., and Savannah, Ga. At Charlottesville,
E12 1000  1    Va., shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of
E12 1000  9    the University.
E12 1010  2    #PICTURING THE SOUTH#
E12 1010  5    Foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many of
E12 1020  5    the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific
E12 1030  2    tips on how and where to shoot it are in order. For
E12 1030 14    example, the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
E12 1040  8    sponsors special camera tours into the Great Smoky
E12 1050  7    Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild
E12 1060  4    flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.
E12 1070  1       Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas
E12 1070  9    where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight
E12 1080  6    filtering through the overhead branches. Best solution
E12 1090  3    is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or
E12 1100  2    shade. In any instance, you should determine the exposure
E12 1100 11    according to the type of light which falls on most
E12 1110 10    of the subject area.
E12 1120  1       Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide
E12 1120  9    a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics
E12 1130  7    you'll be making.
E12 1130 10       For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum
E12 1140  9    Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes
E12 1150  5    a tripod. Enough daylight is usually available from
E12 1160  3    the windows, but if you have synchronized flash- use
E12 1170  1    it.
E12 1170  2       For some unusual photographic subjects, if your
E12 1170  9    vacation takes you nearby, try these events: the 600-mile
E12 1180  9    auto race in Charlotte, N. C., on May 27; the Florida
E12 1190  8    Folk Festival, White Springs, May 5-7; Singing on the
E12 1200  7    Mountain in Linville, North Carolina, on June 25. Peak
E12 1210  5    action photography is your goal at Miami's Seaquarium
E12 1220  2    and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events.
E12 1220  8    #THE MIDWEST#
E12 1230  2    A PLEASANT start to your midwestern vacation is a few
E12 1240  1    days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago. Lake Michigan offers
E12 1240  9    swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with
E12 1250  7    beaches. A visit to Chicago's museums and a stroll
E12 1260  5    around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold many photogenic
E12 1270  3    subjects to the alert photographer.
E12 1270  8       Wisconsin Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks
E12 1280  6    carved by the Wisconsin River are overgrown with fern
E12 1290  5    and other foliage, rates a stopover when traveling
E12 1300  2    from Chicago.
E12 1300  4       The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch
E12 1310  2    out across the Midwest from Chicago. In North Dakota
E12 1320  1    the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you
E12 1320  8    to translate its wonder on to film. While here, visit
E12 1330  8    Theodore Roosevelt National Park for its spectacular
E12 1340  5    scenery.
E12 1340  6       Another spot with an image-provoking name is the
E12 1350  4    Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier mining
E12 1360  2    town of Deadwood. The Black Hills Passion Play is produced
E12 1370  1    every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting.
E12 1380  1       Of course, while in this vicinity you won't want
E12 1380  9    to miss a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial
E12 1390  5    where on the side of a mountain are the famous sculptures
E12 1400  5    of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Theodore
E12 1410  3    Roosevelt.
E12 1410  4       In Missouri (which we are including in our general
E12 1420  4    Midwest region) you can glance into Mark Twain's birthplace
E12 1430  2    at Hannibal, see the landmarks of his life and writings
E12 1440  1    and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief.
E12 1450  1       Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to
E12 1450  9    be seen- his tomb and other landmarks.
E12 1460  5       Minnesota, fabled land of waters, is in itself,
E12 1470  3    ideal vacationland, having within its borders 10,000
E12 1480  6    lakes! Itasca State Park, where the Mississippi River
E12 1490  8    begins, is one of the outstanding tourist spots in
E12 1500  7    Minnesota.
E12 1500  8       Mementoes of the Old West recall the days of Wyatt
E12 1510  8    Earp in Dodge City, Nebraska, where present-day cowboys
E12 1520  5    add a colorful human interest note to your vacation
E12 1530  2    shooting.
E12 1530  3       Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas, the birthplace
E12 1540  3    of ex-President Eisenhower. There's a museum here and
E12 1550  2    also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle
E12 1550 11    boomtown of the 70's and 80's.
E12 1560  6       For a resort area, Mackinack Island, Michigan, is
E12 1570  3    the place to visit. It truly relives another age for
E12 1580  1    the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and
E12 1580  9    old British and French forts are left intact for tourists
E12 1590  8    to visit and record.
E12 1590 12    #PICTURES OF THE MIDWEST#
E12 1600  4    Night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation
E12 1610  3    travelogue and what better place to take them then
E12 1610 12    along Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? Just after sunset
E12 1620  8    is a good time to record the city lights in color since
E12 1630  9    you get a "fill-in" light from the sky.
E12 1640  4       Another memo for sightseers: bring your camera along
E12 1650  2    to museums. Photos of historic dioramas of the area
E12 1650 11    you visit will add depth and background to your vacation
E12 1660  9    photo story. Again, be sure your tripod is handy for
E12 1670  8    those sometimes-necessary time exposures.
E12 1680  1       Special events and their dates which will make interesting
E12 1690  1    shooting in the Midwest area, include the following:
E12 1690  9       A re-enactment of the Battle of Lexington, May 18th
E12 1700  8    at Lexington, Missouri; the world-renowned 500-mile
E12 1710  6    auto race at Indianapolis, Indiana, plus a festival
E12 1720  4    from May 27-30; "Song of Hiawatha", in Elgin, Illinois,
E12 1730  3    from June 20 to 24th. Michigan offers the lovely Tulip
E12 1740  2    Festival in Holland, Michigan, May 12-14; the USGA
E12 1750  1    Open in Birmingham from June 15-17; and the International
E12 1750 11    Freedom Festival in Detroit, June 29-July 4.
E12 1760  8       For early vacationers there's the fun-filled Fishing
E12 1770  6    Derby in Hot Springs, Arkansas, April 19-23, and the
E12 1780  6    Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs, April 20-22.
E12 1790  4    #THE WEST#
E12 1790  6    A WESTERN VACATION is practically synonymous with a
E12 1800  4    visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks
E12 1810  1    in this area. A tour of several of them is possible
E12 1810 12    in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of
E12 1820  9    these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward.
E12 1830  5       In California is located one of the most popular
E12 1840  2    of the national parks- Yosemite. Among its most spectacular
E12 1850  1    features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite
E12 1850 10    which drops 2,425 feet. The Sequoia Grove presents
E12 1860  7    another unique aspect of Yosemite, for these ancient
E12 1870  5    giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.
E12 1880  1       In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce
E12 1880 11    Canyon National Park. Fantastic colors are to be seen
E12 1890  9    in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom
E12 1900  7    out of the semiarid country in both parks.
E12 1910  3       Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous
E12 1920  1    landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint
E12 1920 10    of your Western vacation.
