P27 0010  1       Cady didn't come unglued easily, but this had not
P27 0010 10    been a day of glad tidings. Tax worries, production
P27 0020  7    worries, personnel worries, and the letter from Hanford
P27 0030  6    College, his own alma mater, a real snapper.
P27 0040  1       Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years
P27 0040 10    ago. Yes, the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic
P27 0050  9    transcript, character references, picture, health record,
P27 0060  6    successful college boards. But due to the many applicants
P27 0070  7    on file, would he co-operate and write a personal letter
P27 0080  4    giving them his son's motivation, interests and his
P27 0090  2    qualifications for leadership?
P27 0090  5       Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort. This
P27 0100  6    was it. This was the letter which would or would not
P27 0110  4    enroll his son, David, in Hanford. His son who had
P27 0110 14    never held an office in any organization in the eighteen
P27 0120 10    years of his life. His son who did not know whether
P27 0130  8    he wanted to be doctor, lawyer, merchant or chief.
P27 0140  3       He wondered if he had played it wrong. Maybe he
P27 0150  2    should have kept in touch. Gone back for reunions.
P27 0150 11    But he had been busy building a business, being a big
P27 0160  8    man in his own town just as he had been a big man at
P27 0170  8    Hanford, Class of 1935. Besides, Cady Partlow knew
P27 0180  2    he wasn't the old-grad-type.
P27 0180  8       It wouldn't help anyway. Look at Pete Alcorn, who
P27 0190  6    hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years.
P27 0200  4    Pete's son was rejected. Hanford College, Little Ivy
P27 0220  2    League, had no room for football players with low grades.
P27 0230  1       Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with
P27 0230 10    pride. Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A's
P27 0240  9    in math and science. Imagine his son being that good
P27 0250  7    in science! Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat
P27 0260  6    on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what
P27 0270  2    a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford.
P27 0270 12    But then, he hadn't studied very hard. Getting elected
P27 0280  8    president of the student body took a lot of time and
P27 0290  8    politicking.
P27 0290  9    ##
P27 0290 10    He put down his pipe and started to type. "In response
P27 0310  3    to your letter, I can in good conscience recommend
P27 0320  3    my son, David, in the field of leadership".
P27 0330  1       He stopped and looked at the picture of his son,
P27 0330 11    the picture on his desk which had changed with the
P27 0340  8    years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford
P27 0350  3    College. He didn't have to be told his son looked like
P27 0360  2    him. David had the same gray eyes, high cheekbones,
P27 0360 11    dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness. Height, 6'.
P27 0370  8    Weight, 160. Health, excellent.
P27 0380  2       He turned back to the typewriter with a little more
P27 0390  1    confidence. "His interests range from astronomy and
P27 0390  8    geology to electronics, tennis and swimming. His chief
P27 0400  6    motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to"-
P27 0410  6       Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard, ruining
P27 0420  5    the letter. He paced to the window and looked at the
P27 0430  3    city he had helped to build.
P27 0430  9       How do you tell a college president that your son
P27 0440  5    doesn't know what he wants to do? That you have refused
P27 0450  4    to drive him into the family business or push him into
P27 0460  2    a profession so you can say at the club, "Of course
P27 0460 13    David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be
P27 0470 10    an engineer"- or a lawyer, or an editor?
P27 0480  4       How do you tell a college like Hanford that your
P27 0490  2    son has a vast potential, that he will find himself?
P27 0490 12    Just give him time, give him a chance.
P27 0500  7       Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed
P27 0510  4    himself down before the typewriter, rolled in a fresh
P27 0520  1    sheet, and gave his letter the same savage attention
P27 0520 10    he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket
P27 0530 10    taken off his thick head.
P27 0540  1       What a production to make of a letter commending
P27 0540 10    your own son! His eyebrow went up in amusement at his
P27 0550  9    soul-searching panic. He told Hanford his son wanted
P27 0560  6    to go into the field of electronics. He told Hanford
P27 0570  3    his son had participated in numerous high-school activities.
P27 0580  1    He belonged to a social club, a civic group, little
P27 0580 11    theater, swimming team, and had been president of the
P27 0590  8    student forum as well as treasurer of the science club.
P27 0600  5       He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford
P27 0610  4    College and signed the letter. There, that did it.
P27 0620  1    Then he met the grave eyes of his wife, Anne, from
P27 0620 12    the photograph next to David's. He shoved the unsealed
P27 0630  8    letter into his coat pocket.
P27 0640  1       Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted
P27 0640 12    anything. After all, his wife had written most of his
P27 0650 10    letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow
P27 0660  6    Products. Anne had a way with words. Half of it was
P27 0670  4    natural, half was Smith College.
P27 0670  9       Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never
P27 0680  8    learned in any college. A woman had it or she didn't.
P27 0690  6    Anne had it. She said what she meant and let it be.
P27 0700  3    She never got on his back. He could take the advice
P27 0700 14    or leave it.
P27 0710  2       He whistled as he locked the office and grinned
P27 0710 11    as he got on the elevator.
P27 0720  5       "You look like you just heard a real gasser, Mr.
P27 0730  2    Partlow".
P27 0730  3       Cady looked at Tom, who had taken him up and down
P27 0740  4    for fifteen years. "I was just thinking how things
P27 0740 13    have changed. When I went to college they begged you
P27 0750 10    to come. Be our guest! It's our pleasure! Now you have
P27 0760  8    to be well rounded, firm in motivation and pre-packed
P27 0770  6    with knowledge"!
P27 0770  8       Tom slid open the door to the lobby. "That's a fact,
P27 0780  9    Mr. Partlow. My John applied to six colleges before
P27 0790  6    he got in".
P27 0790  9       "Going to State"?
P27 0800  2       "No. He's president of the rocket club here, you
P27 0810  2    know. Always messing around with science stuff. Real
P27 0810 10    bright along those lines, you might say. He got a science
P27 0820 10    scholarship to Yale".
P27 0821  1       "Oh", said Mr. Partlow, "that's fine, Tom. Just
P27 0840  1    fine".
P27 0840  2       As he drove home through the thinning traffic, Cady
P27 0850  1    felt the unease growing. He hadn't told anyone, but
P27 0850 10    he, too, had applied to five colleges for David. They
P27 0860  7    had all turned down his son. Weakness in leadership.
P27 0870  4    So sorry. Limited interests. So sorry. No clear motivation.
P27 0880  3    So sorry.
P27 0880  5       He suddenly realized when he walked into his own
P27 0890  4    pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini
P27 0900  1    Anne had waiting for him. But tonight his drink tasted
P27 0900 11    like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak
P27 0910  9    and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing
P27 0920  5    weight of the letter in his pocket.
P27 0930  1       Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually
P27 0930 11    did. He liked looking at Anne. Most people did. He
P27 0940  8    liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across
P27 0950  5    her nose. From those navy-blue eyes she saw things
P27 0960  3    as clearly and honestly as David did. She always could
P27 0960 13    sense the shag end of a woolly day.
P27 0970  1       "Board meeting tonight, Cady"?
P27 0980  1       "No, I begged off. Work to do".
P27 0980  8       "Can I have the car, dad"?
P27 0990  6       "Why not let him take it, Cady? I know it is midweek,
P27 1000  6    but it's only eight days before commencement. Let's
P27 1010  2    forget the rules".
P27 1010  5       Cady, deep in thought, neither heard nor answered.
P27 1020  4    ##
P27 1020  5    David grinned. Carefully he put down his steak knife
P27 1030  3    and said loudly, "Mr. Chairman"!
P27 1030  8       Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial
P27 1040 10    fire horse. "I'm sorry, Dave. The car? Of course you
P27 1050  8    can have it".
P27 1060  1       Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything
P27 1060 10    else, slowly, methodically and with interest. "Hear
P27 1070  5    anything from Hanford yet, dad"?
P27 1080  1       Cady begged the question. "Don't worry about it,
P27 1080  9    Dave. Your acceptance will come through".
P27 1090  6       Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the
P27 1100  7    car keys. "Don't be too sure, dad. Charles Burke got
P27 1110  4    turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student".
P27 1120  2       Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was
P27 1130  2    antisocial, a lone wolf, and completely one-sided.
P27 1130 10    "I can hardly say the same about you, Dave"!
P27 1140  7       Dave kissed her lightly. "Girls, my dear parent,
P27 1150  5    are here to stay! Get my old man to bed early. He looks
P27 1160  5    a little bit frayed".
P27 1160  9       Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked
P27 1170  7    up the coffeepot. "Let's go into the library. You do
P27 1180  5    seem somewhat tattered".
P27 1180  8       Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled
P27 1190  8    into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined
P27 1200  3    room. "I didn't know I looked so dilapidated"!
P27 1210  1       "Wrong word, darling. Your fur has been rubbed the
P27 1220  1    wrong way and you show it. Need any help"?
P27 1220 10       "In a way, yes. Hanford College hasn't decided on
P27 1230  6    Dave's application yet. They want a letter from me
P27 1240  6    on his motives, interests and leadership. Here's what
P27 1250  2    I wrote".
P27 1250  4       Cady handed her the letter, drank his coffee and
P27 1260  3    waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence.
P27 1270  1    Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes.
P27 1270  8       "I know you wrote this in a hurry, but, Cady, Dave
P27 1290  4    was only acting president of the student forum for
P27 1300  6    a few days. That was when half the school was down
P27 1310  3    with flu".
P27 1310  5       "But he was president".
P27 1320  1       "And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science
P27 1320 10    club. He just took over the week Bill Daley was in
P27 1330 11    the state basketball play-off".
P27 1340  1       Cady stuck his jaw out. "The fact remains he was
P27 1350  1    treasurer".
P27 1350  2       "And the swimming team. No, Cady, he made second
P27 1360  3    team. Just missed the first".
P27 1370  2       "A team is a team", insisted Cady. "Anything else"?
P27 1380  2       "Yes", she said quietly. "I don't think you've been
P27 1390  3    quite honest, Cady. It isn't like you. David's interests.
P27 1400  1    Astronomy. He was mad about stars at the age of nine.
P27 1400 12    Geology, You and Dave used his rock collection for
P27 1410  9    the bottom of the fishpond six years ago! Those aren't
P27 1420  6    his interests now".
P27 1430  1       "What do you suggest"?
P27 1430  4       "Just say he likes swimming, tennis, chess and music".
P27 1440  4       "Music! He hasn't been to a symphony concert all
P27 1450  3    season".
P27 1450  4       Anne smiled. "But he plays bass with Chief Crazy
P27 1460  4    Horse and his Five Colts"!
P27 1460  9       "You mean that rock-and-roll combo? Even in that
P27 1470 10    he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax.
P27 1480  7    He's- he's just there, that's all".
P27 1490  2       "Yes, he's just there. He keeps the beat going.
P27 1490 11    He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo.
P27 1500 11    He doesn't like to rise and shine. Don't worry, Cady,
P27 1510  9    he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year".
P27 1520  6       Cady appeared slightly mollified. "All right. But
P27 1530  4    I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy
P27 1540  3    Horse and his Five Colts".
P27 1540  8       Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its
P27 1550  7    grip on the back of his neck. "Maybe I am padding it
P27 1560  5    a bit, Anne", he said. "But you know how hard it is
P27 1570  3    to get a boy into a good college. He has to have leadership
P27 1580  1    as well as grades".
P27 1580  5       Anne folded the worrisome document. "Did you know
P27 1590  3    he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale
P27 1590 12    this weekend? He hasn't used it now for several years.
P27 1600 10    Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics"?
P27 1610  8       Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off
P27 1620  9    the curb on his heel. "And what would you say he wants
P27 1630  6    to do? Just what"?
P27 1630 10       "It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College. Why
P27 1640  9    don't you ask him"?
P27 1650  1       For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at
P27 1650 10    him so he could yell back. "I have talked to him, but
P27 1660 11    you know I've never tried to push him into any profession.
P27 1670  8    I won't be guilty of trying to run his life".
P27 1680  5       Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the
P27 1690  3    hospital guild. "Just because your father tried to
P27 1690 11    make a banker out of you, you've leaned over backward
P27 1700 10    to keep your hands off. But subconsciously you've wanted
P27 1710  6    him to conform to your mold. You want him to be a leader
P27 1720  8    of men, like you".
P27 1720 12       Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder.
P27 1730  8    "Dave has qualities of leadership. He just hasn't developed
P27 1740  5    them yet. Give him time".
P27 1750  1       He never will, Cady. Not the kind of leadership
P27 1750 10    you mean, working with lots of people. All your wishful
P27 1760  8    thinking won't change that. Remember what you used
P27 1780  5    to say in the Army? You can't run a war with ninety-nine
P27 1790  4    generals and one private"!
P27 1790  8       Cady walked the block to the mailbox, almost ashamed
P27 1800  8    of himself for arguing with Anne.
