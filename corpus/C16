C16 0010  1       A YEAR ago it was bruited that the primary character
C16 0020  1    in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the
C16 0030  9    Marquis Alfonso de Portago, the Spanish nobleman who
C16 0040  7    died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of
C16 0050  4    1957. If this was in fact Mr. Remarque's intention
C16 0060  2    he has achieved a notable failure. Clerfayt of "Heaven
C16 0070  1    Has No Favorites" resembles Portago only in that he
C16 0070 10    is male and a race-driver- quite a bad race-driver,
C16 0080  9    whereas Portago was a good one. He is a dull, unformed,
C16 0090  7    and aimless person; the twelfth Marquis de Portago
C16 0100  3    was intelligent, purposeful, and passionate.
C16 0110  1       One looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book
C16 0110  8    if only because not even a reasonably good novel has
C16 0120  8    yet been written grounded on automobile racing, as
C16 0130  3    dramatic a sport as mankind has devised. Unhappily,
C16 0140  1    "Heaven Has No Favorites" does not alter the record
C16 0140 10    except to add one more bad book to the list.
C16 0150  9       Mr. Remarque's conception of this novel was sound
C16 0160  6    and perhaps even noble. He proposed throwing together
C16 0170  2    a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced
C16 0180  1    on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and
C16 0180 10    recovery. His treatment of it is something else. His
C16 0190  8    heroine chooses to die- the price of recovery, years
C16 0200  5    under the strict regimen of a sanatorium, being higher
C16 0210  2    than she wishes to pay. Her lover precedes her in death,
C16 0210 13    at the wheel, and presumably he too has chosen. Between
C16 0220 10    the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this
C16 0230  7    dismal denouement, Mr. Remarque has laid down many
C16 0240  5    pages of junior-philosophical discourse, some demure
C16 0250  1    and rather fetching love-making, pleasant talk about
C16 0250  9    some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe,
C16 0260  6    and a modicum of automobile racing. The ramblings on
C16 0270  4    life, death, and the wonder of it all are distressing;
C16 0280  1    the love-making, perhaps because it is pale and low-key
C16 0280 12    when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors
C16 0290  9    and explicitness, is often charming; the automobile
C16 0300  5    racing bears little relation to reality.
C16 0310  1       This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage
C16 0310 10    and it is distinctly more important than it would have
C16 0320 10    been had the author drawn Clerfayt as, say, a tournament
C16 0330  7    golfer. Hazards to life and limb on the golf course,
C16 0340  6    while existent, are actuarially insignificant. Race-drivers,
C16 0350  3    on the other hand, are quite often killed on the circuit,
C16 0360  1    and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention
C16 0360  9    to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm,
C16 0370  7    one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate
C16 0380  5    precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores
C16 0390  4    and attitudes. He does not. The jacket biography describes
C16 0400  1    him as a former racing driver, and he may indeed have
C16 0400 12    been, although I do not recall having encountered his
C16 0410  8    name either in the records or the literature. Perhaps
C16 0420  5    he has only forgotten a great deal. The book carries
C16 0430  3    a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary
C16 0440  1    for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures
C16 0440 12    and formalities of racing. The necessity is not clear
C16 0450  8    to me, and, in any case, to present a case-hardened
C16 0460  6    race-driver as saying he has left his car, which, or
C16 0470  3    whom, he calls "Giuseppe", parked "on the Place Vendome
C16 0480  1    sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked
C16 0480 10    around him" is not a liberty; it is an absurdity.
C16 0490 10       But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death,
C16 0500  6    which is the primary concern of the book, that Remarque's
C16 0510  5    failure is plainest. Clerfayt is neurotic, preoccupied,
C16 0520  2    and passive. To be human, he believes, is to seek one's
C16 0530  1    own destruction: the Freudian "death-wish" cliche inevitably
C16 0540  1    cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers.
C16 0540  9    In point of fact, the race-drivers one knows are nearly
C16 0550  8    always intelligent, healthy technicians who differ
C16 0560  4    from other technicians only in the depth of the passion
C16 0570  2    they feel for the work by which they live. A Clerfayt
C16 0570 13    may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit;
C16 0580 10    a Portago could say, as he did say to me, "If I die
C16 0590 10    tomorrow, still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years;
C16 0600  3    but I shan't die tomorrow; I'll live to be 105".
C16 0610  4       Clerfayt, transported, may think of the engine driving
C16 0620  2    his car as "a mystical beast under the hood". The Italian
C16 0630  1    master Piero Taruffi, no less sensitive, knows twice
C16 0630  9    the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to
C16 0640  9    a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter
C16 0650  6    best expressed in algebraic formulae. Clerfayt, driving,
C16 0660  1    sees himself "a volcano whose cone funneled down to
C16 0660 10    hell"; the Briton Stirling Moss, one of the greatest
C16 0670  9    virtuosi of all time, believes that ultra-fast road-circuit
C16 0680  8    driving is an art form related to ballet.
C16 0690  3       Errors in technical terminology suggest that the
C16 0700  2    over-all translation from the German may not convey
C16 0700 11    quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us.
C16 0710  7       However, my principal objection in this sort of
C16 0720  6    novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers,
C16 0730  1    pilots, submariners, atomic researchers, and all the
C16 0730  8    machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical
C16 0740  9    fatalists.
C16 0750  1       THE WEST is leaderless, according to this book.
C16 0750  9    In contrast, the East is ably led by such stalwart
C16 0770  9    heroes as Khrushchev, Tito, and Mao. Against this invincible
C16 0780  6    determination to communize the whole world stands a
C16 0790  5    group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and
C16 0800  2    each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty
C16 0800 10    for the common good of all.
C16 0810  4       It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in
C16 0820  2    most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people
C16 0820 12    do not really care about democracy or Christianity;
C16 0830  6    about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order
C16 0840  4    to keep up appearances and be considered respectable,
C16 0850  2    and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians
C16 0850 12    and believers in democracy.
C16 0860  4       But these Western countries do care about themselves.
C16 0870  3    Each feels intensely national. If, say, the Russians
C16 0880  1    intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub, then
C16 0880 11    Tom Jones would fight the Commies. But he would fight
C16 0890  9    for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle
C16 0900  6    connected with it- such as "cause". For all practical
C16 0910  4    purposes, the West stands disunited, undedicated, and
C16 0920  2    unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.
C16 0920  9       With this barrage, Montgomery of Alamein launches
C16 0930  7    his attack upon the blunderings of the West. Never
C16 0940  6    given to mincing words, he places heavy blame upon
C16 0950  3    the faulty, uncourageous leadership of Britain and
C16 0950 10    particularly America. At war's end leadership in Western
C16 0960  8    Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government
C16 0970  7    devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare
C16 0980  7    state. With Britain looking inward, overseas problems
C16 0990  2    were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United
C16 1000  1    States.
C16 1000  2       Montgomery believes that she started well. "America
C16 1010  1    gave generously in economic aid and military equipment
C16 1010  9    to friend and foe alike". She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken
C16 1020 10    nations into prosperity, but she failed to lead them
C16 1030  8    into unity and world peace. America has divided more
C16 1040  5    than she has united the West. The reasons are that
C16 1050  3    America generally believes that she can buy anything
C16 1050 11    with dollars, and that she compulsively strives to
C16 1060  8    be liked. However, she really does not know how to
C16 1070  7    match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality
C16 1080  3    of leadership that is basically needed.
C16 1080  9       But the greater reason for fumbling, stumbling American
C16 1090  6    leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when
C16 1100  6    the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor. "They are determined",
C16 1110  4    Montgomery writes, "not to be surprised again, and
C16 1120  3    now insist on a state of readiness for war which is
C16 1120 14    not only unnecessary, but also creates nervousness
C16 1130  7    ... among other nations in the Western Alliance- not
C16 1140  6    to mention such great suspicions among the nations
C16 1150  3    of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful
C16 1160  1    coexistence or disarmament is not possible".
C16 1160  7       The net result is that under American leadership
C16 1170  6    the general world situation has become bad. To "Monty",
C16 1180  5    the American people, who in two previous world wars
C16 1190  3    were very reluctant to join the fight, "now look like
C16 1190 13    the nation most likely to lead us all into a third
C16 1200 11    World War".
C16 1200 13    ##
C16 1210  1    AS faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United
C16 1220 10    States must be relied upon to lead. The path to leadership
C16 1230 11    is made clear. Montgomery calls for a leader who will
C16 1240  8    first put the West's own house in order. Such a man
C16 1250  7    must be able and willing to give clear and sensible
C16 1260  2    advice to the whole group, a person in whom all the
C16 1260 13    member nations will have absolute confidence. This
C16 1270  6    leader must be a man who lives above illusions that
C16 1280  4    heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United
C16 1290  3    States, namely that Russia will agree to a reunited
C16 1290 12    Germany, that the East German government does not exist,
C16 1300  9    that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired,
C16 1310  8    that the true government of China is in Formosa, that
C16 1320  7    Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the
C16 1330  4    Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960, and that either
C16 1340  2    China or Russia wants or expects war.
C16 1340  9       Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically,
C16 1350  5    and establish that true unity about which it has always
C16 1360  6    talked. After drastically overhauling NATO, Western
C16 1370  2    leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that
C16 1380  1    tear apart the East and West. Major to this effort
C16 1380 11    is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own
C16 1390  8    territories, say by 1970. "The West should make the
C16 1400  5    central proposal; but the East would have to show sincerity
C16 1410  4    in carrying it out".
C16 1410  8       "But where is the leader who will handle all these
C16 1420  7    things for us"? Montgomery knew all the national leaders
C16 1430  5    up to the time of Kennedy. The man whom he would select
C16 1440  3    as our leader for this great task is de Gaulle. He
C16 1440 14    alone has the wisdom, the conviction, the tenacity,
C16 1450  8    and the courage to reach a decision. But de Gaulle
C16 1460  6    is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul.
C16 1470  3       Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous
C16 1480  1    path to leadership. The leader Montgomery envisages
C16 1480  8    will need to discipline himself, lead a carefully regulated
C16 1490  8    and orderly life, allow time for quiet thought and
C16 1500  7    reflection, adapt decisions and plans to changing situations,
C16 1510  4    be ruthless, particularly with inefficiency, and be
C16 1520  3    honest and morally proper. All in all, Montgomery calls
C16 1520 12    for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events
C16 1530  9    that surround him.
C16 1540  1    ##
C16 1540  2    IN LOOKING as far back as Moses, thence to Cromwell,
C16 1550  1    Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, and Nehru, Montgomery
C16 1550  7    attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great
C16 1560  9    men. He believes that greatness is a marriage between
C16 1570  6    the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill,
C16 1580  3    who would very possibly have gone down in history as
C16 1590  2    a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's
C16 1590 12    war.
C16 1600  1       However, Montgomery makes little contribution to
C16 1600  7    leadership theory and practice. Most of what is said
C16 1610  8    about his great men of history has already been said,
C16 1620  5    and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary
C16 1630  1    scene. Like Eisenhower, he holds the militarist's suspicion
C16 1640  1    of politicians. However, at the same time Montgomery
C16 1640  9    selects as his hero de Gaulle, who is a militarist
C16 1650  9    dominated by political ambitions. "Monty" shows a remarkable
C16 1660  5    capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable
C16 1670  5    incapacity for giving adequate support. For the most
C16 1680  4    part, his writing rambles and jogs, preventing easy
C16 1680 12    access by the reader to his true thoughts.
C16 1690  8       Nevertheless, Montgomery has stated courageously
C16 1700  4    and wisely the crisis of the Western world. It suffers
C16 1710  3    from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic
C16 1710 14    leadership. And it remains to be seen if the new frontier
C16 1720 11    now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom
C16 1730  7    necessary to understand the current shape of events.
C16 1750  1       IT IS no common thing for a listener (critical or
C16 1750 11    otherwise) to hear a singer "live" for the first time
C16 1760 10    only after he has died. But then, Mario Lanza was no
C16 1770  9    common singer, and his whole career, public and non-public,
C16 1780  6    was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings
C16 1790  2    that terminate with the appearance of his first "recital"
C16 1800  1    only when he has ceased to be a living voice. It is
C16 1800 13    a kind of justice, too, that it should originate in
C16 1810  9    London's Royal Albert Hall, where, traditionally, the
C16 1820  5    loudest, if not the greatest, performers have entertained
C16 1830  3    the thousands it will accommodate (RCA Victor LM
C16 1840  2    2454, $4.98).
C16 1840  4       To be sure, Lanza made numerous concert tours, here
C16 1850  3    and abroad, but these did not take him to New York
C16 1860  1    where the carping critic might lurk.
