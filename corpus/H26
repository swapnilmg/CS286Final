H26 0010  1       When the Brown + Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached
H26 0010  9    its 125th year as a going industrial concern during
H26 0020  9    1958, it became an almost unique institution in the
H26 0030  5    mechanical world.
H26 0030  7       With its history standing astride all but the very
H26 0040  7    beginnings of the industrial revolution, Brown + Sharpe
H26 0050  4    has become over the years a singular monument to the
H26 0060  3    mechanical foresight of its founder, Joseph R. Brown,
H26 0060 11    and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress
H26 0070  9    in metalworking technology.
H26 0080  1       Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise
H26 0090  1    of New England between 1810 and 1830. He was early
H26 0090 11    exposed to the mechanical world, and in his youth often
H26 0100  9    helped his father, David Brown, master clock and watchmaker,
H26 0110  6    as he plied his trade. At the age of 17 he became an
H26 0120  7    apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott + Harris
H26 0130  2    in Valley Falls, Rhode Island, and following two or
H26 0130 11    three other jobs in quick succession after graduation,
H26 0140  8    he went into business for himself in 1831, making lathes
H26 0150  7    and small tools. This enterprise led to a father-and-son
H26 0160  7    combination beginning in 1833, under the name D. Brown
H26 0170  3    + Son, a business which eventually grew into the modern
H26 0180  1    corporation we now call Brown + Sharpe.
H26 0180  8       The years of Joseph's partnership with his father
H26 0190  5    were numbered. In 1838, a devastating fire gutted their
H26 0200  4    small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west
H26 0210  2    to Illinois, settling on a land grant in his declining
H26 0210 12    years.
H26 0220  1       Joseph Brown continued in business by himself, quickly
H26 0220  9    rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in
H26 0230  8    the fire and beginning those first steps which were
H26 0240  5    to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards
H26 0250  2    of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the
H26 0250 10    world.
H26 0260  1       Much of his genius, of course, sprang from his familiarity
H26 0260 11    with clock movements. During these early years the
H26 0270  8    repair of watches and clocks and the building of special
H26 0280  7    clocks for church steeples formed an important part
H26 0290  4    of the young man's occupation. He became particularly
H26 0300  1    interested in graduating and precision measurement
H26 0300  7    during the 1840's, and his thinking along these lines
H26 0310  7    developed considerably during this period. But his
H26 0320  5    business also grew, and we are told that Mr. Brown
H26 0330  2    found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time
H26 0340  8    to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him
H26 0350  8    to desire. It must have been with some pleasure and
H26 0360  6    relief that on September 12, 1848, Joseph Brown made
H26 0370  3    the momentous entry in his job book, in his characteristically
H26 0380  1    cryptic style, "Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this
H26 0380 11    day as an apprentice".
H26 0390  4       The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr.
H26 0400  3    Brown, for in the third year of his apprenticeship
H26 0400 12    Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm;
H26 0410  9    the company became "J. R. Brown + Sharpe", and entered
H26 0420  7    into a new and important period of its development.
H26 0430  5    Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide
H26 0440  4    what Mr. Brown had most coveted- time for "tinkering",
H26 0450  1    and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room
H26 0450 11    those developments in precision graduation which most
H26 0460  7    interested him at that time.
H26 0470  2       By 1853, the new partnership announced the precision
H26 0480  1    vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts.
H26 0480 11    The basic significance of this invention helped them
H26 0490  7    to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of
H26 0500  5    a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine.
H26 0510  2    That development, in turn, formed the foundation of
H26 0510 10    still more significant expansions in later years- in
H26 0520  7    gear cutting, in circular graduating, in index drilling,
H26 0530  5    and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount
H26 0540  4    requirement.
H26 0540  5       Throughout their careers, both Mr. Brown and Mr.
H26 0550  5    Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up
H26 0560  2    standards of measurement for the mechanical trades.
H26 0560  9    Several efforts were made in this direction, and though
H26 0570  9    not all of them survive to this day, the Brown + Sharpe
H26 0580  8    wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American
H26 0590  4    standard and is still in common use today.
H26 0600  1       As one development followed another, the company's
H26 0600  8    reputation for precision in the graduating field brought
H26 0610  7    it broader and broader opportunities for expansion
H26 0620  3    in precision manufacture. In 1858, the partnership
H26 0630  1    began manufacturing the Willcox + Gibbs sewing machine.
H26 0640  1       As the story goes, Mr. Gibbs, who originally came
H26 0640 10    from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia,
H26 0650  7    saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe
H26 0660  6    sewing machine. Curious as to what made it work, he
H26 0670  4    built a crude model of it in wood, and filed a piece
H26 0670 16    of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup
H26 0680  9    for the thread, enabling the crude machine to take
H26 0690  6    stitches. When he showed this model as his "solution"
H26 0700  2    as to how the Howe sewing machine operated, he was
H26 0710  1    told he was "wrong", and discovered to his amazement
H26 0710 10    that the Howe Machine, which was unknown to him in
H26 0720  8    detail, used two threads while the one that he had
H26 0730  6    perfected used only one. Thus was invented the single
H26 0740  2    thread sewing machine, which Mr. Gibbs in partnership
H26 0740 10    with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown + Sharpe
H26 0750 10    with the proposal that the small company undertake
H26 0760  6    its manufacture.
H26 0760  8       The new work was a boon to the partnership, not
H26 0770  8    only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation
H26 0780  4    it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward
H26 0790  3    yet further developments for production equipment.
H26 0790  9       The turret screw machine, now known as the Brown
H26 0800 10    + Sharpe hand screw machine, takes its ancestry directly
H26 0810  7    from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to
H26 0820  5    simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine. Mr.
H26 0830  3    Brown made important additions to the arts in screw
H26 0830 12    machine design by drastically improving the means for
H26 0840  8    revolving the turret, by introducing automatic feeding
H26 0850  5    devices for the stock, and reversible tap and die holders.
H26 0860  5       In 1861, Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet
H26 0870  5    another basic production problem- the manufacture of
H26 0880  2    twist drills. At that time, during the Civil War, Union
H26 0880 12    muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the
H26 0890  8    drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail
H26 0900  7    files. This process neither satisfied the urgent production
H26 0910  4    schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities
H26 0920  4    in the situation. The child of this problem was Mr.
H26 0930  2    Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine,
H26 0940  1    the archtype from which is descended today's universal
H26 0940  9    knee-type milling machine used throughout the world.
H26 0950  7    The original machine, bearing its famous serial number,
H26 0960  5    is still on exhibition at the Brown + Sharpe Precision
H26 0970  2    Center in Providence.
H26 0970  5       During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented
H26 0980  6    the Brown + Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter, a basic
H26 0990  5    invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's
H26 1000  1    gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics.
H26 1010  1    Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters
H26 1010 12    for making gear teeth, but they were good for only
H26 1020  8    one sharpening. As soon as the time came for re-sharpening,
H26 1030  6    the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new
H26 1040  4    cutter had to be made. This process made the economical
H26 1050  1    manufacture of gears questionable until some way could
H26 1050  9    be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear
H26 1060  7    tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form.
H26 1070  5    Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and, as a byproduct,
H26 1080  4    formed the cornerstone of Brown + Sharpe's position
H26 1090  1    of leadership in the gear making equipment field which
H26 1090 10    lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods.
H26 1100  8       The micrometer caliper, as a common workshop tool,
H26 1110  7    also owes much to J. R. Brown. Although Mr. Brown was
H26 1120  5    not himself its inventor (it was a French idea), it
H26 1130  3    is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance
H26 1140  1    of mass producing this basic tool for general use.
H26 1140 10    So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first
H26 1150  9    saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868,
H26 1160  7    they brought a sample with them to the United States
H26 1170  3    and started Brown + Sharpe in yet another field where
H26 1180  1    it retains its leadership to this day.
H26 1180  8       The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting
H26 1190  7    mechanical career runs a close second in importance
H26 1200  5    to his development of the universal milling machine.
H26 1210  2    That achievement was his creation of the universal
H26 1210 10    grinding machine, which made its appearance in 1876
H26 1220  8    at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. This machine,
H26 1230  4    like its milling counterpart, was the antecedent of
H26 1240  4    a machine-family used to this very day in precision
H26 1250  1    metalworking shops throughout the world. Along with
H26 1250  8    J. R. Brown's other major developments, the universal
H26 1260  6    grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting
H26 1270  4    the course of Brown + Sharpe for many years to come.
H26 1280  4       Following Mr. Brown's death, there came forward
H26 1290  2    in the Brown + Sharpe organization many other men who
H26 1290 12    contributed greatly to the development of the company.
H26 1300  8    One such man was Samuel Darling.
H26 1310  2       As head of the firm Darling + Swartz, Mr. Darling
H26 1320  2    began by challenging Brown + Sharpe to its keenest
H26 1320 11    competition during the 1850's and early 60's. In 1868,
H26 1330  9    however, a truce was called between the companies,
H26 1340  6    and the partnership of Darling, brown + Sharpe was
H26 1350  4    formed. Between that year and the buying out of Mr.
H26 1360  1    Darling's interest in 1892, a large portion of the
H26 1360 10    company's precision tool business was carried out under
H26 1370  7    the name of Darling, Brown + Sharpe, and to this day
H26 1380  7    many old precision tools are in use still bearing that
H26 1390  3    famous trademark.
H26 1390  5       Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's
H26 1400  5    tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale, whose
H26 1410  4    mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown,
H26 1420  3    and whose particular forte was the development of the
H26 1420 12    exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled
H26 1430  6    Brown + Sharpe to manufacture gages, and therefore
H26 1440  6    its products, with an accuracy exceeding anything then
H26 1450  3    available elsewhere in the world.
H26 1450  8       Also important on the Brown + Sharpe scene, at the
H26 1460  9    turn of the century, was Mr. Richmond Viall, Works
H26 1470  5    Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910. Mr.
H26 1480  5    Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership
H26 1490  1    and development of men. He was an ardent champion of
H26 1490 11    the Brown + Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal
H26 1500  7    counselor to countless able men who first developed
H26 1510  5    their industrial talents with the company. In one sense
H26 1520  4    it can be said that one of the most important Brown
H26 1520 15    + Sharpe products over the years has been the men who
H26 1530 10    began work with the company and subsequently came to
H26 1540  6    places of industrial eminence throughout the nation
H26 1550  3    and even abroad.
H26 1550  6       Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899,
H26 1560  5    the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years
H26 1570  4    closely interwoven with the destiny of the company.
H26 1570 12    During his presidency, the company's physical plant
H26 1580  7    was enormously expanded, and the length and breadth
H26 1590  6    of the Brown + Sharpe machine tool line became the
H26 1600  4    greatest in the world. During the early part of this
H26 1610  1    century, the Brown + Sharpe works in Providence were
H26 1610 10    unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility
H26 1620  7    devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool
H26 1630  5    manufacture anywhere in the world.
H26 1640  1       During these years the company's product line followed
H26 1640  8    the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown. It expanded
H26 1650  8    from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines,
H26 1670  5    from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear
H26 1680  3    hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing
H26 1690  1    business, from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling
H26 1690  8    machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled
H26 1700  7    knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines.
H26 1710  3    In the grinding machine field, expansion went far from
H26 1720  2    universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders,
H26 1720 10    surface grinders, and a wide variety of special and
H26 1730  9    semi-special models.
H26 1740  1       In 1951, Henry D. Sharpe, Jr. succeeded his father
H26 1740 10    and continued the company's development as a major
H26 1760  7    factor in the metal-working equipment business. The
H26 1770  4    company is still broadening its line and is now active
H26 1780  4    on four major fronts.
H26 1780  8       The Machine Tool Division is currently producing
H26 1790  4    Brown + Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines,
H26 1800  2    grinding machines of many types, and knee and bed-type
H26 1810  1    milling machines. Recently added is the Brown + Sharpe
H26 1810 10    turret drilling machine which introduces the company
H26 1820  6    to an entirely new field of tool development.
H26 1830  2       In the Industrial Products Division, the company
H26 1840  1    manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging
H26 1840 10    and inspection equipment, machinists' tools- including
H26 1850  5    micrometers, Vernier calipers, and accessories.
H26 1860  4       In the Cutting Tool Division, the principal products
H26 1870  4    include a wide variety of high speed steel milling
H26 1880  1    cutters, end mills and saws.
