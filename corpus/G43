G43 0010  1       Two facets of this aspect of the literary process
G43 0010 10    have special significance for our time. One, a reservation
G43 0020  8    on the point I have just made, is the phenomenon of
G43 0030  6    pseudo-thinking, pseudo-feeling, and pseudo-willing,
G43 0040  1    which Fromm discussed in The Escape from Freedom. In
G43 0050  2    essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion
G43 0050 10    in the values and experience of others, rather than
G43 0060  8    in one's own values and experience. There is a risk
G43 0070  7    that instead of teaching a person how to be himself,
G43 0090  1    reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody
G43 0100  1    else. Clearly what the person brings to the reading
G43 0100 10    is important. Moreover, if the critic instructs his
G43 0110  7    audience in what to see in a work, he is contributing
G43 0120  6    to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs them in how
G43 0130  4    to evaluate a work, he is helping them to achieve their
G43 0140  1    own identity.
G43 0140  3       The second timely part of this sketch of literature
G43 0150  1    and the search for identity has to do with the difference
G43 0150 12    between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral
G43 0160  9    mass culture products of today. In the range and variety
G43 0170  8    of characters who, in their literary lives, get along
G43 0180  5    all right with life styles one never imagined possible,
G43 0190  2    there is an implicit lesson in differentiation. The
G43 0190 10    reader, observing this process, might ask "why not
G43 0200  8    be different"? and find in the answer a license to
G43 0210  8    be a variant of the human species. The observer of
G43 0220  4    television or other products for a mass audience has
G43 0230  1    only a permit to be, like the models he sees, even
G43 0230 12    more like everybody else. And this, I think, holds
G43 0240  7    for values as well as life styles. One would need to
G43 0250  5    test this proposition carefully; after all, the large
G43 0260  1    (and probably unreliable) Reader's Digest literature
G43 0260  7    on the "most unforgettable character I ever met" deals
G43 0270  8    with village grocers, country doctors, favorite if
G43 0280  5    illiterate aunts, and so forth. Scientists often turn
G43 0290  3    out to be idiosyncratic, too. But still, the proposition
G43 0300  1    is worth examination.
G43 0300  4       It is possible that the study of literature affects
G43 0310  4    the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to some
G43 0320  2    code of "right" and "wrong". I do not know that this
G43 0320 13    is true; both Flu^gel and Ranyard West deal with the
G43 0330 10    development and nature of conscience, as do such theologians
G43 0340  9    as Niebuhr and Buber. It forms the core of many, perhaps
G43 0350  8    most, problems of psychotherapy. I am not aware of
G43 0360  6    great attention by any of these authors or by the
G43 0370  1    psychotherapeutic
G43 0370  2    profession to the role of literary study in the development
G43 0380  1    of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate
G43 0390  1    period of life, or, for the theologians of course,
G43 0390 10    to the influence of religion.
G43 0400  3       Still, it would be surprising if what one reads
G43 0400 12    did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong;
G43 0410 10    certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and
G43 0420  8    the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate
G43 0430  3    some peripheral aspects of this influence. Probably
G43 0440  2    the most important thing to focus on is not the development
G43 0450  1    of conscience, which may well be almost beyond the
G43 0450 10    reach of literature, but the contents of conscience,
G43 0460  6    the code which is imparted to the developed or immature
G43 0470  3    conscience available. This is in large part a code
G43 0480  1    of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that
G43 0480 12    people do and should do and how one should regard it.
G43 0490  9    In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century
G43 0500  5    novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature
G43 0510  4    as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with
G43 0520  3    the way a girl learned to meet her lover, how to behave,
G43 0520 15    how to think about this new experience, how to exercise
G43 0530 10    restraint.
G43 0540  1       Literature may be said to give people a sense of
G43 0540 11    purpose, dedication, mission, significance. This, no
G43 0550  5    doubt, is part of what Gilbert Seldes implies when
G43 0560  3    he says of the arts, "They give form and meaning to
G43 0570  2    life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without
G43 0570 10    sense". Men seem almost universally to want a sense
G43 0580  8    of function, that is, a feeling that their existence
G43 0590  4    makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, close
G43 0600  2    and immediate or generalized. Feeling useless seems
G43 0600  9    generally to be an unpleasant sensation. A need so
G43 0610  9    deeply planted, asking for direction, so to speak,
G43 0620  6    is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and
G43 0630  2    heroic proportions of literature. The terms "renewal"
G43 0640  1    and "refreshed", which often come up in aesthetic discussion,
G43 0640 10    seem partly to derive their import from the "renewal"
G43 0650  9    of purpose and a "refreshed" sense of significance
G43 0660  6    a person may receive from poetry, drama, and fiction.
G43 0670  4    The notion of "inspiration" is somehow cognate to this
G43 0680  3    feeling. How literature does this, or for whom, is
G43 0680 12    certainly not clear, but the content, form, and language
G43 0690  9    of the "message", as well as the source, would all
G43 0700  8    play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense
G43 0710  5    of purpose.
G43 0710  7       One of the most salient features of literary value
G43 0720  4    has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization
G43 0730  2    of emotion. Let us differentiate a few of these ideas.
G43 0730 12    The Aristotelian notion of catharsis, the purging of
G43 0740  8    emotion, is a persistent and viable one. The idea here
G43 0750  7    is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition
G43 0760  5    to a second view, Plato's notion of the arousal of
G43 0770  3    emotion. A third idea is that artistic literature serves
G43 0780  1    to reduce emotional conflicts, giving a sense of serenity
G43 0780 10    and calm to individuals. This is given some expression
G43 0790  9    in Beardsley's notion of harmony and the resolution
G43 0800  7    of indecision. A fourth view is the transformation
G43 0810  3    of emotion, as in Housman's fine phrase on the arts:
G43 0820  2    they "transform and beautify our inner nature". It
G43 0820 10    is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion
G43 0830  8    is a fifth idea. F.S.C. Northrop, in his discussion
G43 0840  5    of the "Functions and Future of Poetry", suggests this:
G43 0850  5    "One of the things which makes our lives drab and empty
G43 0860  6    and which leaves us, at the end of the day, fatigued
G43 0870  2    and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing,
G43 0870 11    practical, utilitarian concern of common-sense objects.
G43 0880  7    If art is to release us from these postulated things
G43 0890  6    [things we must think symbolically about] and bring
G43 0900  4    us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the
G43 0910  1    aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy, it
G43 0910  9    must sever its connection with these common sense entities".
G43 0920  6    I take the central meaning here to be the contrast
G43 0930  6    between the drab empty quality of life without literature
G43 0940  2    and a life enriched by it. Richards' view of the aesthetic
G43 0950  1    experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him
G43 0950  9    it constitutes, in part, the organization of impulses.
G43 0960  7       A sketch of the emotional value of the study of
G43 0970  8    literature would have to take account of all of these.
G43 0980  5    But there is one in particular which, it seems to me,
G43 0990  3    deserves special attention. In the wide range of experiences
G43 1000  1    common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult
G43 1000 11    to manage, more troublesome, and more enduring in its
G43 1010  7    effects than the control of love and hate. The study
G43 1020  5    of literature contributes to this control in a curious
G43 1030  1    way. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, it seems to
G43 1030 10    me, have a penetrating insight into the way in which
G43 1040  9    this control is effected: "For if we say poetry is
G43 1050  7    to talk of beauty and love (and yet not aim at exciting
G43 1060  4    erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem)
G43 1070  1    and if it is to talk of anger and murder (and yet not
G43 1070 14    aim at arousing anger and indignation)- then it may
G43 1080  7    be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions
G43 1090  4    will not be any kind of intensification, compounding,
G43 1100  1    or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections
G43 1110  1    at all. Something indirect, mixed, reconciling, tensional
G43 1110  8    might well be the strategem, the devious technique
G43 1120  7    by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about
G43 1130  5    love and anger and even in something like "expressions"
G43 1140  1    of these emotions, without aiming at their incitement
G43 1140  9    or even uttering anything that essentially involves
G43 1150  7    their incitement". The rehearsal through literature
G43 1160  5    of emotional life under controlled conditions may be
G43 1170  3    a most valuable human experience. Here I do not mean
G43 1180  1    catharsis, the discharge of emotion. I mean something
G43 1180  9    more like Freud's concept of the utility of "play"
G43 1190  7    to a small child: he plays "house" or "doctor" or "fireman"
G43 1200  6    as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences,
G43 1210  4    reliving them imaginatively until they are under control.
G43 1220  4       There is a second feature of the influences of literature,
G43 1230  3    good literature, on emotional life which may have some
G43 1240  2    special value for our time. In B. M. Spinley's portrayal
G43 1250  1    of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London,
G43 1250  9    a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification,
G43 1260  8    a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the
G43 1270  5    pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience.
G43 1280  3    Perhaps it is only an analogy, but one of the most
G43 1290  1    obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction
G43 1290  8    of an enduring quality is the development of a theme
G43 1300  8    or story with leisure and anticipation. Anyone who
G43 1310  3    has watched children develop a taste for literature
G43 1320  1    will understand what I mean. It is at least possible
G43 1320 11    that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed
G43 1330  6    as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure
G43 1340  6    to great literature.
G43 1340  9       In any inquiry into the way in which great literature
G43 1350  9    affects the emotions, particularly with respect to
G43 1360  4    the sense of harmony, or relief of tension, or sense
G43 1370  3    of "a transformed inner nature" which may occur, a
G43 1370 12    most careful exploration of the particular feature
G43 1380  7    of the experience which produces the effect would be
G43 1390  6    required. In the calm which follows the reading of
G43 1400  3    a poem, for example, is the effect produced by the
G43 1400 13    enforced quiet, by the musical quality of words and
G43 1410  9    rhythm, by the sentiments or sense of the poem, by
G43 1420  7    the associations with earlier readings, if it is familiar,
G43 1430  3    by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate,
G43 1435  1    by the diversion of attention, by the sense of security
G43 1440 10    in a legitimized withdrawal, by a kind license for
G43 1450  7    some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden,
G43 1460  3    or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power
G43 1460 12    of words? These are, if the research is done with subtlety
G43 1470 11    and skill, researchable topics, but the research is
G43 1480  7    missing.
G43 1480  8       One of the most frequent views of the value of literature
G43 1490  9    is the education of sensibility that it is thought
G43 1500  5    to provide. Sensibility is a vague word, covering an
G43 1510  3    area of meaning rather than any precise talent, quality,
G43 1520  1    or skill. Among other things it means perception, discrimination,
G43 1520 10    sensitivity to subtle differences. Both the extent
G43 1530  7    to which this is true and the limits of the field of
G43 1540  8    perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged. Its
G43 1550  2    truth is illustrated by the skill, sensitivity, and
G43 1550 10    general expertise of the English professor with whom
G43 1560  8    one attends the theatre. The limits are suggested by
G43 1570  6    an imaginary experiment: contrast the perceptual skill
G43 1580  4    of English professors with that of their colleagues
G43 1590  1    in discriminating among motor cars, political candidates,
G43 1590  8    or female beauty. Along these lines, the particular
G43 1600  7    point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity
G43 1610  6    in human relations would require more proof than I
G43 1620  4    have seen. In a symposium and general exploration of
G43 1630  1    the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior
G43 1630  9    the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the
G43 1640 10    subject, with one possible exception; Solomon Asch
G43 1650  5    shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based
G43 1660  4    on sensation (hot, sweet, bitter, etc.) dealing with
G43 1670  2    personal qualities of human beings and events. But
G43 1670 10    to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive
G43 1680  8    to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive
G43 1690  5    to personal differences is too great an inferential
G43 1700  1    leap.
G43 1700  2       I would say, too, that the study of literature tends
G43 1710  2    to give a person what I shall call depth. I use this
G43 1710 14    term to mean three things: a search for the human significance
G43 1720 11    of an event or state of affairs, a tendency to look
G43 1730  9    at wholes rather than parts, and a tendency to respond
G43 1740  6    to these events and wholes with feeling. It is the
G43 1750  3    obverse of triviality, shallowness, emotional anaesthesia.
G43 1750  9    I think these attributes cluster, but I have no evidence.
G43 1760 10    In fact, I can only say this seems to me to follow
G43 1770 10    from a wide, continuous, and properly guided exposure
G43 1780  4    to literary art.
