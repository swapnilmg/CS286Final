A31 0010  1       HOTEL ESCAPE'S Bonanza room has a real bonanza in
A31 0020  1    its new attraction, the versatile "Kings IV Plus Two".
A31 0030  1       This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long
A31 0030 13    while- a well integrated, fast moving outfit specializing
A31 0040  6    in skits, vocals, comedy and instrumentals all of it
A31 0050  6    distinctly displaying the pro touch.
A31 0060  1       Show spotlights the Kings- George Worth, Bill Kay,
A31 0060  9    Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson, flanked by Dave Grossman
A31 0070  9    and Ron Stevens.
A31 0080  1       The plus two remain at a fixed position with drums
A31 0090  1    and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a
A31 0090 11    batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine,
A31 0100  6    and the beat is solid.
A31 0100 11       In the comedy division, the Kings simply augmenting
A31 0110  8    talent and imagination with a few props. Net result
A31 0120  7    is some crazy-wonderful nonsense, part of which can
A31 0130  4    be classed as pure slapstick.
A31 0130  9       Kings IV have rated as a popular act in Vegas and
A31 0140 10    Western nightclubs. If they can't chalk up BIG business
A31 0150  6    here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are,
A31 0160  6    and stick to our community singing, @

A31 0290  2    #WE LIKE FIKE#
A31 0290  5    AL FIKE, an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado, is currently
A31 0300  4    pursuing the three R's- rhythm, reminiscence and repartee-
A31 0310  3    in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel.
A31 0320  2       Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes
A31 0320 12    for a smoother operation but it's substantially the
A31 0330  8    same format heard last spring.
A31 0340  3       Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano, Wes Robbins,
A31 0350  1    bass and trumpet, and Jack Kelly on drums. It's a solid
A31 0350 12    show but, except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie,
A31 0360  9    it's Al's all the way.
A31 0370  4       Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality,
A31 0380  1    and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience.
A31 0380 11    He skips around from jazz, to blues to boogie- accompanying
A31 0390 10    himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers
A31 0400  7    in on the act.
A31 0400 11       This is a bouncy show which may get a little too
A31 0410 11    frantic at times, but is nevertheless worth your appraisal.

A31 1080  3       - A series of high school assemblies to acquaint
A31 1090  1    junior and senior students with the Junior Achievement
A31 1090  9    program begins at St. Thomas Aquinas Monday.
A31 1100  6       Subsequent assemblies will be held at Stranahan
A31 1110  6    High School Tuesday, at Pompano Beach High Wednesday,
A31 1120  3    and at Fort Lauderdale high Thursday.
A31 1120  9       The business education program operates with the
A31 1130  7    cooperation of local high schools and business firms.
A31 1150  1       Is there anything a frustrated individual can do
A31 1150  9    about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and
A31 1160  7    around the world?
A31 1170  1       More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there
A31 1170  9    is and as many more are expected to prove it again
A31 1180  7    for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday
A31 1190  6    at First Presbyterian Church.
A31 1190 10       At that time the second half of the Christian Youth
A31 1200  9    Crusade against Communism will be staged. A young real
A31 1210  7    estate salesman, Kern first got seriously interested
A31 1220  4    in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy
A31 1230  2    Air Force. He was particularly struck by a course on
A31 1230 12    Communist brainwashing.
A31 1240  2       Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy
A31 1250  3    of Communism, but never felt there was anything he,
A31 1260  1    as an individual, could do about it.
A31 1260  8       When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade
A31 1270  4    school here about six months ago, Jim became convinced
A31 1280  4    that an individual can do something constructive in
A31 1300  2    the ideological battle and set out to do it.
A31 1300 11       The best approach, he figured, was to try to influence
A31 1310  8    young people like the high schoolers he and his wife
A31 1320  6    serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.
A31 1330  1       And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only
A31 1330 12    learn about Communist but also about what he feels
A31 1340  9    is the only antidote- a Biblically strong Christianity.
A31 1350  7       So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn
A31 1360  5    developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult
A31 1370  4    advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat
A31 1380  1    enthralled at the four-hour program.
A31 1380  7       This Sunday those attending the second session will
A31 1390  5    hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation; a review
A31 1400  3    of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack,
A31 1410  1    another real estate agent who became interested as
A31 1410  9    a philosophy major at the University of Miami; and
A31 1420  8    talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in
A31 1430  6    learning about and fighting Communism during high school
A31 1440  3    and college days, by Ted Place, director of Greater
A31 1440 12    Miami Youth for Christ, and Jon Braun, director of
A31 1450  9    Campus Crusade for Christ.
A31 1460  3       The second half of the film "Communism on the Map"
A31 1470  3    and the movie "Operation Abolition" also will be shown.
A31 1480  1       Response to the program has been so encouraging,
A31 1480  9    Kern said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County
A31 1490 11    Auditorium may be set up soon.
A31 1500  4       And to encourage other churches to try their own
A31 1510  1    programs, Kern said this Sunday's sessions- including
A31 1510  8    the free dinner- will be open to anyone who makes reservations.
A31 1530  1       The need for and the way to achieve a Christian
A31 1530 11    home will be stressed in special services marking National
A31 1540  7    Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week.
A31 1550  7       Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter
A31 1560  4    family, 3181 SW 24th Ter., will be the Family Dedication
A31 1570  3    Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian
A31 1580  3    Church.
A31 1580  4       It will be the second time the assistant manager
A31 1590  4    of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken
A31 1600  2    part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with
A31 1600 12    new babies.
A31 1610  1       The first one, two years ago, changed the routine
A31 1610 10    of their home life.
A31 1620  3       "When you stand up in public and take vows to strive
A31 1630  2    to set an example before your children and to teach
A31 1630 12    them the fundamentals of the Christian faith, you strive
A31 1640  8    a little harder to uphold those vows", explains the
A31 1650  5    slender vice president of the young couples Sunday
A31 1670  2    school class.
A31 1670  4       Until that first dedication service, he and Lois
A31 1680  4    felt their children were too young to take part in
A31 1690  1    any religious life at home. They have five daughters-
A31 1690 10    Coral Lee, 5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and
A31 1700 10    Shari, five months.
A31 1710  1       But after that service, they decided to try to let
A31 1710 11    the girls say grace at the table, have bedtime prayers,
A31 1720  8    and Bible stories. To their surprise, the children
A31 1730  4    all were eager and quite able to take part. Even the
A31 1740  3    two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time
A31 1740 15    without her.
