F19 0010  1    THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT
F19 0010 10    PROPORTION to the popularity of nationalism in America.
F19 0020  8    And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion
F19 0030  6    to the growth of American influence across the world.
F19 0040  4    Thus, if we are to observe American folklore in the
F19 0050  3    twentieth century, we will do well to establish the
F19 0050 12    relationships between folklore, nationalism and imperialism
F19 0060  6    at the outset.
F19 0070  1       Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts
F19 0070  9    concerning nationalism and international influence.
F19 0080  4    1) Every age rewrites the events of its history in
F19 0090  5    terms of what should have been, creating legends about
F19 0100  2    itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse
F19 0100  9    contemporary actions. What actually occurred in the
F19 0110  7    past is seldom as important as what a given generation
F19 0120  6    feels must have occurred. 2) As a country superimposes
F19 0130  2    its cultural and political attitudes on others, it
F19 0130 10    searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.
F19 0140  9    Its folklore and legend, usually disguised as history,
F19 0150  7    are allowed to account for group actions, to provide
F19 0160  6    a focal point for group loyalty, and to become a cohesive
F19 0170  4    force for national identification.
F19 0170  8       One can apply these facts to Britain in the late
F19 0180  8    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her
F19 0190  5    dominion over palm and pine, and they can be applied
F19 0200  2    again to the United States in more recent years. The
F19 0200 12    popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American
F19 0210  9    War, the steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased
F19 0220  9    emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are
F19 0230  8    cases in point. Nor is it an accident that baseball,
F19 0240  3    growing into the national game in the last 75 years,
F19 0250  1    has become a microcosm of American life, that learned
F19 0250 10    societies such as the American Folklore Society and
F19 0260  7    the American Historical Association were founded in
F19 0270  5    the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,
F19 0280  1    American civilization, American anything have swept
F19 0280  7    our school and college curricula.
F19 0290  4       Of course, nationalism has really outlived its usefulness
F19 0300  4    in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its continued
F19 0310  2    existence reflects one of the major culture lags of
F19 0310 11    the twentieth-century United States. Yet nationalism
F19 0320  5    has lost few of its charms for the historian, writer
F19 0330  6    or man in the street. It is an understandable paradox
F19 0340  2    that most American history and most American literature
F19 0350  1    is today written from an essentially egocentric and
F19 0350  9    isolationistic point of view at the very time America
F19 0360  9    is spreading her dominion over palm and pine. After
F19 0370  6    all, the average American as he lies and waits for
F19 0380  3    the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in
F19 0380 14    some vain hope of personal contact with the front is
F19 0390  9    unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of
F19 0400  7    a complex of personal, economic and governmental actions
F19 0410  2    far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.
F19 0420  1    Anyone's identification with an international struggle,
F19 0420  7    whether warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification
F19 0430  7    and intense emotional involvement. Such identification
F19 0440  5    comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history
F19 0450  5    into legend and developing appropriate national heroes.
F19 0460  3       In America, such self-deception has served a particularly
F19 0470  3    useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed
F19 0470 10    it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion
F19 0480 10    in a new and ever-changing land. But we must never
F19 0490  6    forget, most of the appropriate heroes and their legends
F19 0500  5    were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,
F19 0510  1    almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson
F19 0510  9    Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty
F19 0520  7    and the father image of the uniting States. Abraham
F19 0530  5    Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution.
F19 0540  4    Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling
F19 0550  5    confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by those
F19 0560  2    of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy
F19 0560 10    Crockett, Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.
F19 0570  7       Therefore, the scholar, as he looks at our national
F19 0580  8    folklore of the last 60 years, will be mindful of two
F19 0590  6    facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created to fan
F19 0600  3    the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic
F19 0600 10    and are not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that
F19 0610 10    an "American national folklore" exists is itself probably
F19 0620  6    another propagandistic legend.
F19 0630  1       Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous
F19 0630  9    group of people preserve, vary and recreate through
F19 0640  8    oral transmission. It has come to mean myths, legends,
F19 0650  7    tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, rhymes
F19 0660  2    and such literary forms of expression. Related to written
F19 0670  2    literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen
F19 0670  8    in written form, it loses its vitality when transcribed
F19 0680  8    or removed from its oral existence. Though it may exist
F19 0690  6    in either literate or illiterate societies, it assumes
F19 0700  3    a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.
F19 0710  1       In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover
F19 0710  9    our folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant
F19 0720  8    of definitions such as this. Enthusiastically, Americans
F19 0730  4    have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul
F19 0740  4    Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union
F19 0750  2    songs up as true products of our American oral tradition.
F19 0750 12    Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America
F19 0760 11    the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic,
F19 0770  6    regional and occupational groups did not fuse into
F19 0780  4    a homogeneous national unit until long after education
F19 0785  1    and industrialization had caused them to cast oral
F19 0790  7    tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant
F19 0800  7    material.
F19 0800  8       Naturally, such scholarly facts are of little concern
F19 0810  8    to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by
F19 0820  6    means of folklore. That much of what he calls folklore
F19 0830  3    is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people
F19 0840  1    with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass
F19 0840 10    emotional reaction to a particular situation or set
F19 0850  7    of situations is irrelevant. As long as his material
F19 0860  4    is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses
F19 0870  1    and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains
F19 0870  9    satisfied.
F19 0880  1       From all this we can now see that two streams of
F19 0880 12    development run through the history of twentieth-century
F19 0890  8    American folklore. On the one side we have the university
F19 0900  8    professors and their students, trained in Teutonic
F19 0910  3    methods of research, who have sought out, collected
F19 0920  1    and studied the true products of the oral traditions
F19 0920 10    of the ethnic, regional and occupational groups that
F19 0930  6    make up this nation. On the other we have the flag-wavers
F19 0940  6    and the national sentimentalists who have been willing
F19 0950  2    to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial
F19 0950 10    material willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists
F19 0960  8    (writers, movie producers, dramatists and musicians)
F19 0970  5    who have used American folklore since 1900 have known
F19 0980  5    enough to distinguish between the two streams even
F19 0990  2    in the most general of ways. After all, the field is
F19 0990 13    large, difficult to define and seldom taught properly
F19 1000  7    to American undergraduates. In addition, this country
F19 1010  5    has been settled by many peoples of many heritages
F19 1020  2    and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an
F19 1020 11    age of print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding
F19 1030  9    and changing society. The problems confuse even the
F19 1040  6    experts.
F19 1040  7       For that matter, the experts themselves are a mixed
F19 1050  7    breed. Anthropologists, housewives, historians and
F19 1060  3    such by profession, they approach their discipline
F19 1070  1    as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists,
F19 1070  6    analysts or some combination of the four. They have
F19 1080  6    widely varying backgrounds and aims. They have little
F19 1090  4    "esprit de corps".
F19 1090  7       The outlook for the amateur, for instance, is usually
F19 1100  6    dependent on his fondness for local history or for
F19 1110  4    the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism
F19 1120  1    in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign
F19 1120 12    or the footnote. Folklore is his hobby, and he, all
F19 1130  8    too rightly, wishes it to remain as such. The amateur
F19 1140  5    is closely related to the collector, who is actually
F19 1150  2    no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.
F19 1150 13    The collector enjoys the contact with rural life; he
F19 1160  8    hunts folklore for the very "field and stream" reasons
F19 1170  6    that many persons hunt game; and only rarely is he
F19 1180  5    acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located.
F19 1190  2    Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the
F19 1190 10    collector, are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish
F19 1200  9    well between real folklore and bogus material.
F19 1210  6       But there are also the commercial propagandists
F19 1220  2    and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other
F19 1230  1    by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are
F19 1230  8    primarily concerned with the uses that can be made
F19 1240  8    of the material that the collector has found. Both
F19 1250  4    shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond
F19 1260  1    the sewage system and the electric light lines. The
F19 1260 10    commercial propagandist, who can't afford to be critical,
F19 1270  7    gets along well with the amateur, from whom he feeds,
F19 1280  6    but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing
F19 1290  4    to keep his material genuine. His standards are, of
F19 1300  2    course, completely foreign to those of the analyst.
F19 1300 10    To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the
F19 1310  6    analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation with his endless
F19 1320  4    probings and classifications. Dominated by the vicious
F19 1330  3    circle of the university promotion system, the analyst
F19 1330 11    looks down on and gets along poorly with the other
F19 1340 10    three groups, although he cannot deny his debt to the
F19 1350  8    collector.
F19 1350  9       The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore
F19 1360  6    comes through contact with commercial propagandists
F19 1370  2    and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work
F19 1380  1    done by the analysts, the men who really know what
F19 1380 11    folklore is all about, has no more appeal than any
F19 1390  7    other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a
F19 1400  4    limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that
F19 1410  1    will sell, recording studios want discs that will not
F19 1410 10    seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music,
F19 1420  8    grade and high schools want quaint, but moral, material.
F19 1430  4    The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in. As a
F19 1440  4    result, most people don't have more than a vague idea
F19 1440 14    what folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri
F19 1450 10    of charming, moral legends and patriotic anecdotes,
F19 1460  5    with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there.
F19 1470  5    And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur
F19 1480  1    and the money-maker that even at the college level
F19 1480 11    most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the
F19 1490  8    United States survive on sentiment and nationalism
F19 1500  3    alone.
F19 1500  4       If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses
F19 1510  4    folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize
F19 1520  1    is that the literary figure is probably part of this
F19 1520 11    ignorant American public. And while every writer must
F19 1530  7    be dealt with as a special case, the interested student
F19 1540  5    will want to ask himself a number of questions about
F19 1550  2    each. Does the writer know the difference between an
F19 1550 11    "ersatz" ballad or tall tale and a true product of
F19 1560 10    the folk? When the writer uses material does he tamper
F19 1570  8    with it to improve its commercial effect or does he
F19 1580  5    leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic? Is he
F19 1590  3    swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America
F19 1590 12    that was? Or does he sincerely want to tap the real
F19 1600 10    springs of American attitude and culture regardless
F19 1610  5    of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be?
F19 1620  3       When he gets the answers to his questions he will
F19 1620 13    be discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers
F19 1630 10    who are said to use folklore, do not, unless one counts
F19 1640  8    an occasional superstition or tale. Robert Frost, for
F19 1650  5    instance, writes about rural life in New England, but
F19 1660  2    he does not include any significant amount of folklore
F19 1660 11    in his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers
F19 1670  9    from labeling him a "folk poet", simply because he
F19 1680  8    is a rural one. In the second place, a large number
F19 1690  5    of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost to
F19 1700  2    being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly
F19 1700 11    make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.
F19 1710  8    Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately
F19 1720  7    to mind in this connection, as does John Steinbeck's
F19 1730  6    The Grapes of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People,
F19 1740  6    Yes. The last two writers introduce strong political
F19 1760  4    bias into their works, and not unlike the union leaders
F19 1770  2    that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir
F19 1770 12    of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced
F19 1780  8    mass. Folklore, as used by such writers, really reflects
F19 1790  7    images engraved into it by the very person using it.
F19 1800  4    The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to
F19 1810  2    nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much
F19 1810 11    evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything
F19 1820  9    beyond their particular regional, ethnic and occupational
F19 1830  5    limits. Nevertheless, with a reading public that longs
F19 1840  4    for the "good old days" and with an awareness of our
F19 1850  3    expanding international interests, it is easy for the
F19 1850 11    Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature
F19 1860  8    by use of all sorts of Americana, real or fake, and
F19 1870  6    it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support
F19 1880  3    their messages of reform by reading messages of reform
F19 1890  1    into the minds of the folk.
