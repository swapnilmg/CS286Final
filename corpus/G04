G04 0010  1       Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the
G04 0010  8    game ended. They went as rigid as black statuary ...
G04 0020  8    six figures, lean and tall and angular, went still.
G04 0030  4    Their heads were in the air sniffing. They all swung
G04 0040  2    at the same instant in the same direction. They saw
G04 0040 12    it before I did, even with my binoculars. It was nothing
G04 0050 10    more than a tiny distant rain squall, a dull gray sheet
G04 0060  7    which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth.
G04 0070  4    In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree,
G04 0080  1    no more. A white man would not have seen it. The aborigines
G04 0080 13    fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.
G04 0090  8    Watching, they waited until the squall thickened and
G04 0100  6    began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry
G04 0110  4    burning land. At once the whole band set off at a lope.
G04 0120  1    They were chasing a rain cloud.
G04 0120  7       They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf
G04 0130  6    pack after an abandoned cow. I followed them in the
G04 0140  3    jeep and now they did not care. The games were over,
G04 0140 14    this was life. Occasionally, for no reason that I could
G04 0150 10    see, they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot.
G04 0160  7    Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall
G04 0170  4    had changed direction. Sometimes it was to skirt a
G04 0180  2    gulley. Their gait is impossible to convey in words.
G04 0180 11    It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner
G04 0190  9    about it, it is not a lope, it is not done with style
G04 0200  7    or verve. It is the gait of the human who must run
G04 0210  3    to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the
G04 0210 12    ground, head hung down and only occasionally swinging
G04 0220  8    up to see the target, a loose motion that is just short
G04 0230  8    of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful. It is
G04 0240  4    a barely controlled skimming of the ground.
G04 0250  1       They ran for three hours. Finally, avoiding hummocks
G04 0250  9    and seeking low ground, they intercepted the rain squall.
G04 0260  7    For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall, raising
G04 0270  5    their arms and, for the first time, shouting and capering.
G04 0280  3    Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.
G04 0290  1    They were studying the ground. Suddenly one of them
G04 0290 10    shouted, ran a few feet, bent forward and put his mouth
G04 0300  9    to the ground. He had found a depression with rain
G04 0310  5    water in it. He bent down, a black cranelike figure,
G04 0320  1    and put his mouth to the ground.
G04 0320  8       With a lordly and generous gesture, the discoverer
G04 0330  3    stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.
G04 0330 13    The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.
G04 0340 10    In an instant he had sucked it dry.
G04 0350  6       The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have
G04 0360  3    ever seen. Which does not mean that it is ugly. Part
G04 0360 14    of it is, of course. There are thousands of square
G04 0370  9    miles of salt pan which are hideous. They are huge
G04 0380  6    areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries
G04 0390  3    that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges
G04 0400  1    fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them
G04 0400 10    thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves
G04 0410  9    is a scuttling layer of sand. Such stretches have an
G04 0420  5    inhuman moonlike quality. But much of the land which
G04 0430  2    the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable.
G04 0440  1    It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has
G04 0440 11    a peaceful quality, the hills roll softly.
G04 0450  5       The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully
G04 0460  4    described by the Australian Charles Bean. He tells
G04 0470  2    of three men who started out on a trip across a single
G04 0470 14    paddock, a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep
G04 0480 11    grazer. They went well-equipped with everything except
G04 0490  4    knowledge of the "outback" country. "
G04 0500  1       The countryside looked like a beautiful open park
G04 0500  9    with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps. Nothing
G04 0510  8    appalling or horrible rushed upon these men. Only there
G04 0520  6    happened- nothing. There might have been a pool of
G04 0530  5    cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only- there
G04 0540  4    was not. It might have rained, any time; only- it did
G04 0540 15    not. There might have been a fence or a house just
G04 0550 11    over the next rise; only- there was not. They lay,
G04 0560  6    with the birds hopping from branch to branch above
G04 0570  4    them and the bright sky peeping down at them. No one
G04 0580  1    came".
G04 0580  2       The white men died. And countless others like them
G04 0580 11    have died. Even today range riders will come upon mummified
G04 0590 10    bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult
G04 0600  7    than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction,
G04 0610  3    were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant
G04 0620  1    and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally
G04 0620 10    died.
G04 0630  1       The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the
G04 0630 10    land is hard and pitiless. He knows that the economy
G04 0640  8    of life in the "outback" is awful. There is no room
G04 0650  7    for error or waste. Any organism that falters or misperceives
G04 0660  3    the signals or weakens is done. I do not know if such
G04 0670  3    a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge,
G04 0670 15    but I suspect that it can. Perhaps this is what gives
G04 0680 11    the aborigine his odd air of dignity.
G04 0690  5    #THE FAMILY AT THE BOULDER#
G04 0690 10    SEEING an aborigine today is a difficult thing. Many
G04 0700  7    of them have drifted into the cities and towns and
G04 0710  5    seaports. Others are confined to vast reservations,
G04 0720  1    and not only does the Australian government justifiably
G04 0720  9    not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but
G04 0730 11    on their reservations they are extremely fugitive,
G04 0740  4    shunning camps, coming together only for corroborees
G04 0750  1    at which their strange culture comes to its highest
G04 0750 10    pitch- which is very low indeed.
G04 0760  8       I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived "outback"
G04 0770  5    for years to take me to see some aborigines living
G04 0780  2    in the bush. It was a difficult and ambiguous kind
G04 0780 12    of negotiation, even though the rancher was said to
G04 0790  8    be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their
G04 0800  6    language. Finally, however, the arrangements were made
G04 0810  3    and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover. We
G04 0820  1    followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then
G04 0820 11    swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more
G04 0830  7    than two tire marks on the earth. The rancher went
G04 0840  4    a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big
G04 0850  1    red boulder, swung off the road. At once he started
G04 0850 11    to glance toward the instrument panel. It took me a
G04 0860  8    moment to realize what was odd about that panel: there
G04 0870  5    was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked gently
G04 0880  2    back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about. The
G04 0880 12    rancher was navigating his way across the flatland.
G04 0890  8       "Do you always navigate like this"? I asked.
G04 0900  6       "Damned right", he said. "Once I get out on the
G04 0910  8    flat I do. Some chaps that know an area well can make
G04 0920  5    their way by landmarks ... a tree here, a wash here,
G04 0930  1    a boulder there. But if you don't know the place like
G04 0930 12    the palm of your hand, you'd better use a compass and
G04 0940  9    the speedometer. Two miles northeast, then five miles
G04 0950  5    southwest ... that sort of thing. Very simple".
G04 0960  2       He was right. The landscape kept repeating itself.
G04 0970  1    I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour
G04 0970 13    that it was hopeless. Finally we approached the bivouac
G04 0980  7    of the aborigines. They were camped beside a large
G04 0990  6    column-shaped boulder: a man, his lubra, and two children.
G04 1000  4    The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the
G04 1010  2    small area of shade cast by the boulder.
G04 1020  7       There was also a dog, a dingo dog. Its ribs showed,
G04 1030  7    it was a yellow nondescript color, it suffered from
G04 1040  4    a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in
G04 1050  1    patches. It lay with its head on its paws and only
G04 1050 12    its eyes moving, watching us carefully. It struck me
G04 1060  7    as a very bright and very malnourished dog. No one
G04 1070  4    patted the dog. It was not a pet. It was a worker.
G04 1080  1       "The buggers love shade", the rancher said. "I suppose
G04 1090  1    because it saves them some loss of body water. They'll
G04 1090 11    move around that rock all day, following the shade.
G04 1100  8    During the hottest part of the day, of course, the
G04 1110  6    sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade".
G04 1120  2       We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land
G04 1120 11    Rover, and walked over toward the family.
G04 1130  7       The man was leaning against the rock. He gazed away
G04 1140  6    from us as we approached. He was over six feet tall
G04 1150  4    and very thin. His legs were narrow and very long.
G04 1150 14    Every bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did
G04 1160 11    not give the appearance of starving. He had long black
G04 1170  7    hair and a wispy beard. The ridges over his eyes were
G04 1180  5    huge and his eyelids were half shut. There was something
G04 1190  1    about his face that disturbed me and it took several
G04 1190 11    seconds to realize what. It was not merely that flies
G04 1200 10    were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids
G04 1210  6    did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets.
G04 1220  4    A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into the
G04 1230  2    socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and
G04 1230 12    across the wet surface of the eyeball, and the eye
G04 1240  8    did not blink. The Australian and I both were wearing
G04 1250  6    insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects,
G04 1260  3    but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.
G04 1260 13       I turned to look at the lubra. She remained squatting
G04 1270 11    on her heels all the time we were there; like the man,
G04 1280 10    she was entirely naked. Her long thin arms moved in
G04 1290  7    a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions
G04 1300  2    which were placed in front of her. There were two rubbing
G04 1310  1    sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like
G04 1310 10    knives, a woven-root container which held a few pounds
G04 1320  7    of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent. There
G04 1330  6    was also a long wooden spear and a woomera, a spear-throwing
G04 1340  4    device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and
G04 1350  2    high accuracy. There was also a boomerang, elaborately
G04 1350 10    carved. Everything was burnished with sweat and grease
G04 1360  7    so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved
G04 1370  6    from the same material and to be ageless.
G04 1380  1       The two children, both boys, wandered around the
G04 1380  9    Australian and me for a few moments and then returned
G04 1390 10    to their work. They squatted on their heels with their
G04 1400  6    heads bent far forward, their eyes only a few inches
G04 1410  4    from the ground. They had located the runway of a colony
G04 1420  1    of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the
G04 1420 13    boys picked them up, one at a time, and pinched them
G04 1430  9    dead. The tiny bodies, dropped onto a dry leaf, made
G04 1440  5    a pile as big as a small apple.
G04 1440 13       The odor here was more powerful than that which
G04 1450  8    surrounded the town aborigines. The smell at first
G04 1460  5    was more surprising than unpleasant. It was also subtly
G04 1470  2    familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but
G04 1470 13    multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that
G04 1480  8    the aborigines never bathed. One's impulse is to say
G04 1490  6    that the smell was a stink and unpleasant. But that
G04 1500  3    is a cliche and a dishonest one. The smell is sexual,
G04 1500 14    but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny
G04 1510 10    it.
G04 1510 11       Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat
G04 1520 10    and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second
G04 1530  6    skin. They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and
G04 1540  3    their second skin has a light dusty cast to it. In
G04 1540 14    spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin
G04 1550 10    is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much
G04 1560  5    darker than they appeared; as if the coating of sweat,
G04 1570  3    dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic. The boys had beautiful
G04 1580  1    dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly
G04 1580 10    at the flies and blinked their eyes.
G04 1590  5       "That smell is something, eh, mate"? the Australian
G04 1600  3    asked. "They swear that every person smells different
G04 1610  2    and every family smells different from every other.
G04 1610 10    At the corroborees, when they get to dancing and sweating,
G04 1620  9    you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed
G04 1630  9    to have a specially good smell. Idje, here", and he
G04 1640  6    nodded at the man, "is said to have great odor. The
G04 1650  4    stink is all the same to me, but I really think they
G04 1660  1    can make one another out blindfolded".
G04 1660  7       "Here, Idje, you fella like tabac"? he said sharply.
G04 1670  7    Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon.
G04 1680  4    The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could
G04 1690  3    understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his
G04 1690 12    chest.
