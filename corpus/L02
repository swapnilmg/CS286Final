L02 0010  1       I was giving the parked cars the once-over. The
L02 0010 11    Oldsmobile with the license number JYJ 114 was in
L02 0020  8    stall number five.
L02 0030  1       "Okay", I said to the attendant, "I'll let you know
L02 0030 11    if I close the deal on the office in this building".
L02 0040  9       I walked with him back to the entrance. He gave
L02 0050  8    me a ticket on the agency car and parked it.
L02 0060  3       I was back in ten minutes. "Forgot to get something
L02 0070  1    out of the car", I told him, showing him my ticket.
L02 0070 12       He started to say something as I walked in and then
L02 0080 11    suddenly grinned and said, "Oh, yes. You're the one
L02 0090  7    I was talking to about a monthly rental.
L02 0100  2       "That's right", I told him.
L02 0100  7       He consulted the parking ticket, then looked at
L02 0110  7    a notation and said, "You're in the third row back
L02 0120  6    toward the rear. Can you find it all right"?
L02 0130  1       "Sure", I told him.
L02 0130  5       I went back to the agency car and got out an electric
L02 0140  7    bug, one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing.
L02 0150  2    I always keep a set in the car.
L02 0150 10       I put in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have
L02 0160  9    plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the
L02 0170  6    regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully.
L02 0180  3       I waited until the parking attendant was busy with
L02 0190  2    a customer, then slipped around the back of the car
L02 0190 12    with license number JYM 114, attached the electronic
L02 0200  7    bug to the rear bumper and walked out.
L02 0210  4       The attendant waved me on.
L02 0210  9       One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging
L02 0220  8    around on a city street, trying to make himself inconspicuous,
L02 0230  5    keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building
L02 0240  4    and waiting.
L02 0240  6       For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible
L02 0250  4    to be more or less interested in window displays, then
L02 0260  2    in people passing by. After a while, however, a person's
L02 0270  1    mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable
L02 0270 12    physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment.
L02 0280 10    You want to sit down. Your leg muscles and back muscles
L02 0290  7    feel weary. You're conscious of the fact that your
L02 0300  6    feet hurt, that the city pavements are hard.
L02 0310  1       I waited a solid two hours before my man came out
L02 0310 12    of the office building. He came out alone.
L02 0320  6       I wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking
L02 0330  5    lot and hurried over to his car.
L02 0330 12       The attendant recognized me once more and said,
L02 0340  7    "What did you do about that office"?
L02 0350  2       "I haven't made up my mind yet", I said. "It's a
L02 0360  3    sublease. I have a couple of them I'm figuring on;
L02 0370  1    one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's
L02 0370 12    usually curb parking".
L02 0380  2       "That curb parking is undependable and annoying,
L02 0390  1    particularly when it rains", he said.
L02 0390  7       I kept trying to get him to take my money. "Okay",
L02 0400  8    I told him. "I'm in a rush right now. I know where
L02 0410  6    the car is. Want me to drive it out"?
L02 0420  1       "I'll have one of the boys get it", he said. "It's
L02 0430  1    one of the rules on transients. Regulars drive out
L02 0440  9    their own cars".
L02 0450  1       "Make it as snappy as you can, will you"? I asked.
L02 0460  1       "Oh, that's all right", he said. "You're going to
L02 0460  9    be a regular. You'll get in the office building here.
L02 0470  8    You don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks.
L02 0480  9    You get business where the business is, not where it
L02 0490  5    isn't".
L02 0490  6       I grinned at him, handed him a couple of dollars
L02 0500  5    and said, "By the time you get the parking charge figured
L02 0510  2    up, there should be a cigar in it for you".
L02 0510 12       I hurried over to the agency heap, jumped in, started
L02 0520  9    the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted
L02 0530  9    to shadow turn to the left.
L02 0540  1       I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn.
L02 0540 12    By the time I'd made it he was gone. Traffic was pretty
L02 0550  9    heavy.
L02 0550 10       I turned on the electric bug, and the signal came
L02 0560  7    in loud and clear.
L02 0560 11       I made time and picked him up within ten blocks.
L02 0570  9    I stayed half a block behind him, letting lots of cars
L02 0580  6    keep in between us, listening to the steady beep ...
L02 0590  3    beep ... beep.
L02 0590  6       After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned
L02 0600  3    to the left. I couldn't see him, but the electric bugging
L02 0610  1    device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead,
L02 0610 10    short half beeps when the car I was following was to
L02 0620 10    the left, and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to
L02 0630  6    the right. If it ever got behind me, the beep turned
L02 0640  2    to a buzz.
L02 0640  5       I turned left too soon and got a signal showing
L02 0650  1    that I was still behind him but he was to the right.
L02 0650 13    After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he
L02 0660 11    was behind me. That meant he'd parked someplace. I
L02 0670  5    made a big circle until I located the car parked at
L02 0680  4    the curb in front of an apartment house.
L02 0680 12       I found a parking place half a block away, sat in
L02 0690 10    the car and waited.
L02 0700  1       My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours.
L02 0700 11    Then he came out and started driving toward the beach.
L02 0710  7       By this time it was dark. I could get up close to
L02 0720  7    him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind
L02 0730  3    when there wasn't traffic. My lights would have been
L02 0730 12    a giveaway if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional
L02 0740 11    manner. Moreover, I'd have lost him if it hadn't been
L02 0750  9    for the electronic shadowing device ... His signal
L02 0760  5    was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden
L02 0770  4    it turned to a buzz. I circled the block and found
L02 0770 15    he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant.
L02 0780 10       I sat where I could watch the exit and realized
L02 0790  8    I was hungry. I sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled
L02 0800  7    steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching
L02 0810  3    the aroma of coffee.
L02 0810  7       My man came out an hour later, drove to the beach,
L02 0820  7    turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim
L02 0830  4    and Tan Motel.
L02 0830  7       It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of
L02 0840  5    electrical display in front. I remembered it was the
L02 0850  1    Peeping Tom place.
L02 0850  4       I waited until my man was coming out of the office
L02 0860  3    with the key to a cabin before I went in to register.
L02 0870  1       The card the man I was shadowing had filled out
L02 0870 11    was still on the counter. I noticed that he was in
L02 0880  8    Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of
L02 0890  5    Oscar L. Palmer and wife, giving a San Francisco address.
L02 0900  2       He had written out the license number of his car
L02 0910  1    but had transposed the last two figures, an old dodge
L02 0910 11    which is still good. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred
L02 0920  9    the motel manager doesn't check the license number
L02 0930  5    on the plates against the license number the tenant
L02 0940  2    writes out. If he does, it's still better than an even
L02 0940 13    chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers,
L02 0950  9    and if he should notice it, the thing can be passed
L02 0960  8    off as an honest mistake.
L02 0970  1       I used the alias of Robert C. Richards, gave the
L02 0970 11    first three letters and the first and last figure of
L02 0980  8    the license number on the agency heap, but a couple
L02 0990  5    of phony numbers in between.
L02 0990 10       I could have written anything. The manager of the
L02 1000  7    motel was a woman who apparently didn't care. She was
L02 1010  5    complying with the law in regard to registrations but
L02 1020  2    she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering
L02 1030  1    the tenants.
L02 1030  3       "You mean you're all alone, Mr. Richards"?
L02 1040  1       "That's right".
L02 1040  3       "Your wife isn't going to join you- later"?
L02 1050  5       "I don't think so".
L02 1060  1       "If you expect her to show up", she said, "you'd
L02 1060 10    better put 'and wife' on there. It's a formality, you
L02 1070  8    know".
L02 1070  9       "Any difference in the rate"? I asked.
L02 1090  7       "Not to you", she said smiling. "It's ten dollars
L02 1100  5    either way. There are ice cubes in a container at the
L02 1110  5    far end and in another by the office. There are three
L02 1120  2    soft-drink vending machines, and if you should be joined
L02 1120 12    by- anybody- try to keep things quiet, if you will.
L02 1130 11    We like to run a nice quiet place".
L02 1140  3       "Thank you", I told her.
L02 1140  8       I took another sidelong glance at the other registration
L02 1150  8    card, then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given
L02 1160  9    me and went down long enough to park the car.
L02 1170  3       The construction was reasonably solid; not like
L02 1180  1    the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel
L02 1180 11    units that have stucco all over the outside but walls
L02 1190  7    that are thin enough so you can hear every movement
L02 1200  3    of the people in the adjoining apartment.
L02 1200 10       I put a small electric amplifier against the wall
L02 1210  9    on the side I wanted to case. With the aid of that
L02 1220  8    I could hear my man moving around, heard him cough
L02 1230  3    a couple of times, heard the toilet flush, heard the
L02 1230 13    sound of water running.
L02 1240  4       Whoever his companion was going to be, she was going
L02 1250  3    to join him later. She knew where to come. He didn't
L02 1250 14    have to telephone.
L02 1260  3       I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication
L02 1270  2    had been severed. It's one thing to go without food
L02 1280  1    when you're occupied with some work or when you're
L02 1280 10    simply postponing a meal, but when you're dependent
L02 1290  7    on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's
L02 1300  5    bedded down for the night, hunger can be a gnawing
L02 1310  4    torture.
L02 1310  5       I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter
L02 1320  2    of a mile. The batteries on the bugging device I had
L02 1320 13    put on the car were still fresh enough to send out
L02 1330 10    good strong signals. The powerful microphone I could
L02 1340  5    press against the wall between my motel unit and that
L02 1350  4    occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any
L02 1350 15    conversation, and I was positively nauseated I was
L02 1360  8    so hungry.
L02 1360 10       I got in the car, drove down to the drive-in and
L02 1370 12    ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included,
L02 1380  4    a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible.
L02 1390  2       The place wasn't particularly busy at that time
L02 1400  1    of night, and the girl who was waiting on me, who was
L02 1400 13    clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had
L02 1410  8    ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything
L02 1420  4    there was- and there was lots of it- wanted to be sociable.
L02 1430  4       "You really in a hurry, Handsome"? she asked.
L02 1440  3       "I'm in a hurry, Beautiful".
L02 1440  8       "It's early in the evening to be in a hurry. There's
L02 1450 11    lots of time left". "There may not be any women left",
L02 1460  8    I said.
L02 1460 10       She gave a little pout and said, "I don't get off
L02 1470 10    work until eleven o'clock. That's when my evening commences".
L02 1480  7       "I'll be here at ten-fifty-five", I said.
L02 1490  9       "Oh, you!" she announced. "That's what they all
L02 1500  6    say. What's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your
L02 1510  6    car"?
L02 1510  7       I said "Darn it, that's the automatic signal that
L02 1520  5    shows when the ignition key is on. I didn't turn it
L02 1530  3    off". I reached over and switched off the electronic
L02 1530 12    bugging device.
L02 1540  2       She went in to get the hamburgers, and I switched
L02 1550  1    on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's
L02 1550 11    car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting
L02 1560 10    back with the hamburgers. Then I shut off the device
L02 1570  7    again.
L02 1570  8       She wanted to hang around while I was eating. "Don't
L02 1580  6    you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go
L02 1590  5    to pick her up"?
L02 1590  9       "No", I said. "It's a kindness to her. You see,
L02 1600  8    she's on a diet. She'll eat just a pineapple and cottage
L02 1610  7    cheese salad and I'm to have one with her so she won't
L02 1620  6    feel out of place".
L02 1620 10       "diets can be terrible", the girl said. "How much
L02 1630  7    overweight is she"?
L02 1640  1       "Not a bit", I said, "but she's keeping her figure
L02 1640 11    in hand".
L02 1650  1       She looked at me provocatively. "Good figures should
L02 1660  1    be kept in hand", she said, and walked away with an
L02 1660 12    exaggerated wiggle.
L02 1670  2       I turned on the device again, half fearful that
L02 1670 11    I might find silence, but the buzzes came in loud and
L02 1680 10    clear.
L02 1680 11       When I switched on the lights for her to come and
L02 1690 10    get the check, I had the exact change plus a dollar
L02 1700  6    tip.
