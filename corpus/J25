J25 0010  1    _SENTIMENT:_
J25 0010  2       Tension management and communication of sentiment
J25 0020  1    are the processes involved in the functioning of the
J25 0020 10    element of sentiment or feeling. One of the devices
J25 0030  7    for tension management is preferential mating. The
J25 0040  3    preferential mating of this particular population has
J25 0050  2    been analyzed in a separate study. The relative geographical
J25 0050 11    isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a
J25 0060  8    limited choice in mating. It would seem necessary that
J25 0080  6    members of this population provide support for one
J25 0090  3    another since it is not provided by the larger society.
J25 0090 13    The supportive relations can apparently be achieved
J25 0100  7    in geographical and social isolation. The newlyweds
J25 0110  5    building homes on the same land with either set of
J25 0120  4    parents, and the almost exclusive use of members of
J25 0120 13    the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings
J25 0130  8    illustrate this supportive relationship. As Loomis
J25 0140  4    remarks, "In the internal pattern the chief reason
J25 0150  4    for interacting is to communicate liking, friendship,
J25 0160  1    and love among those who stand in supporting relations
J25 0160 10    to one another and corresponding negative sentiments
J25 0170  5    to those who stand in antagonistic relations".
J25 0180  2    _ACHIEVING:_
J25 0180  3       Maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the
J25 0190  7    appropriate goal or objective of this population today.
J25 0200  2    Yet, the object of the element of achieving through
J25 0200 11    the process of goal attaining for this population appears
J25 0210  9    to have been changed by circumstances brought about
J25 0220  5    by the war. Prior to World War II there was a higher
J25 0230  6    percentage of endogamous marriages than after World
J25 0240  2    war II.
J25 0240  4    _NORMS:_
J25 0240  5       The norms, as elements, refer to "all criteria for
J25 0250  5    judging the character or conduct of both individual
J25 0260  1    and group actions in any social system". The process
J25 0260 10    of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative
J25 0270  6    priorities or values to elements. The elements and
J25 0280  4    processes become evident in a study of mate selection
J25 0290  2    in this population. From the evidence "it may be conjectured
J25 0300  1    that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for
J25 0300 10    core males and females; core-marginal marriages still
J25 0310  6    belong in the category of permissive unions; and core-Negro
J25 0320  6    marriages are proscribed for core members".
J25 0330  2    _STATUS-ROLES:_
J25 0330  4       The element of status-roles and associated processes
J25 0340  2    have not been sufficiently investigated for this population
J25 0350  1    to permit any type of conjectures about them.
J25 0350  9    _POWER:_
J25 0360  1       There is some indication from a limited number of
J25 0360 10    interviews with members of the population that the
J25 0370  6    element of power, primarily the voluntary influence
J25 0380  2    of non-authoritative power, has been exerted on actors
J25 0380 11    in the system, particularly in regard to mate selection.
J25 0390  9    This would seem to vary from family to family, depending
J25 0400  8    somewhat on the core or marginal "status" of that family.
J25 0410  5    Again, size of the group may have some influence on
J25 0420  4    the strength of group controls.
J25 0420  9    _RANKING:_
J25 0420 10       Interviews with members of the Brandywine population
J25 0430  7    were attempted in order to discover the ranking of
J25 0440  6    the various families in the population. The large majority
J25 0450  4    of the interviewees placed core families in the upper
J25 0460  2    positions. Loomis considers ranking a product of the
J25 0460 10    evaluation process. "The standing or rank of an actor
J25 0470  9    in a given social system is determined by the evaluation
J25 0480  6    placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with
J25 0490  3    the norms and standards of the system". Despite the
J25 0500  1    increasing rate of exogamous marriages, the population
J25 0500  8    has been able to sustain, at least to some degree,
J25 0510  8    the consciousness of its intermediate status in society.
J25 0520  4    To some extent the system can be considered a Gemeinschaft
J25 0530  3    in which "social-role occupancies are determined by
J25 0540  2    birth, by attributes such as sex or caste, which are
J25 0540 12    biologically or socially immutable". The adherence
J25 0550  6    of many in the population to the Indian background
J25 0560  4    in their pedigree, and emphasis upon the fact that
J25 0570  2    their ancestors had never been slaves, becomes of prime
J25 0570 11    interest in determining how far these elements promote
J25 0590  7    the self-image of the intermediate status of the group
J25 0600  5    in society.
J25 0600  7    _SANCTIONS:_
J25 0600  8       The negative sanctions applied to core-Negro marriages
J25 0610  7    for core members act as indicators of expected adherence
J25 0620  5    to group norms. However, because of Church laws, lately
J25 0630  4    more stringently enforced, which forbid the marriage
J25 0640  1    of cousins closely related consanguineously, a means
J25 0640  8    of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may
J25 0650  8    be that of recourse to illegitimate unions. A cursory
J25 0660  4    survey of available material indicates a high rate
J25 0670  2    of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have
J25 0670 10    a close consanguineous relationship.
J25 0680  2    #SUBSYSTEMS#
J25 0680  3    The comprehensive or master processes activate all
J25 0690  4    or some of the elements within the social system and
J25 0700  2    subsystems. Within the larger social system are the
J25 0700 10    structural and functional subsystems. The structural
J25 0710  6    subsystem, consisting of relatively stable inter-relationships
J25 0720  5    among its parts, includes:
J25 0730  1    _1._
J25 0730  1       Subgroups of various types, interconnected by relational
J25 0730  8    norms.
J25 0740  1    _2._
J25 0740  2       Roles of various types, within the larger system
J25 0740 10    and within the subgroups ...
J25 0750  4    _3._
J25 0750  5       Regulative norms governing subgroups and roles.
J25 0760  2    _4._
J25 0760  3       Cultural values.
J25 0760  5       In the study of marriage patterns for this group,
J25 0770  5    consanguinity produces the structural system- a system
J25 0780  5    of affinities- which, in turn, maintains the system
J25 0780 13    of consanguinity. Subgroups of various types have been
J25 0790  8    found within this system. Each family line can be considered
J25 0800  8    a substructure. There seems to be an implied cultural
J25 0810  6    value attached to the fact of core status within the
J25 0820  3    group. Additionally, the proscription of core-Negro
J25 0820 10    marriages for core families, discussed above, would
J25 0830  7    seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups
J25 0840  4    and roles. The scope of this study does not provide
J25 0850  3    for the study of roles of various types within the
J25 0850 13    larger system or within the subgroups. However, it
J25 0860  8    cannot be presumed, informal though the structure of
J25 0870  5    the population seems, that there are not well-defined
J25 0880  3    roles within the system.
J25 0880  7       The present study relates to the theory of functional
J25 0890  6    systems. It is hypothesized that fertility is a function
J25 0900  4    of the social system when the population as a whole
J25 0910  1    is considered and a function of the subsystems when
J25 0910 10    the two-fold division of core families and marginal
J25 0920  6    families is considered. The four functional problems
J25 0930  3    of a social system are, to some extent, solved by the
J25 0940  2    subsystems within this population. By means of geographical
J25 0940 10    isolation and high fertility rates, inbreeding can
J25 0950  7    be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater
J25 0960  6    society maintained. In order to attain the goal of
J25 0970  4    group solidarity and to relieve tension, the high fertility
J25 0980  1    rate provides more group members for mate selection,
J25 0980  9    and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance
J25 0990  7    of group controls. To maintain their intermediate position
J25 1000  5    in the larger society, it is not only necessary that
J25 1010  4    members of this population be "visible", but that their
J25 1020  3    numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate,
J25 1020 13    distinct grouping or system in society. As mentioned
J25 1030  8    above, where families are concentrated in larger numbers,
J25 1040  6    group controls seem strongest and most effective. Adaptation
J25 1050  4    to the social and non-social environment through the
J25 1060  3    economy has been met to a degree through a type of
J25 1060 14    occupational segregation. This provides the necessary
J25 1070  6    contact with the larger society, while supporting a
J25 1080  5    type of control over members in terms of social contacts.
J25 1090  4       Integration "has to do with the inter-relation of
J25 1100  2    parts". The problem of solidarity and morale again
J25 1100 10    involves the concept of values. The values placed by
J25 1110  9    the Brandywine population, upon maintaining a certain
J25 1120  5    homogeneity, a certain separate racial identity, and
J25 1130  3    therefore a certain separate social status, are important
J25 1140  1    for the morale of the system. Since morale is closely
J25 1140 11    related to pattern maintenance and integration, the
J25 1150  6    higher the morale and solidarity, the better the system
J25 1160  5    can solve the problems of the system. In this respect
J25 1170  2    it would seem that the greater the social distance
J25 1170 11    between the Brandywine population and the white and
J25 1180  8    Negro populations within the same general locality,
J25 1190  5    the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity
J25 1200  3    within the Brandywine population. It is conceived that
J25 1210  2    one of the means to attain this social distance is
J25 1210 12    that of physical and social isolation. In turn, higher
J25 1220  7    fertility rates for this population provide a means
J25 1230  4    of increasing the numerical quantity of the population,
J25 1240  2    allowing for the possibility of greater stability and
J25 1240 10    unity. The population can thereby replenish itself
J25 1250  7    and actually grow larger.
J25 1260  1    #MASTER PROCESSES#
J25 1260  3    Of particular utility in the analysis of the development,
J25 1270  2    persistence, and change of social systems has been
J25 1270 10    the use of the master or comprehensive processes. Loomis
J25 1280  9    considers six such processes in his paradigm.
J25 1290  5       1. Communication
J25 1290  7       2. Boundary maintenance
J25 1300  2       3. Systemic linkage
J25 1300  5       4. Socialization
J25 1310  1       5. Social control
J25 1310  4       6. Institutionalization Though undoubtedly all six
J25 1320  3    processes are operative within the whole social system
J25 1330  1    and its subsystems, two processes that are of crucial
J25 1330 10    importance to this study will be singled out for particular
J25 1340  9    emphasis:
J25 1350  1    _COMMUNICATION:_
J25 1350  1       In discussing the process of communication, Loomis
J25 1350  8    defines it as "the process by which information, decisions,
J25 1360  9    and directives are transmitted among actors and the
J25 1370  7    ways in which knowledge, opinions, and attitudes are
J25 1380  4    formed, or modified by interaction". Communication
J25 1390  1    may be facilitated by means of the high visibility
J25 1390 10    within the larger community. Intense interaction is
J25 1400  5    easier where segregated living and occupational segregation
J25 1410  3    mark off a group from the rest of the community, as
J25 1420  2    in the case of this population. However, the factor
J25 1420 11    of physical isolation is not a static situation. Although
J25 1430  8    the Brandywine population is still predominantly rural,
J25 1440  5    "there are indications of a consistent and a statistically
J25 1450  4    significant trend away from the older and relatively
J25 1460  2    isolated rural communities ... urbanization appears
J25 1460  8    to be an important factor in the disintegration of
J25 1470  8    this group. This conclusion is, however, an over-simplification.
J25 1480  6    A more realistic analysis must take into account the
J25 1490  5    fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe area
J25 1500  2    are, in general, less segregated locally than group
J25 1500 10    members in rural areas. In the urban area, in other
J25 1510 10    words, they, unlike some urban ethnic groups, do not
J25 1520  6    concentrate in ghetto colonies. Group pressures toward
J25 1530  2    conformity are slight or non-existent, and deviant
J25 1530 10    behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social
J25 1540  9    sanctions. In such a setting social contacts and associations
J25 1550  5    are likely to be heterogamous, resulting in a change
J25 1560  5    of values and almost necessarily, in mate selection
J25 1570  1    behavior. To the extent that urban life contributes
J25 1570  9    to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential
J25 1580  7    isolation, to that extent it contributes directly to
J25 1590  4    increased exogamy".
J25 1590  6    _SOCIAL CONTROL:_
J25 1600  1       The process of social control is operative insofar
J25 1600  8    as sanctions play a part in the individual's behavior,
J25 1610  7    as well as the group's behavior. By means of this social
J25 1620  6    control, deviance is either eliminated or somehow made
J25 1630  4    compatible with the function of the social group. Examples
J25 1640  1    from this population indicate that deviance seems to
J25 1640  9    be sanctioned by ostracism from the group.
J25 1650  6    _SOCIALIZATION:_
J25 1650  7       There is an oral tradition among the members of
J25 1660  6    the population in regard to the origin and subsequent
J25 1670  3    separate status of the group in the larger society.
J25 1680  1    Confused and divided though this tradition may be,
J25 1680  9    it is an important part of the social and cultural
J25 1690  7    heritage of the group, and acts as a means of socialization,
J25 1700  4    particularly for members of the rural community. The
J25 1710  2    fact of Indian ancestry and "free" status during the
J25 1710 11    days of slavery, are important distinctions made by
J25 1720  8    members of the group.
J25 1730  1    _BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE:_
J25 1730  3       "Culturally induced social cohesion resulting from
J25 1740  2    common norms and values internalized by members of
J25 1740 10    the group" is operative in the boundary maintenance
J25 1750  7    of the group as well as in the process of socialization.
J25 1760  7    The process of boundary maintenance identifies and
J25 1770  3    preserves the social system or subsystems, and the
J25 1770 11    characteristic interaction is maintained. As the threat
J25 1780  7    of encroachment on the system increases, the "probability
J25 1790  7    of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases".
J25 1800  3       The fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function,
J25 1810  6    though a latent one, of the process of maintaining
J25 1820  1    the boundary. "Increased boundary maintenance may be
J25 1820  8    achieved, for example, by assigning a higher primacy
J25 1830  8    or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external
J25 1840  5    pattern ..." The external pattern or external system
J25 1850  4    can be considered as "group behavior that enables the
J25 1860  2    group to survive in its environment ..." Boundary maintenance
J25 1865  1    for this group would seem to be primarily social, as
J25 1870 10    is the preference for endogamy. It is also expressed
J25 1880  7    in the proscription against deviants in the matter
J25 1890  4    of endogamy, particularly in rural areas. By their
J25 1900  1    pattern of endogamy and exogamy, the core families
J25 1900  9    and the marginal families show distinct limits to the
J25 1910  6    intergroup contact they maintain.
J25 1920  1    _SYSTEMIC LINKAGE:_
J25 1920  3       Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries
J25 1930  1    or limits of the group, systemic linkage is defined
J25 1930 10    "as the process whereby one or more of the elements
J25 1940  9    of at least two social systems is articulated in such
J25 1950  5    a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some
J25 1960  4    occasions may be viewed as a single unit.
