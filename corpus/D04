D04 0010  1    The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal.
D04 0010 13    The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness, the
D04 0020  7    circle its universality. But how can one figure symbolize
D04 0030  6    both?
D04 0030  7       Christianity declares that in the life and death
D04 0040  6    of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur.
D04 0050  2    Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the
D04 0050 11    unique and the universal as clearly, or formulated
D04 0060  8    it as precisely, as Irenaeus. To be the Savior and
D04 0070  6    the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual
D04 0080  2    with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic
D04 0090  1    aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies
D04 0090 12    itself with man's history. Yet this utterly individual
D04 0100  8    historical person must also contain within himself
D04 0110  6    the common history of mankind. His history is his alone,
D04 0120  5    yet each man must recognize his own history in it.
D04 0130  2    His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own
D04 0130 14    death in the crucifixion of Jesus. Each man can identify
D04 0140  8    himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ
D04 0150  7    because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human
D04 0160  4    history and human death, coming as the head of a new
D04 0170  2    humanity. Not a circle, then, nor a straight line,
D04 0170 11    but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus
D04 0180  8    sees it; for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence.
D04 0190  6    As represented by a spiral, history may, in some sense,
D04 0200  4    be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event
D04 0210  1    remains unique. Christ is both unique and universal.
D04 0210  9       The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history
D04 0220  9    of humanity in Adam. As Origen interprets the end of
D04 0230  6    history on the basis of its beginning, so Irenaeus
D04 0240  3    portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story
D04 0240 14    of Christ. "Whence, then, comes the substance of the
D04 0250  9    first man? From God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin
D04 0260  8    earth. For 'God had not rained', says the Scripture,
D04 0270  6    before man was made, 'and there was no man to till
D04 0280  6    the earth'. From this earth, then, while it was still
D04 0290  2    virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning
D04 0290 12    of humanity". Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve
D04 0300  8    merely as private individuals, but as universal human
D04 0310  6    beings, who were and are all of humanity. Adam and
D04 0320  3    Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed
D04 0330  1    perfection, but in the sense that they were capable
D04 0330 10    of development toward perfection. They were, in fact,
D04 0340  7    children. Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for
D04 0350  5    the human soul; therefore there is no need for him,
D04 0360  2    as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself
D04 0360 11    with the fall. Existence is created and willed by God
D04 0370  9    and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion
D04 0380  6    or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history.
D04 0390  3    Historical existence is a created good.
D04 0390  9       The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed
D04 0400  7    in the words: "So God created man in his own image;
D04 0410  8    in the similitude of God he created him". There are
D04 0420  4    some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the
D04 0430  2    image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished,
D04 0430 11    so most notably in the statement: "If the [Holy] Spirit
D04 0440 10    is absent from the soul, such a man is indeed of an
D04 0450 11    animal nature; and, being left carnal, he will be an
D04 0460  7    imperfect being, possessing the image [of God] in his
D04 0470  4    formation, but not receiving the similitude [of God]
D04 0480  1    through the Spirit". Thus the image of God is that
D04 0480 11    which makes a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude
D04 0490 11    of God, by contrast, is that which makes a man a child
D04 0500  9    of God and not merely a rational creature. Recent research
D04 0510  3    on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that he does
D04 0520  3    not consistently maintain this distinction. He does
D04 0520 10    not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God
D04 0530 10    and his immortality through the fall; for he was created
D04 0540  7    not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable
D04 0550  4    of immortality as well as of mortality.
D04 0560  1       Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows:
D04 0570  1       "So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur,
D04 0570 11    and become lifted up, as if he had no lord, because
D04 0580  9    of the dominion that had been given to him, and the
D04 0590  6    freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, overstepping
D04 0600  2    his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited
D04 0600 12    arrogance towards God, a law was given him by God,
D04 0610 10    that he might know that he had for lord the lord of
D04 0620  9    all. And He laid down for him certain conditions: so
D04 0630  3    that, if he kept the command of God, then he would
D04 0640  1    always remain as he was, that is, immortal; but if
D04 0640 11    he did not, he would become mortal, melting into earth,
D04 0650  7    whence his frame had been taken". These conditions
D04 0660  3    man did not keep, and thus he became mortal; yet he
D04 0670  3    did not stop being human as a result. There is no justification
D04 0680  1    for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus
D04 0680  8    about the image of God beyond this, nor for reading
D04 0690  8    into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction
D04 0700  4    between the image of God (humanity) and the similitude
D04 0710  3    of God (immortality).
D04 0710  6       Man was created with the capacity for immortality,
D04 0720  4    but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange
D04 0730  3    for disobedience cost Adam his immortality. He was,
D04 0730 11    in the words of Irenaeus, "beguiled by another under
D04 0740  8    the pretext of immortality". The true way to immortality
D04 0750  6    lay through obedience, but man did not believe this.
D04 0760  5       "Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when
D04 0770  4    as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed
D04 0780  1    a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin
D04 0780 11    ..., having become disobedient, was made the cause
D04 0790  7    of death, both to herself and to the entire human race;
D04 0800  6    so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [to her],
D04 0810  3    and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience,
D04 0810 11    become the cause of salvation, both to herself and
D04 0820  9    the whole human race". Because he interprets the primitive
D04 0830  6    state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity
D04 0840  4    and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children,
D04 0850  3    Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience
D04 0860  1    as being "due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still
D04 0860 10    wicked". His interpretation of the beginning on the
D04 0870  8    basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels
D04 0880  6    between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary. That parallelism
D04 0890  4    affects his picture of man's disobedience too; for
D04 0900  2    as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue
D04 0900 14    man, so it was disobedience to the word of God in the
D04 0910 12    beginning that brought death into the world, and all
D04 0920  7    our woe.
D04 0920  9       With this act of disobedience, and not with the
D04 0930  5    inception of his individual existence, man began the
D04 0940  3    downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending
D04 0940 11    from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable
D04 0950  9    mortality. At the nadir of that circuit is death. "Along
D04 0960  9    with the fruit they did also fall under the power of
D04 0970  7    death, because they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience
D04 0980  3    to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became forfeit
D04 0990  2    to death, from that [moment] they were handed over
D04 0990 11    to it". This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling
D04 1000  8    notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that
D04 1010  9    they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel
D04 1020  4    to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees a parallel
D04 1030  3    also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.
D04 1030 13    In any case, though they had been promised immortality
D04 1040  9    if they ate of the tree, they obtained mortality instead.
D04 1050  7    The wages of sin is death. Man's life, originally shaped
D04 1060  5    for immortality and for communion with God, must now
D04 1070  4    be conformed to the shape of death.
D04 1070 11       Nevertheless, even at the nadir of the circuit the
D04 1080  9    spiral of history belongs to God, and he still rules.
D04 1090  7    Even death, therefore, has a providential as well as
D04 1100  4    a punitive function.
D04 1100  7       "Wherefore also He [God] drove him [man] out of
D04 1110  6    Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life,
D04 1120  3    not because He envied him the tree of life, as some
D04 1120 14    venture to assert, but because He pitied him, [and
D04 1130  9    did not desire] that he should continue a sinner for
D04 1140  7    ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should
D04 1150  3    be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable.
D04 1150 10    But He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing
D04 1160 12    death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end
D04 1170  8    to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should
D04 1180  4    take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length
D04 1190  2    to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God".
D04 1190 14    This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian,
D04 1200  9    fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology;
D04 1210  7    for it prepares the way for the passage from life through
D04 1220  6    death to life that is achieved in Christ. As man can
D04 1230  4    live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that
D04 1240  1    Christ could bring many to life.
D04 1240  7       It is probably fair to say that the idea of death
D04 1250  6    is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is.
D04 1260  3    This applies to his picture of Adam. It is borne out
D04 1260 14    also by the absence of any developed theory about how
D04 1270 10    sin passes from one generation to the next. It becomes
D04 1280  6    most evident in his description of Christ as the second
D04 1290  5    Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but whose
D04 1300  2    work culminates in the achievement of immortality.
D04 1300  9    This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental
D04 1310  9    problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians,
D04 1320  6    especially the Greek-speaking ones. They speak of the
D04 1330  5    work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility,
D04 1340  1    which can mean (though it does not have to mean) deliverance
D04 1340 12    from time and history.
D04 1350  4       Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds him
D04 1360  2    also of his transience. It represents a punishment
D04 1360 10    that he knows he deserves, but it also symbolizes most
D04 1370  8    dramatically that he lives his life within the process
D04 1380  6    of time. These two aspects of death cannot be successfully
D04 1390  3    separated, but they dare not be confused or identified.
D04 1400  1    The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe
D04 1400  9    death as altogether the consequence of human sin show
D04 1410  8    that these two aspects of death cannot be separated.
D04 1420  5    Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled
D04 1430  2    to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing
D04 1430 11    old and then older and then still older, in short,
D04 1440  9    whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the
D04 1450  7    process of time. If it was, then it must have been
D04 1460  3    God's intention to translate him at a certain point
D04 1460 12    from time to eternity. One night, so some of these
D04 1470 10    theories run, Adam would have fallen asleep, much as
D04 1480  6    he fell asleep for the creation of Eve; and thus he
D04 1490  4    would have been carried over into the life eternal.
D04 1490 13    The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness
D04 1500  8    of death is an illustration of the thesis that death
D04 1510  7    cannot be only a punishment, for some termination seems
D04 1520  4    necessary in a life that is lived within the natural
D04 1530  2    order of time and change.
D04 1530  7       On the other hand, Christian faith knows that death
D04 1540  5    is more than the natural termination of temporal existence.
D04 1550  2    It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law. If
D04 1570  1    this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished
D04 1570 10    from the idea of death as natural termination, the
D04 1580  7    conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence
D04 1590  3    itself is a form of punishment rather than the state
D04 1600  1    into which man is put by the will of the Creator. This
D04 1600 13    seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was
D04 1610  8    forced. If death receives more than its share of attention
D04 1620  7    from the theologian and if sin receives less than its
D04 1630  4    share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ
D04 1640  1    begins to look like the divinely appointed means of
D04 1640 10    rescue from temporal, i.e., created, existence. Such
D04 1650  5    an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian
D04 1660  4    view of creation; for it teaches salvation from, not
D04 1670  3    salvation in, time and history. Because Christianity
D04 1680  1    teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation
D04 1680  9    by the history of Christ, such an interpretation of
D04 1690  6    death would require a drastic revision of the Christian
D04 1700  4    understanding of the work of Christ.
