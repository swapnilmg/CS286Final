G69 0010  1    Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly
G69 0010 10    in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles
G69 0020  7    of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery
G69 0030  5    will necessarily better the human lot. On the other
G69 0040  3    hand, the bright vision of the future has been directly
G69 0040 13    stated in science fiction concerned with projecting
G69 0060  7    ideal societies- science fiction, of course, is related,
G69 0070  6    if sometimes distantly, to that utopian literature
G69 0080  3    optimistic about science, literature whose period of
G69 0090  2    greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
G69 0090 11    centuries produced Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward
G69 0100  6    and H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. In Arthur Clarke's
G69 0110  8    Childhood's End (1953), though written after the present
G69 0120  8    flood of dystopias began, we can see the bright vision
G69 0130  8    of science fiction clearly defined.
G69 0140  2       Childhood's End- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz's
G69 0150  2    utopian romance, Auf Zwei Planeten (1897), and also
G69 0160  2    to Wells's histories of the future, especially The
G69 0160 10    World Set Free (1914) and The Shape of Things to Come
G69 0170 10    (1933)- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by
G69 0190  7    the Overlords, vastly superior creatures who come to
G69 0200  5    our world in order to prepare the human race for its
G69 0210  2    next stage of development, an eventual merging with
G69 0210 10    the composite mind of the universe. Arriving just in
G69 0220  8    time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive
G69 0230  6    wasteland, the Overlords unite earth into one world
G69 0240  4    in which justice, order, and benevolence prevail and
G69 0250  1    ignorance, poverty, and fear have ceased to exist.
G69 0250  9    Under their rule, earth becomes a technological utopia.
G69 0260  6    Both abolition of war and new techniques of production,
G69 0270  4    particularly robot factories, greatly increase the
G69 0280  2    world's wealth, a situation described in the following
G69 0280 10    passage, which has the true utopian ring: "Everything
G69 0290  8    was so cheap that the necessities of life were free,
G69 0300  7    provided as a public service by the community, as roads,
G69 0310  5    water, street lighting and drainage had once been.
G69 0320  2    A man could travel anywhere he pleased, eat whatever
G69 0320 11    he fancied- without handing over any money". With destructive
G69 0330 10    tensions and pressures removed men have the vigor and
G69 0340  8    energy to construct a new human life- rebuilding entire
G69 0350  3    cities, expanding facilities for entertainment, providing
G69 0360  2    unlimited opportunities for education- indeed, for
G69 0370  1    the first time giving everyone the chance to employ
G69 0370 10    his talents to the fullest. Mankind, as a result, attains
G69 0380  7    previously undreamed of levels of civilization and
G69 0390  4    culture, a golden age which the Overlords, a very evident
G69 0400  2    symbol of science, have helped produce by introducing
G69 0400 10    reason and the scientific method into human activities.
G69 0410  8    Thus science is the savior of mankind, and in this
G69 0420  7    respect Childhood's End only blueprints in greater
G69 0430  4    detail the vision of the future which, though not always
G69 0435  2    so directly stated, has nevertheless been present in
G69 0440  6    the minds of most science-fiction writers.
G69 0450  6       Considering then the optimism which has permeated
G69 0460  4    science fiction for so long, what is really remarkable
G69 0470  1    is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction
G69 0470 11    writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished
G69 0480  9    vision of the future, have attacked the Childhood's
G69 0490  5    End kind of faith that science and technology will
G69 0500  4    inevitably better the human condition. And they have
G69 0510  2    done this on a very large scale, with a veritable flood
G69 0510 13    of novels and stories which are either dystopias or
G69 0520  8    narratives of adventure with dystopian elements. Because
G69 0530  5    of the means of publication- science-fiction magazines
G69 0540  2    and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science
G69 0550  1    fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range
G69 0550 10    and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known,
G69 0560  8    though one fact is evident: the science-fiction imagination
G69 0570  5    has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations. Among
G69 0580  2    the dystopias, for example, Isaac Asimov's The Caves
G69 0590  2    of Steel (1954) portrays the deadly effects on human
G69 0590 11    life of the super-city of the future; James Blish's
G69 0600 10    A Case of Conscience (1958) describes a world hiding
G69 0610  6    from its own weapons of destruction in underground
G69 0620  3    shelters; Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1954) presents
G69 0630  4    a book-burning society in which wall television and
G69 0640  2    hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; Walter M. Miller,
G69 0650  1    Jr.'s, A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959) finds men, after
G69 0660  1    the great atomic disaster, stumbling back to their
G69 0660  9    previous level of civilization and another catastrophe;
G69 0670  5    Frederick Pohl's "The Midas Touch" (1954) predicts
G69 0680  4    an economy of abundance which, in order to remain prosperous,
G69 0690  4    must set its robots to consuming surplus production;
G69 0700  1    Clifford D. Simak's "How-2" (1954) tells of a future
G69 0710  1    when robots have taken over, leaving men nothing to
G69 0710 10    do; and Robert Sheckley's The Status Civilization (1960)
G69 0720  6    describes a world which, frightened by the powers of
G69 0730  7    destruction science has given it, becomes static and
G69 0740  4    conformist. A more complete list would also include
G69 0750  1    Bradbury's "The Pedestrian" (1951), Philip K. Dick's
G69 0760  1    Solar Lottery (1955), David Karp's One (1953), Wilson
G69 0770  1    Tucker's The Long Loud Silence (1952), Jack Vance's
G69 0780  1    To Live Forever (1956), Gore Vidal's Messiah (1954),
G69 0790  6    and Bernard Wolfe's Limbo (1952), as well as the three
G69 0800 10    perhaps most outstanding dystopias, Frederik Pohl and
G69 0810  6    C. M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants (1953), Kurt
G69 0820  6    Vonnegut's Player Piano (1952), and John Wyndham's
G69 0830  6    Re-Birth (1953), works which we will later examine
G69 0840  5    in detail. The novels and stories like Pohl's Drunkard's
G69 0850  2    Walk (1960), with the focus on adventure and with the
G69 0860  3    dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case
G69 0860 12    an uneasy, overpopulated world in which the mass of
G69 0870  9    people do uninteresting routine jobs while a carefully
G69 0880  6    selected, university-trained elite runs everything-
G69 0890  3    are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias.
G69 0900  1       There is, of course, nothing new about dystopias,
G69 0900  9    for they belong to a literary tradition which, including
G69 0910  7    also the closely related satiric utopias, stretches
G69 0920  3    from at least as far back as the eighteenth century
G69 0930  1    and Swift's Gulliver's Travels to the twentieth century
G69 0940  1    and Zamiatin's We, Capek's War with the Newts, Huxley's
G69 0950  1    Brave New World, E. M. Forster's "The Machine Stops",
G69 0960  2    C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength, and Orwell's Nineteen
G69 0970  4    Eighty-Four, and which in science fiction is represented
G69 0980  1    before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy,
G69 0980 10    The Time Machine, "A Story of the Days to Come", and
G69 0990 11    When the Sleeper Wakes, and as recently as Jack Williamson's
G69 1000 10    "With Folded Hands" (1947), the classic story of men
G69 1010  9    replaced by their own robots. What makes the current
G69 1020  7    phenomenon unique is that so many science-fiction writers
G69 1030  5    have reversed a trend and turned to writing works critical
G69 1040  3    of the impact of science and technology on human life.
G69 1050  1    Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared
G69 1050 10    only in the last twelve years, it seems fairly reasonable
G69 1060  8    to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication
G69 1070  6    of Nineteen Eighty-Four, an assumption which is supported
G69 1080  4    by the frequent echoes of such details as Room 101,
G69 1090  3    along with education by conditioning from Brave New
G69 1090 11    World, a book to which science-fiction writers may
G69 1100  9    well have returned with new interest after reading
G69 1110  6    the more powerful Orwell dystopia.
G69 1120  1       Not all recent science fiction, however, is dystopian,
G69 1120  9    for the optimistic strain is still very much alive
G69 1130  8    in Mission of Gravity and Childhood's End, as we have
G69 1140  7    seen, as well as in many other recent popular novels
G69 1150  4    and stories like Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud (1957);
G69 1160  3    and among works of dystopian science fiction, not all
G69 1170  2    provide intelligent criticism and very few have much
G69 1170 10    merit as literature- but then real quality has always
G69 1180  9    been scarce in science fiction. In addition, there
G69 1190  4    are many areas of the human situation besides the impact
G69 1200  3    of science and technology which are examined, for science-fiction
G69 1210  1    dystopias often extrapolate political, social, economic
G69 1210  7    tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology.
G69 1220  8    Nevertheless, with all these qualifications and exceptions,
G69 1230  7    the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive
G69 1240  4    for its criticism that science and technology, instead
G69 1250  2    of bringing utopia, may well enslave, dehumanize, and
G69 1250 10    even destroy men. How effectively these warnings can
G69 1260  8    be presented is seen in Pohl and Kornbluth's The Space
G69 1270  7    Merchants, Vonnegut's Player Piano and Wyndham's Re-Birth.
G69 1280  7       Easily the best known of these three novels is The
G69 1290 10    Space Merchants, a good example of a science-fiction
G69 1300  7    dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact
G69 1310  4    of science on human life, though its most important
G69 1320  1    warning is in this area, namely as to the use to which
G69 1320 13    discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put.
G69 1330  7    The novel, which is not merely dystopian but also brilliantly
G69 1340  4    satiric, describes a future America where one-sixteenth
G69 1350  3    of the population, the men who run advertising agencies
G69 1360  1    and big corporations, control the rest of the people,
G69 1360 10    the submerged fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers
G69 1370  7    and consumers, with the government being no more than
G69 1380  5    "a clearing house for pressures". Like ours, the economy
G69 1390  4    of the space merchants must constantly expand in order
G69 1400  1    to survive, and, like ours, it is based on the principle
G69 1400 12    of "ever increasing everybody's work and profits in
G69 1410  7    the circle of consumption". The consequences, of course,
G69 1420  5    have been dreadful: reckless expansion has led to overpopulation,
G69 1430  5    pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural
G69 1440  4    resources. For example, even the most successful executive
G69 1450  1    lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people
G69 1450 10    rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in
G69 1460  7    which to sleep at night; soyaburgers have replaced
G69 1470  3    meat, and wood has become so precious that it is saved
G69 1480  2    for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled
G69 1480 11    that no one dares walk in the open without respirators
G69 1490 10    or soot plugs.
G69 1500  1       While The Space Merchants indicates, as Kingsley
G69 1500  8    Amis has correctly observed, some of the "impending
G69 1510  7    consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial
G69 1520  5    power" and satirizes "existing habits in the advertising
G69 1530  4    profession", its warning and analysis penetrate much
G69 1540  2    deeper. What is wrong with advertising is not only
G69 1540 11    that it is an "outrage, an assault on people's mental
G69 1550  8    privacy" or that it is a major cause for a wasteful
G69 1560  8    economy of abundance or that it contains a coercive
G69 1570  3    tendency (which is closer to the point). Rather what
G69 1570 12    Kornbluth and Pohl are really doing is warning against
G69 1580  9    the dangers inherent in perfecting "a science of man
G69 1590  7    and his motives". The Space Merchants, like such humanist
G69 1600  5    documents as Joseph Wood Krutch's The Measure of Man
G69 1610  5    and C. S. Lewis's The Abolition of Man, considers what
G69 1620  5    may result from the scientific study of human nature.
G69 1630  4    If man is actually the product of his environment and
G69 1640  2    if science can discover the laws of human nature and
G69 1640 12    the ways in which environment determines what people
G69 1650  5    do, then someone- a someone probably standing outside
G69 1660  4    traditional systems of values- can turn around and
G69 1670  2    develop completely efficient means for controlling
G69 1670  8    people. Thus we will have a society consisting of the
G69 1680  9    planners or conditioners, and the controlled. And this,
G69 1690  6    of course, is exactly what Madison Avenue has been
G69 1700  3    accused of doing albeit in a primitive way, with its
G69 1700 13    "hidden persuaders" and what the space merchants accomplish
G69 1710  8    with much greater sophistication and precision.
G69 1720  5       Pohl and Kornbluth's ad men have long since thrown
G69 1730  7    out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising
G69 1740  3    which tie in with "every basic trauma and neurosis
G69 1750  1    in American life", which work on the libido of consumers,
G69 1750 11    which are linked to the "great prime motivations of
G69 1760  9    the human spirit". As the hero, Mitchell Courtenay,
G69 1770  6    explains before his conversion, the job of advertising
G69 1780  5    is "to convince people without letting them know that
G69 1790  3    they're being convinced". And to do this requires first
G69 1800  1    of all the kind of information about people which is
G69 1800 11    provided by the scientists in industrial anthropology
G69 1810  5    and consumer research, who, for example, tell Courtenay
G69 1820  4    that three days is the "optimum priming period for
G69 1830  2    a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic
G69 1830 12    cue-phrase"- which means that an effective propaganda
G69 1840  9    technique is to send an idea into circulation and then
G69 1850  7    three days later reinforce or undermine it. And the
G69 1860  4    second requirement for convincing people without their
G69 1870  2    knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and
G69 1870 11    pictures which persuade by using the principles which
G69 1880  7    the scientists have discovered. Thus the copywriter
G69 1890  4    in the world of the space merchants is the person who
G69 1900  3    in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet, the person
G69 1900 14    "capable of putting together words that stir and move
G69 1910  9    and sing". As Courtenay explains, "Here in this profession
G69 1920  7    we reach into the souls of men and women. And we do
G69 1930  8    it by taking talent- and redirecting it".
G69 1940  2       Now the basic question to be asked in this situation
G69 1950  1    is what motivates the manipulators, that is, what are
G69 1950 10    their values?- since, as Courtenay says, "Nobody should
G69 1960  9    play with lives the way we do unless he's motivated
G69 1970  6    by the highest ideals". But the only ideal he can think
G69 1980  5    of is "Sales"! Indeed, again and again, the space merchants
G69 1990  3    confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners
G69 2000  1    and behavioral scientists, once they have seen through
G69 2000  9    human nature, will have nothing except their impulses
G69 2010  8    and desires to guide them.
