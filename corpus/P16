P16 0010  1       Unimpressed, the dog plopped on the sand. Quint
P16 0010  9    couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving. For eleven
P16 0020  6    days they'd done the same thing, leaving the cottage
P16 0030  5    quietly before breakfast, before Esperanza Beach got
P16 0040  3    jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy
P16 0040 12    lifeguards. The swirling sand made Quint's limp more
P16 0050  8    pronounced. They walked slowly past the sherbet-colored
P16 0060  6    cottages- eleven lemon, nine mint, seven orange- around
P16 0070  4    the curve to a deserted stand with an "Eats" sign jiggling
P16 0080  3    in the wind.
P16 0080  6       Now they were in friendly territory. Nobody around.
P16 0090  3    Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly
P16 0100  2    to the water's edge. His rock was to the right of a
P16 0110  1    V-shaped inlet, a big, brown, lumpy rock trailing
P16 0110 10    seaweed whiskers. His rock was special because no one
P16 0120  8    on the beach could see him here. Here he was enclosed
P16 0130  5    and safe. (If a dragon or a sea monster came along,
P16 0140  2    didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt-
P16 0140 13    ten blades and a corkscrew?)
P16 0150  5       Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe.
P16 0160  5    He was Canute controlling the waves. He was a knight
P16 0170  3    of the Round Table, "Sir Quintus the Brave", slaying
P16 0180  1    evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches
P16 0180  9    with warty noses. (One good thing about a suit of armor,
P16 0190  9    his leg wouldn't show.) He was the first astronaut
P16 0200  5    on the moon, chosen because of his small size and intrepid
P16 0210  3    nature. He was six feet one like his father, with big
P16 0220  1    hands and a hairy chest, a man the weak and persecuted
P16 0220 12    would turn to. Fearless. Every night when he wanted
P16 0230  7    a drink of water, didn't he practice being fearless
P16 0240  3    by not turning on the bathroom light? A dark bathroom
P16 0250  2    can be pretty scary, and he'd creep back to bed, proud
P16 0250 13    of himself, thinking: Tomorrow, for sure, I'll go down
P16 0260  9    to the rock and keep my promise to Dad.
P16 0270  7       He hadn't intended to make the promise. It happened
P16 0280  4    two weeks ago, the night before his father left on
P16 0290  2    a business trip to South America. Every piece of the
P16 0290 12    nightmare was clear, in place; and when he woke up,
P16 0300  9    his father was saying, "Stop screaming, Quint. It's
P16 0310  4    all right. Stop shaking".
P16 0320  1       He could remember the feel of his father's big hands,
P16 0320 10    the thump of his father's heart sending out signals-
P16 0330  6    regular, like radar. "Let's talk about the beach. Son.
P16 0340  6    While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig, hear?
P16 0350  6    Look, I can put two fingers between the cords in the
P16 0360  3    back of your neck. Dr. Fortman says swimming would
P16 0360 12    help your leg. He says you're limping more than you
P16 0370  9    need to".
P16 0370 11       "How does he know? Big dumb nut. He never had polio".
P16 0380 11       In the light from the bedside table his father looked
P16 0390 10    so worried that the promise spilled out. "You just
P16 0400  6    wait, Dad. When you get back I'll probly be swimming
P16 0410  4    better than Victoria. Wait and see, Dad".
P16 0420  1       Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint,
P16 0420  8    a head taller, and could lick any boy or girl on the
P16 0430 10    beach. He called her "Fatso". She called him "Stuck-up-
P16 0440  6    that's why nobody plays with you, Mister Stuck-up".
P16 0450  5    Or, what was worse, she prayed for him out loud at
P16 0460  3    bedtime: "Please, Lord Gord, please give my brother
P16 0460 11    the strength to go swimming like he promised".
P16 0470  8       "She's got a nerve". Quint said now to the clouds.
P16 0480 10    Strength began to zip up and down his chest. He felt
P16 0490  8    strong as a giant. He unlaced his high brown shoes
P16 0500  3    and took off the metal brace on his leg. He wadded
P16 0500 14    his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his
P16 0510 11    swimming trunks.
P16 0520  1       "Goolick, goooolick", creaked a sea gull.
P16 0520  7       "Aw, shut up", he said.
P16 0530  4       He stood on the rock, a skinny, dignified boy surrounded
P16 0540  2    by the ocean. The wind bored a hole between his shoulder
P16 0540 13    blades, and when he looked at the choppy waves coming
P16 0550 10    and going and crossing each other he could see his
P16 0560  7    head down there, bleeding, wedged between the rocks
P16 0570  3    and the waves.
P16 0570  6       I can't go in. I'm scared of the nightmare.
P16 0580  4    ##
P16 0580  5    Shivering, he put on his clothes. And shivering with
P16 0590  2    shame, he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and
P16 0590 13    spat into the water.
P16 0600  4       "Watch it, big shot", a hoarse voice yelled back.
P16 0610  2    She was holding on to his rock with one hand. She smelled
P16 0610 14    of peppermints. She wore a bathing suit like his mother's,
P16 0620 10    no straps on the shouders.
P16 0630  4       "Why didn't you duck"? he snapped. "This is my rock".
P16 0640  5       "Isn't".
P16 0640  6       "Is".
P16 0650  1       "Isn't".
P16 0650  2       "Is".
P16 0650  3       She was sore as a boil. "Ever hear of squatter's
P16 0660  4    rights"?
P16 0660  5       "Sure. They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill
P16 0670  6    of eighteen"-
P16 0670  8       "Mister Big Britches, aren't you"?
P16 0680  5       "I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth. They call me
P16 0690  6    Quint".
P16 0690  7       "Then why don't you stop squinting"?
P16 0700  4       "I said Quint. That's short for Quintus. Quintus
P16 0710  3    in Latin means"-
P16 0710  6       "I can speak both kinds of Latin, smart aleck".
P16 0720  6    Her cough sounded like cloth ripping.
P16 0730  1       "You shouldn't smoke so much", he said, unconsciously
P16 0740  1    imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice.
P16 0740  7       "I don't smoke". She was horrified. "Do you"?
P16 0750  7       "Hell, yes". Not having said "hell" before, he stumbled
P16 0760  8    a bit before gathering momentum. "Sometimes eleven,
P16 0770  4    fourteen a day".
P16 0770  7       "If I was your mama, I'd wop your tail off".
P16 0780  9       "My mother never wops me. I've got this leg brace".
P16 0790  8       She seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to
P16 0800  6    roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace.
P16 0810  3       "Dingy-looking", was what she said. "Why don't you
P16 0820  2    paint it red and white like a barber pole"?
P16 0820 11       "Because maybe I won't have to wear it always. Dr.
P16 0830 10    Fortman says if I exercise my leg more, maybe I can
P16 0840  9    use a cane when I'm big".
P16 0850  1       She spouted a mouthful of water into the air. "A
P16 0850 11    cane's mighty handy. Someone's walking past, you want
P16 0860  7    to stop him, zoooop, snag him around the neck with
P16 0870  7    the crook in your cane. Or say a waiter brings you
P16 0880  3    a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it- all you got to
P16 0890  1    do is bannnnnng, stooooomp your cane on the floor ...
P16 0900  8    Hey, will you look at that"?
P16 0910  5       Maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking
P16 0920  2    the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume
P16 0920 12    of a tail.
P16 0930  1       "That's some dog. What kind"?
P16 0930  6       "Part collie, part wire-haired terrier". Quint glared.
P16 0940  7    He always did when people asked.
P16 0950  2       "Holy mackerel, that's the most unique dog I ever
P16 0960  2    saw", she said firmly.
P16 0960  6       "His real name's DiMaggio, only we call him Maggie
P16 0970  6    because he has to take tranquilizers. He's braver than
P16 0980  3    he looks. He's been sick lately. Last Tuesday he went
P16 0990  2    on a ham jag".
P16 0990  6       "A what"?
P16 0990  8       He would have told her, but Victoria was yodeling.
P16 1000  6    That meant "Mama wants you Quint. Come home or I'll
P16 1010  5    come find you".
P16 1010  8       "I gotta go. Even though this is my rock, you can
P16 1020  9    use it sometimes. I come early in the morning".
P16 1030  4       "So do I. See you around, Mister Squint".
P16 1040  1    ##
P16 1040  2    That was how they started being friends. They met next
P16 1050  1    morning and all the mornings thereafter. Same time,
P16 1050  9    early, before the fog burned off, because she didn't
P16 1060  8    like the sun; it made her blister. Her name was Sabella,
P16 1070  6    and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald
P16 1080  4    necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying
P16 1090  1    love.
P16 1090  2       "You going to marry the King"? "No. He's got a long
P16 1100  4    beard and picks his teeth with a fork. My hair is what
P16 1100 16    he's nuts about. Naturally curly hair runs in my family.
P16 1110 10    Personally, I prefer straight hair like yours, but
P16 1120  8    as they say on the Continent, 'What can one do'"?
P16 1130  1       "Which continent"?
P16 1140  1       "Name one, I been there". Japan, she said, smelled
P16 1140 10    pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches
P16 1150  9    till the fish got hard as rocks; then they scraped
P16 1160  5    off the mold and made fish soup. Pugh. Camels in Tripoli
P16 1170  4    had harelips. Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans
P16 1180  2    down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all
P16 1180 13    night. As for dancing- holy mackerel, he ought to see
P16 1190 10    the gypsies in Jerez; they danced on the sand till
P16 1200  7    your blood got hot and danced with them.
P16 1210  2       "Really". Quint smothered a yawn. She made better
P16 1220  1    pictures than any book he'd read, but he didn't say
P16 1220 11    so. Artfully, as the days went by, he found occasion
P16 1230  9    to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross
P16 1240  5    in the Korean War; that his baby sister could spit
P16 1250  2    up through her nose when she felt like it; that he
P16 1250 13    personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading
P16 1260 10    the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia.
P16 1270  5       "Books are for schnooks". She skipped a piece of
P16 1280  5    water at him and laughed, a funny, hoarse laugh he
P16 1290  1    liked to hear.
P16 1290  4       Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella.
P16 1300  2    ("What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil? Let's
P16 1310  1    get dressed up- the doctor's taking us out tonight".
P16 1310 10    And "What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist?
P16 1320  9    Tooth-hurty".) Encouraged by her giggles he imitated
P16 1330  6    Maggie who was crazy about ham. He described the ham
P16 1340  4    decorated with pineapple and cherries, cooling on the
P16 1350  2    porch. He snuck up on the ham like Maggie, gumming
P16 1350 12    it with soft, stumpy teeth, then panting with thirst,
P16 1360  7    lapping up the water in the lagoon, swelling up like
P16 1370  4    a balloon, staggering home to be sick, while his mother
P16 1380  2    said, "That does it. That dog has to go".
P16 1390  1       "Say, you're quite a comic", Sabella said admiringly.
P16 1390  9    "Ever thought about going on the stage"?
P16 1400  7       He hadn't. But it was such a nice thought that he
P16 1410  8    nodded his head. "Either that or a veterinarian".
P16 1420  3       "Better make up your mind, son", Sabella said. "You
P16 1430  3    can't serve cod and salmon".
P16 1430  8       Sometimes they argued. She said sharks have no bones
P16 1440  8    and shrimp swam backward. His encylopedia agreed with
P16 1450  4    Sabella. Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies
P16 1460  3    with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet
P16 1460 13    to the rock where she was swimming around. Boy, could
P16 1470 10    she catch! Like Willie Mays in the outfield.
P16 1480  6       "Nobody gave me flowers before. Thank you, Quint".
P16 1490  4    Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered
P16 1500  2    cough. "You can always tell a real gentleman- they
P16 1500 11    got a certain je ne say quok".
P16 1510  7       Sometimes they didn't talk at all. He daydreamed
P16 1520  5    on the rock while she swam and splashed around. Once
P16 1530  2    when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered,
P16 1530 13    "Don't feel like it", he was tempted to tell her about
P16 1540 11    being scared. But Victoria began yodeling just then
P16 1550  7    and he went home, carrying Sabella in the back of his
P16 1560  7    head, not thinking about her, just knowing she was
P16 1570  3    there, smiling, smelling of peppermints. As for his
P16 1570 11    promise- oh, he had plenty of time, buckets of time.
P16 1580 12    ##
P16 1580 13    Wednesday morning it happened. They were eating breakfast.
P16 1590  7    "We beseech thee, Lord Gord, to bless this food"- that
P16 1600  7    was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin
P16 1610  5    toast on her plastic bib. Same old breakfast till the
P16 1620  3    phone rang, making his mother's voice shake with excitement.
P16 1630  1       "Your Daddy's in San Francisco", she told them.
P16 1640  2    "He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane. Fifteen
P16 1650  1    days early- isn't that wonderful"?
P16 1650  6       "Yeah, keen". A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's
P16 1660  9    stomach.
P16 1660 10       "Children, we'll have to get organized. The baby
P16 1670  8    can have an early nap. Victoria, I want you to ..."
P16 1680  6       Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't
P16 1700  1    be scared. "Hurry up, we're late", he said, noticing
P16 1710  3    with a chill how gray the sky was this morning, the
P16 1710 14    fog like a rope along the horizon, the choppy waves
P16 1720 10    sending off sheets of blue and Kool-Aid green.
P16 1730  6       The cave in his stomach hurt. He had to go into
P16 1740  5    the water. He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare. It
P16 1750  1    had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung.
P16 1750 13    What caused it, he didn't know. The metal collar gagging
P16 1760  9    his neck? Sweating so much? The unbearable weight on
P16 1770  7    his chest? All of it together meant drowning. The first
P16 1780  5    time the nurse took him out of the lung, she said if
P16 1790  3    he got frightened, she'd put him back for a second.
