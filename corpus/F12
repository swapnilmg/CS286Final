F12 0010  1    From time to time the medium mentions other people
F12 0010 10    "around him", who were "on the other side", and reports
F12 0020  9    what they are saying. After a while there come initials
F12 0030  6    and names, and he is interested to hear some rather
F12 0040  3    unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the
F12 0050  1    sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more
F12 0050 11    personal and specific statements. There are a few prognoses
F12 0060  7    of coming events.
F12 0060 10    ##
F12 0070  1    ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat
F12 0070  9    different content, but in general it would probably
F12 0080  8    sound much like the foregoing reading. Some mediums
F12 0090  4    speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while others
F12 0100  2    may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact,
F12 0100 13    consider themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving
F12 0110  8    messages from the deceased. In fact, some sensitives
F12 0120  7    rule this out, preferring to consider their expression
F12 0130  4    as strictly extra-sensory perception (ESP), on this
F12 0140  3    side of the "veil". However that may be, people are
F12 0150  1    known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps
F12 0150 10    they are mourning a recent death and want comfort,
F12 0160  7    to feel in touch with the deceased, or seek indications
F12 0170  4    for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity
F12 0180  1    seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon
F12 0180 10    of mediumship.
F12 0190  1       The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation
F12 0200  1    is working in this experiment are in a waking or only
F12 0200 12    slightly dissociated state, so that the sitter can
F12 0210  7    make comments, ask and answer questions, instead of
F12 0220  3    talking with a "control" who speaks through an entranced
F12 0230  2    sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like
F12 0230 13    an ordinary conversation.
F12 0240  2       But it is not really only a conversation. Many a
F12 0250  3    sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize
F12 0250 13    that the medium was describing very vividly his state
F12 0260  9    of mind. He himself might not have been really aware
F12 0270  7    of his own mood; it had been latent, unspecified, semi-conscious
F12 0280  4    and only partly realized- until she described it to
F12 0290  4    him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability
F12 0300  1    to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify
F12 0300 12    them.
F12 0310  1       However, in the next visit that the researcher made
F12 0310 10    to the medium, he did not receive a personal reading.
F12 0320  8    Instead he brought with him the names of some people
F12 0330  7    he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing.
F12 0340  3    For this was to be a "proxy sitting".
F12 0340 11    ##
F12 0340 12    AS WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid,
F12 0350 10    objective study of this sort of communication, the
F12 0360  6    interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive.
F12 0370  4    Dr. Karlis Osis, Director of Research at the Parapsychology
F12 0380  3    Foundation, described the basis for the experiment
F12 0390  1    in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After
F12 0400  1    Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly
F12 0400 10    established that in a number of instances the message
F12 0410  9    did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically
F12 0420  6    by the medium from the sitter".
F12 0430  1       The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's
F12 0430 11    ESP may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this,
F12 0440 12    the two central characters in this drama must be separated.
F12 0450  8       One way to do this is by "proxy sittings", wherein
F12 0460  7    the person seeking a message does not himself meet
F12 0470  5    with the medium but is represented by a substitute,
F12 0480  1    the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about
F12 0480 10    the absent sitter except his name (given by the experimenter),
F12 0490  8    he cannot possibly give any clues, conscious or unconscious,
F12 0500  7    far less ask leading questions. All he can do is to
F12 0510  7    be an objective and careful questioner, seeking to
F12 0520  2    help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific
F12 0520 11    her paranormal impressions.
F12 0530  2       Sometimes in these experiments "appointment sittings"
F12 0540  2    are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date" with
F12 0550  2    a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased),
F12 0550 11    asking him to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel
F12 0560 11    will be open for him. In this case the proxy sitter
F12 0570  8    will know only the name of the communicator, nothing
F12 0580  2    else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed
F12 0590  1    time, and the reading then will be concerned with material
F12 0590 11    about or messages from the communicator. As always,
F12 0600  6    a tape recording or detailed notes are made, and a
F12 0610  6    typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.
F12 0620  1       So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial
F12 0620 12    barrier between the medium's ESP and the absent sitter's
F12 0630  9    mind. It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis
F12 0640 10    for the statements- though research still does not
F12 0650  5    know how far afield ESP can range.
F12 0660  1    ##
F12 0660  2    NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether
F12 0660 10    the statements are meaningful to him. Here again laboratory
F12 0670  9    approaches are being evolved, for it is recognized
F12 0680  8    how "elastic" these readings can be, how they can apply
F12 0690  7    to many people, and are often stated in general terms
F12 0700  4    all too easily applied to any individual's own case.
F12 0710  1    If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you
F12 0710 12    will probably see that many of the items could be considered
F12 0720 10    as applicable to you, even when you were not in the
F12 0730  8    picture at all! An interested sitter may think the
F12 0740  4    sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately
F12 0750  1    for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter,
F12 0750 12    hearing the same statement, would not apply it subjectively
F12 0760  9    to his own circumstances? It is, of course, easy to
F12 0770  7    see how "J" will mean Uncle Jack to one person and
F12 0780  7    little Jane to another. "A journey", "a little white
F12 0790  3    house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many people.
F12 0800  2    And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform
F12 0810  1    to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal.
F12 0810 13    One sitter may think "a leather couch" identifies a
F12 0820  8    reading as surely directed to him; to another, it seems
F12 0830  7    that nobody but his father ever used the phrase, "Atta
F12 0840  5    boy"!
F12 0840  6       To get around this quite difficult corner, there
F12 0850  3    is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the distant
F12 0860  2    sitter from knowing which reading was for him. If he
F12 0860 12    is not told which of four or five readings was meant
F12 0870 11    for him, he can more readily assess each item in a
F12 0880  7    larger frame: "Does that statement really sound as
F12 0890  4    if it were for me, significant in my particular life?
F12 0900  1    Or am I taking something that could really apply to
F12 0900 11    almost anybody, and forgetting that many other people
F12 0910  7    probably have had a similar experience"?
F12 0920  2       Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive
F12 0930  1    such statements as the following, which, if they turned
F12 0930 10    out to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:
F12 0940 12       "He had four children, two sets of twins. After
F12 0950  9    being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying
F12 0960  5    for the ministry. Part of his house had been moved
F12 0970  4    to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in
F12 0980  1    1921".
F12 0980  2       Methods have been developed of assigning "weights"
F12 0990  1    to statements; that is, it is known empirically that
F12 0990 10    names beginning with R are more common than those
F12 1000  8    beginning with Z; that fewer women are named Miranda
F12 1010  6    than Elizabeth; that in the United States more people
F12 1020  4    die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading
F12 1030  1    can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding
F12 1030 13    up these weights. Specific dates would be important,
F12 1040  7    as would double names. Various categories have been
F12 1050  5    explored to find out about these "empirical probabilities"
F12 1060  2    against which to measure the readings.
F12 1060  8    ##
F12 1060  9    IN THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment,
F12 1070  7    readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a
F12 1080 10    large number of cooperating sitters, trying to throw
F12 1090  5    light on this question of the significance of mediumistic
F12 1100  3    statements. It is very important indeed, in the field
F12 1110  1    of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the
F12 1110 10    survival hypothesis, to know whether the statements
F12 1120  6    are actually only those which any intuitive person
F12 1130  3    might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.
F12 1140  1    Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated,
F12 1140 11    facts which are in themselves significant and not easily
F12 1150  7    applicable to everybody? That is one thing the experiments
F12 1160  7    are designed to find out.
F12 1170  1       So, after the sitting has been held, several readings
F12 1170 10    at one time are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose
F12 1180  8    name or whose communicator's name was given to the
F12 1190  6    medium) must mark each little item as Correct (Hit),
F12 1200  2    Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant
F12 1200  8    (applying to him and, he feels, not to anyone else).
F12 1210 10    He is required to mark every item and to indicate which
F12 1220  8    reading he feels is actually his. All these evaluations
F12 1230  4    are then totted up and tabulated, by adding up the
F12 1240  3    Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those
F12 1240 12    in the sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as
F12 1250 10    most correct a reading not meant for him, the total
F12 1260  7    experimental score falls.
F12 1270  1       Conversely, if he gives a heavy rating to his own
F12 1270 10    reading, and finds more accurate facts in it than in
F12 1280  7    the others, a point is chalked up for the intrinsic,
F12 1290  3    objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic
F12 1290 10    material. And there are some positive results, though
F12 1300  8    the final findings will not be known for a long time-
F12 1310  9    and then further research can be formulated.
F12 1320  3       In another approach to the same procedure, the content
F12 1330  2    of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular
F12 1330 14    medium is likely to slant her statements. Does she
F12 1340  9    often speak of locations, of cause of death? Does she
F12 1350  7    accurately give dates, ages, kind of occupation? It
F12 1360  4    is possible to find out in which categories most of
F12 1370  2    her correct statements fall, and where she makes most
F12 1370 11    of her "hits". Now when, so to speak, the cream has
F12 1380  9    been skimmed off, and the items in the successful categories
F12 1390  6    separated out, the sitter can be asked to consider
F12 1400  3    and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the
F12 1410  1    sensitive is at her best.
F12 1410  6    ##
F12 1410  7    MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently of all sorts
F12 1420  4    and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold",
F12 1430  1    the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy".
F12 1440  1    Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such
F12 1440 10    a noise of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying",
F12 1450 10    or "He says we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe
F12 1460 10    an entire scene comes into consciousness, with action
F12 1470  5    and motion, or a static view: "a house under a pine
F12 1480  5    tree, with a little stone path going up to the door".
F12 1490  1    The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors,
F12 1490  9    too, or subjectively feels emotions. Sometimes she
F12 1500  5    displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all
F12 1510  6    details in perspective, as if the scene were actually
F12 1520  1    there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she
F12 1520 11    may be able to bring the picture more into focus and
F12 1530  9    see more sharply, almost as if she were physically
F12 1540  6    going closer.
F12 1540  8       If asked how she gets her impressions, she probably
F12 1550  5    can only say that she "just gets them"- some more vividly
F12 1560  6    than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after
F12 1570  2    all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions
F12 1570 10    without knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one
F12 1580  8    another's personalities, moods, intentions.
F12 1590  3       Of course, there is an element of training here:
F12 1600  2    these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance,
F12 1605  1    have learned to develop their power. Simply using it
F12 1610  9    increases its intensity, I was told by one sensitive.
F12 1620  7       Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret
F12 1630  5    her imagery. Impressions often appear in a symbolic
F12 1640  3    form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently
F12 1650  1    by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious,
F12 1650 10    and the medium has to translate these into meaning.
F12 1660  7    If communication with an entity on the "other side"
F12 1670  5    is taking place, this too may assume the form of clairvoyant
F12 1680  3    symbolism.
F12 1680  4       During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner
F12 1690  4    in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an
F12 1700  1    actual jail; taken with other details it could have
F12 1700 10    referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement.
F12 1710  6    In this connection it is worth noting how names are
F12 1720  5    sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard clairaudiently,
F12 1730  2    as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they
F12 1740  1    are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify
F12 1740 10    the name "Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets
F12 1750  9    flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was
F12 1760  8    significant to the sitter.
