G26 0010  1       All of which brings up another problem in the use
G26 0010 11    of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work. Is the
G26 0020  8    Oedipus complex, the clinical syndrome, material for
G26 0030  4    a tragedy? If we remove ourselves for a moment from
G26 0040  2    our time and our infatuation with mental disease, isn't
G26 0040 11    there something absurd about a hero in a novel who
G26 0050 10    is defeated by his infantile neurosis? I am not making
G26 0060  6    a clinical judgment here, for such personal tragedies
G26 0070  3    are real and are commonplace in the analyst's consulting
G26 0080  2    room, but literature makes a different claim upon our
G26 0080 11    sympathies than tragedy in life. A man in a novel who
G26 0090 11    is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious
G26 0100  5    forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure
G26 0110  4    in love, only makes us a little weary of man; his tragedy
G26 0120  3    seems unworthy and trivial.
G26 0120  7       Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus
G26 0130  6    Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious
G26 0140  2    longings of Oedipus projected outward, but this externalization
G26 0150  2    of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between
G26 0160  1    a story and a clinical case history. We can also argue
G26 0160 12    that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were
G26 0170  7    the external representatives of an internal conflict
G26 0180  5    within one man, Dostoevsky, a conflict having to do
G26 0200  2    with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's
G26 0200 12    woman. But a novel in which one man Karamazov explored
G26 0210  9    the divisions within his personality would scarcely
G26 0220  5    merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly.
G26 0230  2       It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus
G26 0240  2    Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex. Whatever
G26 0250  1    the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth, an Oedipus
G26 0250 10    who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces
G26 0260  8    can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime,
G26 0270  6    and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery
G26 0280  3    of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in
G26 0280 13    the secret. But a modern Oedipus who is doomed because
G26 0290 10    he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic,
G26 0300  7    and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological
G26 0310  5    truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies.
G26 0320  1       I am suggesting that a case-history approach to
G26 0320 10    the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller.
G26 0330  9    The best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the
G26 0340  6    reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist
G26 0350  3    may have in store for him. Incest is still a durable
G26 0360  1    theme, but if it wants to get written about it will
G26 0360 12    have to find ways to surprise the emotions, and there
G26 0370  7    is no better way to do this than that of concealment
G26 0380  4    and symbolic representation. And the best way to conceal
G26 0390  2    and disguise the elements of an incest story is not
G26 0390 12    to set out to write an incest story. Which brings to
G26 0400  9    mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons
G26 0410  5    in the treatment of the Oedipal theme.
G26 0420  2       "The Rocking Horse Winner" is also a story about
G26 0430  1    a boy's love for his mother. If I now risk some comparisons
G26 0430 13    with Sons and Lovers let it be clear that I am not
G26 0440 12    comparing the two works or judging their merits; I
G26 0450  7    am only singling out differences in treatment of a
G26 0460  5    theme and the resultant effects. "The Rocking Horse
G26 0470  1    Winner" is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb
G26 0470 10    the reader- but we do not know why. It is the story
G26 0480 11    of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and
G26 0490  9    vain mother. There are ghostly scenes in which the
G26 0500  4    little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward
G26 0500 13    the climax that will magically give him the name of
G26 0510 10    the winning horse. The child grows rich on his winnings
G26 0520  7    and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of
G26 0530  4    his money to his mother. The story ends in the child's
G26 0540  1    illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion
G26 0540 10    to ride his horse to win for his mother. The child
G26 0550 11    dies with his mourning mother at his bedside.
G26 0560  5       I had read the story many times without asking myself
G26 0570  3    why it affected me or caring why it did. But on one
G26 0580  1    occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a
G26 0580 10    little boy who was my patient I began to understand
G26 0590  7    the uncanny effects of this story. It was, of course,
G26 0600  5    a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself,
G26 0610  2    and replacing the father who could not give her the
G26 0610 12    things she wanted- a classical oedipal fantasy if you
G26 0620  7    like- but if it were only this the story would be banal.
G26 0630  8    Why does the story affect us? How does the rocking
G26 0640  4    exert its uncanny effect upon the reader? The rocking
G26 0650  2    is actually felt in the story, a terrible and ominous
G26 0650 12    rhythm that prophesies the tragedy. The rocking, I
G26 0660  7    realized, is the single element in the story that carries
G26 0670  6    the erotic message, the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent
G26 0680  3    that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and
G26 0690  2    disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit.
G26 0690 13    The rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the
G26 0700  9    erotic undercurrent silent and making it present; it
G26 0710  7    conceals and yet is suggestive; a perfect symbol. And
G26 0720  5    if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we
G26 0730  2    can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending
G26 0730 14    tragedy. For this love of the boy for his mother is
G26 0740 11    a hopeless and forbidden love, doomed by its nature.
G26 0750  6       We are also struck by the fact that this story of
G26 0760  5    a boy's love for his mother does not offend, while
G26 0770  1    the incestuous love of the man, Paul Morel, sometimes
G26 0770 10    repels. It's easy to see why. This love belongs to
G26 0780  9    childhood; we accord it its place there, and in Lawrence's
G26 0790  7    treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child,
G26 0800  5    in fact, the form in which oedipal love is expressed
G26 0810  1    in childhood. And when the child dies in Lawrence's
G26 0810 10    story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his
G26 0820 11    mania to win and to make his mother rich, the manifest
G26 0830  6    absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not
G26 0840  5    enter into our thoughts at all. We have so completely
G26 0850  1    entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his
G26 0850 10    death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion.
G26 0860  6       I am sure that none of the effects of this story
G26 0870  7    were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an
G26 0880  3    oedipal fantasy in childhood. It is most probable that
G26 0890  1    Freud and the Oedipus complex never entered his head
G26 0890 10    in the writing of this story. He was simply writing
G26 0900  8    a story that wanted to be told, and in the writing
G26 0910  5    a childhood fantasy of his own emerged. He would not
G26 0920  1    have cared why it emerged, he only wanted to capture
G26 0920 11    a memory to play with it again in his imagination and
G26 0930  8    somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing
G26 0940  4    emotions that accompanied the fantasy.
G26 0940  9       In our own time we have seen that the novelist's
G26 0950 10    debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel
G26 0960  7    itself has not profited much from this marriage. Ortega's
G26 0970  4    hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a
G26 0980  3    last flowering of the novel has only been partially
G26 0980 12    fulfilled. The young writer seems intimidated by psychological
G26 0990  8    knowledge; he has lost confidence in his own eyes and
G26 1000  9    in the validity of his own psychological insights.
G26 1010  2    He borrows the insights of psychology to improve his
G26 1020  2    impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive
G26 1020 12    vision that should be a novelist's own. He has been
G26 1030 10    seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost
G26 1040  7    interest in studying the surfaces of character. If
G26 1050  4    many of the characters in contemporary novels appear
G26 1060  1    to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case
G26 1060 11    history it is because the novelist is often forgetful
G26 1070  7    today that those things that we call character manifest
G26 1080  5    themselves in surface behavior, that the ego is still
G26 1090  3    the executive agency of personality, and that all we
G26 1090 12    know of personality must be discerned through the ego.
G26 1100  8    The novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis
G26 1110  6    often gives us the impression that since all men must
G26 1120  5    have an Oedipus complex all men must have the same
G26 1130  2    faces.
G26 1130  3    #II.#
G26 1130  4    I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has
G26 1140  3    a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature.
G26 1140 12    But a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees
G26 1150 11    incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination
G26 1160  6    work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth, the
G26 1170  4    joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness.
G26 1180  1    Moral dread is seen as the other face of desire, and
G26 1180 12    here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent
G26 1190  7    irony and a moral problem of great complexity.
G26 1200  4       There is probably some significance in the fact
G26 1210  4    that two of the best incest stories I have encountered
G26 1220  1    in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth.
G26 1220 10    The ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding
G26 1230  7    to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies, but the
G26 1240  4    myth fails before the modern truth; the oracle speaks
G26 1250  2    false and the dream speaks true. In both the farmer's
G26 1250 12    tale in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and in Thomas
G26 1260  9    Mann's The Holy Sinner, the incest hero rises above
G26 1270  8    the myth by accepting the wish as motive; the heroic
G26 1280  7    act is the casting off of pretense.
G26 1290  1       Thomas Mann wrote The Holy Sinner in 1951. It was
G26 1290 11    conceived as a leave-taking, a kind of melancholy gathering-in
G26 1300 11    of the myths of the West, "bevor die Nacht sinkt, eine
G26 1310  9    lange Nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes Vergessen". He
G26 1320  6    chose a medieval legend of incest, Gregorius vom Stein,
G26 1330  5    and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the
G26 1340  4    West, mixing themes, language, peoples and times in
G26 1340 12    a master myth in which the old forms continually renew
G26 1350  9    themselves, as in his previous treatment of Joseph.
G26 1360  5       But The Holy Sinner is not simply a retelling of
G26 1370  6    old stories for an old man's entertainment. Mann understood
G26 1380  3    better than most men the incest comedy at the center
G26 1390  1    of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread
G26 1390 11    is shown as the other face as longing was for him just
G26 1400 10    the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell.
G26 1410  6    And when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated
G26 1420  3    a modern version in which the medieval players speak
G26 1430  1    contemporary thoughts in archaic language; while they
G26 1430  8    move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth
G26 1440  8    and cover themselves through not-knowing, they reveal
G26 1450  5    the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in
G26 1460  3    the last scene make an extraordinary confession of
G26 1460 11    guilt in the twentieth-century manner.
G26 1470  4       Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between
G26 1480  3    a royal brother and sister, the twins Sibylla and Wiligis.
G26 1490  2    He is born in secrecy after the death of his father
G26 1490 13    and cast adrift soon after birth. The infant is discovered
G26 1500  9    by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him. An
G26 1510  8    ivory tablet in the infant's cask recounts the story
G26 1520  4    of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child
G26 1530  1    by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village.
G26 1530 11    Grigorss, at seventeen, learns his story and goes forth
G26 1540  8    as a knight to uncover his origins. His sailing vessel
G26 1550  5    is guided by fate to the shores of his own country
G26 1560  2    at a time when Sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies
G26 1570  1    of one of her rejected suitors. Grigorss overcomes
G26 1570  9    the suitor in battle, delivers the city from its oppressors
G26 1580  7    and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the
G26 1590  6    beautiful knight the moment she saw him.
G26 1600  1       Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when
G26 1600  9    she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband,
G26 1610  6    and the identities of mother and son are revealed.
G26 1620  3    Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen
G26 1630  1    years. At the end of this period two pious Christians
G26 1630 11    in Rome receive the revelation which leads them to
G26 1640  7    seek the next Pope on the rock. Grigorss comes to Rome
G26 1650  5    and becomes a great and beloved Pope. In the last pages
G26 1660  4    of the book Sibylla comes to Rome to seek an audience
G26 1670  1    with the great Pope and to give her confession. Mother
G26 1670 11    and son recognize each other and, in Mann's version
G26 1680  7    of this legend, make a remarkable confession of guilt
G26 1690  4    to each other, the confession of unconscious motive
G26 1700  2    and unconscious knowledge of their true identities
G26 1700  9    from the time they had first set eyes on each other.
