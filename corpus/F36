F36 0010  1    IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them
F36 0010 12    near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the
F36 0020  9    night before, and he circled once, nose to the ground,
F36 0030  6    hair shooting up along his back, as it did when he
F36 0040  3    was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head
F36 0040 14    and bayed, and the pack joined in, all heads high,
F36 0050  9    and Jones knew it was a hot trail.
F36 0060  2       He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him
F36 0070  1    straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain.
F36 0070  8    This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose
F36 0080  9    almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet,
F36 0090  4    honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub
F36 0100  1    and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended
F36 0100 11    sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly.
F36 0110  9       Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together
F36 0120  6    while Jones followed the dogs, and Means and Loveless
F36 0130  3    had taken another route, and now, with the discovery
F36 0140  1    of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined
F36 0140 11    in, in the shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton
F36 0150  8    focussed his field glasses.
F36 0160  1       "That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see
F36 0160 10    the dogs".
F36 0170  2       As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef.
F36 0180  1    Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the
F36 0180 11    plain in front of him. The dogs were working a trail-
F36 0190  9    lion? hyena? The pack had made a bend to the north,
F36 0200  8    swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton and Ulyate
F36 0210  3    could hear them faintly.
F36 0210  7       Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that
F36 0220  7    grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a
F36 0230  4    heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would
F36 0230 14    bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party.
F36 0240  9       "Not yet", cautioned Ulyate.
F36 0250  2       Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern
F36 0260  1    toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly,
F36 0260 12    Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above
F36 0270  8    the others. There was Sounder, too, also a veteran
F36 0280  7    of the North Rim, and Rastus and the Rake from a pack
F36 0290  6    of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London pound,
F36 0300  2    and Simba, a terrier ... A motley pack, chosen for
F36 0300 12    effectiveness, not beauty. Jones was galloping close
F36 0310  7    behind them leaning down, cheering them on.
F36 0320  5       "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton touched a match
F36 0330  4    to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked out.
F36 0340  2    He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column
F36 0340 13    of smoke rose.
F36 0350  1       "That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where
F36 0350 11    we are".
F36 0360  2       Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus
F36 0360 11    of wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of
F36 0370 10    a lion.
F36 0370 12       Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began
F36 0380  9    to gallop toward the sound. It came from the top of
F36 0390  7    the Reef not half a mile away. At the base of the rocky
F36 0400  5    hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot.
F36 0410  1    The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers
F36 0410 10    and bushes, so thickly overgrown that when Kearton
F36 0420  6    lost sight of Ulyate and called, Ulyate answered from
F36 0430  4    ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in face
F36 0440  2    to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound
F36 0440 12    of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring
F36 0450  9    of the lion, till they came, out of breath, to the
F36 0460  7    crest, and peering through the branches of a bush,
F36 0470  3    this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and
F36 0470 13    actually had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside,
F36 0480  8    sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a
F36 0490  8    full-grown young lioness, who was crouched on a flat
F36 0500  4    rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the
F36 0510  1    dogs whirled around her.
F36 0510  5       Ulyate drew back with a start, and put finger to
F36 0520  3    lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set
F36 0520 13    her off, "The dogs have got her bayed ... She's just
F36 0530 11    the other side of that bush"! And when they had drawn
F36 0540  9    back a step he added: "Jones is sitting on his horse
F36 0550  7    right in front of her. Why she doesn't charge him,
F36 0570  3    I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on him.
F36 0580  2    He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground
F36 0580 13    ... Careful, don't disturb her".
F36 0590  4    ##
F36 0590  5    Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from
F36 0600  5    her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef.
F36 0610  2    She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground
F36 0610 13    and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared,
F36 0620 11    opening her mouth wide, lashing her tail, and stamping
F36 0630  6    at the rock with both forefeet in irritation, as much
F36 0640  4    as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct"?
F36 0650  2       Intuition told him, however, that she was tired
F36 0660  1    and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge,
F36 0660 13    yet. He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of
F36 0670  9    her, being careful, because he knew the female is less
F36 0680  7    predictable than the male. (In the graveyard at Nairobi
F36 0690  3    he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game
F36 0700  1    hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting
F36 0700  9    to lasso. Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed
F36 0710  9    by lions, and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses.)
F36 0720  6    She snarled terribly but intuition told him, again,
F36 0740  3    that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her
F36 0750  1    attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the
F36 0750 10    lasso. It was falling over her head when a branch of
F36 0760  8    a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the
F36 0770  5    rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could
F36 0780  1    catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's
F36 0780 11    rear end was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona
F36 0790 10    no matter- and she changed ends and took a swipe at
F36 0800  8    John, but he ducked back.
F36 0810  1       Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again, this
F36 0810  9    time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle
F36 0820  7    her. She whirled and faced him, roaring terribly, and
F36 0830  3    Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand
F36 0840  1    why she did not charge and obliterate him, because
F36 0840 10    he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away,
F36 0850  9    in that thick growth, but she seemed just a trace uncertain;
F36 0860  6    while Jones, on the other hand, appeared perfectly
F36 0870  2    confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.
F36 0880  1       From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature
F36 0890  1    on the back of another creature, lashing out with its
F36 0890 11    long thin paw, very likely appeared as something she
F36 0900  7    could not at first cope with. But now she sank lower
F36 0910  5    to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her tail
F36 0930  1    no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued
F36 0930  9    and defeated, Jones knew she was growing more dangerous.
F36 0940  8    She was rested and could mount a charge. Just the tip
F36 0950  7    of her tail was moving as she crouched, and she was
F36 0960  4    treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.
F36 0970  1       At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing
F36 0970  9    through the undergrowth with their horses, and distracted
F36 0980  6    her, and she ran off a short distance and jumped into
F36 0990  5    a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed her
F36 1000  2    and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.
F36 1010  1       "We've got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled,
F36 1010 10    "or she'll kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".
F36 1020  8       For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July
F36 1030  8    cannon crackers as part of their equipment. Lighting
F36 1040  4    one he pitched it into the crevice, and the lioness
F36 1050  2    left off mauling the dogs and departed.
F36 1050  9       "Ain't she a beauty, though"? called out Means as
F36 1060  8    she ran.
F36 1060 10       "Don't you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones
F36 1070 11    warned, "and if you do, go at a run so you'll have
F36 1080 10    momentum"!
F36 1080 11       For two hours they drove her from one strong point
F36 1090  8    to another along the side of the Reef, trying to maneuver
F36 1100  6    her onto the plain where they could get a good throw.
F36 1110  4    But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore
F36 1120  1    away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were
F36 1120 12    tired too. It was the story of the rhinoceros fight
F36 1130  8    all over again. And the sun was beginning to go down.
F36 1140  5    If dark came they would lose her.
F36 1140 12       "I'll get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll
F36 1150  9    poke a noose over her head"!
F36 1170  2       At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture
F36 1180  2    halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his
F36 1180 12    face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions'
F36 1190 10    heads with poles, and of course these were the lions
F36 1200  8    of fifty years ago, not the gentler ones of today,
F36 1210  4    and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless,
F36 1220  1    too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".
F36 1220  7       "Just the same we'll try it".
F36 1230  5       But without waiting for them to try it, she scattered
F36 1240  3    the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the
F36 1240 14    plain.
F36 1250  1       John led the chase after her and the other dogs
F36 1250 11    strung out behind, many of them trailing blood. John
F36 1260  8    himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail, but
F36 1270  7    he was in this fight to the finish, running almost
F36 1280  2    as strongly now as in the morning.
F36 1280  9       She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into
F36 1290  8    a gully, crouched at the base of a thorn tree, and
F36 1300  4    waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot
F36 1300 15    well. With the gully on three sides, she could be approached
F36 1310 11    only along the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones
F36 1320  8    warned.
F36 1320  9       Means tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered
F36 1330  8    his rawboned bay gelding, edging closer, watching for
F36 1340  5    a chance to throw, but ready to spin and run, rope
F36 1350  3    whining about his head, horse edging tensely under
F36 1350 11    him, but the gelding was obedient and responded and
F36 1360  8    was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion.
F36 1370  5    They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell
F36 1380  3    of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.
F36 1380 12       Means edged closer. She snarled warningly. Means
F36 1390  6    spit and edged on. Again she snarled, and again he
F36 1400  5    edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling
F36 1410  1    jump, it could get into gear ... However nothing on
F36 1410 11    four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over
F36 1420 10    a short distance, unless it was a cheetah.
F36 1430  5       She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty
F36 1440  1    yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within
F36 1440 10    one more bound would have been able to reach the rear
F36 1450  9    end of the bay, but- and here Jones and Loveless and
F36 1460  6    Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth-
F36 1470  3    she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held
F36 1480  1    steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began
F36 1480 11    to pull away. A Western cowpony had outrun an African
F36 1490  8    lion, from a standing start. Photos showed later that
F36 1500  5    she'd been about six feet from Means ... Of course
F36 1510  3    the factor of head start made all the difference. How
F36 1510 13    much head start? No one knew exactly. That was the
F36 1520 10    whole question. Enough, was the answer.
F36 1530  5       The lioness quickly changed front, when she saw
F36 1550  3    she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she
F36 1550 13    had done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but
F36 1560 10    then Baldy began to draw away. Somewhere in the few
F36 1570  8    scant yards of head start was the determining point.
F36 1580  3       When Jones too drew away, she returned to a thorn
F36 1590  3    bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched
F36 1590 14    low and waited as before. This new position, however,
F36 1600  9    gave the ropers a better chance. There was room to
F36 1610  7    make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went.
F36 1620  5    So: Means edged around on the north side of her, Jones
F36 1630  2    moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting
F36 1630 12    he attracted her attention. He succeeded almost too
F36 1640  7    well, because once she rose as if to charge, and he
F36 1650  8    half wheeled his horse- he was within fifty feet- but
F36 1660  4    she sank back.
F36 1660  7       From behind her Means shot forward at a run. Kearton
F36 1670  6    began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's jammed"!
F36 1680  2    But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet of
F36 1690  2    her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck
F36 1690 12    is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped
F36 1700  9    the noose off.
