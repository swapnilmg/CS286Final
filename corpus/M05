M05 0010  1       She lived and was given a name. Helva. For her first
M05 0010 12    three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws,
M05 0020  7    kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the
M05 0030  5    usual routine of the infant. She was not alone for
M05 0040  2    there were three other such children in the big city's
M05 0040 12    special nursery. Soon they all were removed to Central
M05 0050  9    Laboratory School where their delicate transformation
M05 0060  5    began.
M05 0060  6       One of the babies died in the initial transferral
M05 0070  6    but of Helva's "class", seventeen thrived in the metal
M05 0080  5    shells. Instead of kicking feet, Helva's neural responses
M05 0090  3    started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands,
M05 0100  1    she manipulated mechanical extensions. As she matured,
M05 0100  8    more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to
M05 0110  7    operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance
M05 0120  4    and running of a space ship. For Helva was destined
M05 0130  2    to be the "brain" half of a scout ship, partnered with
M05 0130 13    a man or a woman, whichever she chose, as the mobile
M05 0140 11    half. She would be among the elite of her kind. Her
M05 0150  8    initial intelligence tests registered above normal
M05 0160  3    and her adaptation index was unusually high. As long
M05 0170  1    as her development within her shell lived up to expectations,
M05 0170 11    and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering,
M05 0180  9    Helva would live a rewarding, rich and unusual life,
M05 0190  7    a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary,
M05 0200  5    "normal" being.
M05 0200  7       However, no diagram of her brain patterns, no early
M05 0210  7    I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva
M05 0220  4    that Central must eventually learn. They would have
M05 0230  3    to bide their official time and see, trusting that
M05 0230 12    the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice
M05 0240  7    her, too, as the necessary bulwark against her unusual
M05 0250  5    confinement and the pressures of her profession. A
M05 0260  2    ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane
M05 0260 14    with the power and resources Central had to build into
M05 0270 10    their scout ships. Brain ships were, of course, long
M05 0280  7    past the experimental stages. Most babes survived the
M05 0290  4    techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their
M05 0300  2    bodies small, eliminating the necessity of transfers
M05 0300  9    from smaller to larger shells. And very, very few were
M05 0310  9    lost when the final connection was made to the control
M05 0320  6    panels of ship or industrial combine. Shell people
M05 0330  2    resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal
M05 0330 10    deformities were, but the well-oriented brain would
M05 0340  8    not have changed places with the most perfect body
M05 0350  6    in the Universe.
M05 0350  9       So, for happy years, Helva scooted around in her
M05 0360  6    shell with her classmates, playing such games as Stall,
M05 0370  4    Power-Seek, studying her lessons in trajectory, propulsion
M05 0380  2    techniques, computation, logistics, mental hygiene,
M05 0380  7    basic alien psychology, philology, space history, law,
M05 0390  7    traffic, codes: all the et ceteras that eventually
M05 0400  6    became compounded into a reasoning, logical, informed
M05 0410  2    citizen. Not so obvious to her, but of more importance
M05 0420  1    to her teachers, Helva ingested the precepts of her
M05 0420 10    conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient
M05 0430  7    fluid. She would one day be grateful to the patient
M05 0440  4    drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.
M05 0450  1       Helva's civilization was not without busy, do-good
M05 0450  9    associations, exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial
M05 0460  6    as well as extraterrestrial citizens. One such group
M05 0470  5    got all incensed over shelled "children" when Helva
M05 0480  3    was just turning fourteen. When they were forced to,
M05 0490  2    Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders, arranged a tour
M05 0490 10    of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a
M05 0500  9    big start by showing the members case histories, complete
M05 0510  5    with photographs. Very few committees ever looked past
M05 0520  4    the first few photos. Most of their original objections
M05 0530  1    about "shells" were overridden by the relief that these
M05 0530 10    hideous (to them) bodies were mercifully concealed.
M05 0540  7       Helva's class was doing Fine Arts, a selective subject
M05 0550  9    in her crowded program. She had activated one of her
M05 0560  7    microscopic tools which she would later use for minute
M05 0570  4    repairs to various parts of her control panel. Her
M05 0580  1    subject was large- a copy of the Last Supper- and her
M05 0590 11    canvas, small- the head of a tiny screw. She had tuned
M05 0600 12    her sight to the proper degree. As she worked she absentmindedly
M05 0610  7    crooned, producing a curious sound. Shell people used
M05 0620  5    their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued
M05 0630  2    through microphones rather than mouths. Helva's hum
M05 0630  9    then had a curious vibrancy, a warm, dulcet quality
M05 0640  9    even in its aimless chromatic wanderings.
M05 0650  2       "Why, what a lovely voice you have", said one of
M05 0660  4    the female visitors.
M05 0660  7       Helva "looked" up and caught a fascinating panorama
M05 0670  4    of regular, dirty craters on a flaky pink surface.
M05 0680  1    Her hum became a gurgle of surprise. She instinctively
M05 0680 10    regulated her "sight" until the skin lost its cratered
M05 0690  9    look and the pores assumed normal proportions.
M05 0700  4       "Yes, we have quite a few years of voice training,
M05 0710  4    madam", remarked Helva calmly. "Vocal peculiarities
M05 0720  1    often become excessively irritating during prolonged
M05 0720  7    intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated. I enjoyed
M05 0730  8    my lessons".
M05 0740  1       Although this was the first time that Helva had
M05 0740 10    seen unshelled people, she took this experience calmly.
M05 0750  7    Any other reaction would have been reported instantly.
M05 0760  4       "I meant that you have a nice singing voice ...
M05 0770  3    dear", the lady amended.
M05 0770  7       "Thank you. Would you like to see my work"? Helva
M05 0780  8    asked, politely. She instinctively sheered away from
M05 0790  4    personal discussions but she filed the comment away
M05 0800  1    for further meditation.
M05 0800  4       "Work"? asked the lady.
M05 0810  1       "I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the
M05 0810 10    head of a screw".
M05 0820  1       "O, I say", the lady twittered.
M05 0820  7       Helva turned her vision back to magnification and
M05 0830  7    surveyed her copy critically.
M05 0840  1       "Of course, some of my color values do not match
M05 0840 11    the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but
M05 0850  7    I believe it to be a fair copy".
M05 0860  2       The lady's eyes, unmagnified, bugged out.
M05 0870  1       "Oh, I forget", and Helva's voice was really contrite.
M05 0870 10    If she could have blushed, she would have. "You people
M05 0880  9    don't have adjustable vision".
M05 0890  2       The monitor of this discourse grinned with pride
M05 0900  1    and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the
M05 0900 10    unfortunate.
M05 0910  1       "Here, this will help", suggested Helva, substituting
M05 0920  1    a magnifying device in one extension and holding it
M05 0920 10    over the picture.
M05 0930  1       In a kind of shock, the ladies and gentlemen of
M05 0930 11    the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied
M05 0940  7    and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of
M05 0950  6    a screw.
M05 0950  8       "Well", remarked one gentleman who had been forced
M05 0960  5    to accompany his wife, "the good Lord can eat where
M05 0970  3    angels fear to tread".
M05 0970  7       "Are you referring, sir", asked Helva politely,
M05 0980  4    "to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels
M05 0990  3    who could stand on the head of a pin"?
M05 0990 12       "I had that in mind".
M05 1000  4       "If you substitute 'atom' for 'angel', the problem
M05 1010  3    is not insoluble, given the metallic content of the
M05 1020  1    pin in question".
M05 1020  4       "Which you are programed to compute"?
M05 1030  1       "Of course".
M05 1030  3       "Did they remember to program a sense of humor,
M05 1040  4    as well, young lady"?
M05 1040  8       "We are directed to develop a sense of proportion,
M05 1050  7    sir, which contributes the same effect".
M05 1060  1       The good man chortled appreciatively and decided
M05 1060  8    the trip was worth his time.
M05 1070  5       If the investigation committee spent months digesting
M05 1080  2    the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School,
M05 1090  1    they left Helva with a morsel as well.
M05 1090  9       "Singing" as applicable to herself required research.
M05 1100  6    She had, of course, been exposed to and enjoyed a music
M05 1110  6    appreciation course which had included the better known
M05 1120  3    classical works such as "Tristan und Isolde", "Candide",
M05 1130  1    "Oklahoma", "Nozze de Figaro", the atomic age singers,
M05 1140  1    Eileen Farrell, Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd, as
M05 1140  9    well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians,
M05 1150  9    Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of
M05 1160  7    the Altairians. But "singing" for any shell person
M05 1170  5    posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome.
M05 1180  4    Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect
M05 1180 12    of a problem or situation before making a prognosis.
M05 1190  9    Balanced properly between optimism and practicality,
M05 1200  5    the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them
M05 1210  4    to extricate themselves, their ships and personnel,
M05 1220  1    from bizarre situations. Therefore to Helva, the problem
M05 1220  9    that she couldn't open her mouth to sing, among other
M05 1230  9    restrictions, did not bother her. She would work out
M05 1240  7    a method, by-passing her limitations, whereby she could
M05 1250  4    sing.
M05 1250  5       She approached the problem by investigating the
M05 1260  2    methods of sound reproduction through the centuries,
M05 1260  9    human and instrumental. Her own sound production equipment
M05 1270  7    was essentially more instrumental than vocal. Breath
M05 1280  5    control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds
M05 1290  4    within the oral cavity appeared to require the most
M05 1300  1    development and practice. Shell people did not, strictly
M05 1300  9    speaking, breathe. For their purposes, oxygen and other
M05 1310  7    gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere
M05 1320  4    through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially
M05 1330  2    by solution in their shells. After experimentation,
M05 1330  9    Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic
M05 1340  8    unit to sustain tone. By relaxing the throat muscles
M05 1350  7    and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal
M05 1360  5    sinuses, she could direct the vowel sounds into the
M05 1370  2    most felicitous position for proper reproduction through
M05 1370  9    her throat microphone. She compared the results with
M05 1380  7    tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased
M05 1390  6    although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about
M05 1400  3    them, not at all unharmonious, merely unique. Acquiring
M05 1410  1    a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem
M05 1410 10    to one trained to perfect recall. She found herself
M05 1420  7    able to sing any role and any song which struck her
M05 1430  5    fancy. It would not have occurred to her that it was
M05 1440  3    curious for a female to sing bass, baritone, tenor,
M05 1440 12    alto, mezzo, soprano and coloratura as she pleased.
M05 1450  7    It was, to Helva, only a matter of the correct reproduction
M05 1460  5    and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted.
M05 1470  3       If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation,
M05 1480  2    they did so among themselves. Shell people were encouraged
M05 1490  1    to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency
M05 1490 11    in their technical work.
M05 1500  2       On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her
M05 1510  1    shell, Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed
M05 1510  8    in her ship, the XH-834. Her permanent titanium shell
M05 1520  8    was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier
M05 1530  5    in the central shaft of the scout ship. The neural,
M05 1540  3    audio, visual and sensory connections were made and
M05 1550  1    sealed. Her extendibles were diverted, connected or
M05 1550  8    augmented and the final, delicate-beyond-description
M05 1560  5    brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically
M05 1570  3    unaware of the proceedings. When she awoke, she was
M05 1580  3    the ship. Her brain and intelligence controlled every
M05 1590  1    function from navigation to such loading as a scout
M05 1590 10    ship of her class needed. She could take care of herself
M05 1600  8    and her ambulatory half, in any situation already recorded
M05 1610  4    in the annals of Central Worlds and any situation its
M05 1620  3    most fertile minds could imagine.
M05 1620  8       Her first actual flight, for she and her kind had
M05 1630  8    made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight,
M05 1640  5    showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her
M05 1650  3    profession. She was ready for her great adventures
M05 1650 11    and the arrival of her mobile partner.
M05 1660  5       There were nine qualified scouts sitting around
M05 1670  2    collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned.
M05 1670 10    There were several missions which demanded instant
M05 1680  7    attention but Helva had been of interest to several
M05 1690  7    department heads in Central for some time and each
M05 1700  4    man was determined to have her assigned to his section.
M05 1710  1    Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva
M05 1710  9    to the prospective partners. The ship always chose
M05 1720  6    its own partner. Had there been another "brain" ship
M05 1730  5    at the Base at the moment, Helva would have been guided
M05 1740  4    to make the first move. As it was, while Central wrangled
M05 1750  1    among itself, Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots'
M05 1750 10    barracks, out to the field and over to Helva's slim
M05 1760 10    metal hull.
M05 1770  1       "Hello, anyone at home"? Tanner wisecracked.
M05 1770  6       "Of course", replied Helva logically, activating
M05 1780  5    her outside scanners. "Are you my partner"? she asked
M05 1790  6    hopefully, as she recognized the Scout Service uniform.
M05 1800  4       "All you have to do is ask", he retorted hopefully.
M05 1810  2       "No one has come. I thought perhaps there were no
M05 1820  3    partners available and I've had no directives from
M05 1820 11    Central".
M05 1830  1       Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying
M05 1830 10    but the truth was she was lonely, sitting on the darkened
M05 1840 11    field. Always she had had the company of other shells
M05 1850  9    and more recently, technicians by the score. The sudden
M05 1860  6    solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive.
M05 1870  3       "No directives from Central is scarcely a cause
M05 1880  3    for regret, but there happen to be eight other guys
M05 1880 13    biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting
M05 1890  7    for an invitation to board you, you beautiful thing".
