B13 0010  1       Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are
B13 0010  8    anything but kind to the feet. That is why it is important
B13 0020 11    to invest in comfortable, airy types of shoes.
B13 0030  5       There are many soft and light shoe leathers available.
B13 0040  3    Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness
B13 0050  1    achieved via unlined leathers. Softness is found in
B13 0050  9    crushed textures.
B13 0060  2       Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with
B13 0070  1    elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape. Heels
B13 0070 10    place emphasis on the long legged silhouette. Wine
B13 0090  5    glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights.
B13 0100  4    Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored
B13 0110  1    shoes. Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found
B13 0110 11    on teenage pumps.
B13 0120  2    #COOLEST SHADE#
B13 0120  4    While white is the coolest summer shade, there are
B13 0130  3    lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that
B13 0130 12    will blend with any wardrobe color.
B13 0140  5       In the tintable group are high and little heels,
B13 0150  3    squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.
B13 0160  1       Don't overlook the straws this year. They come in
B13 0160 10    crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues, along with
B13 0170  8    lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural,
B13 0180  5    white, black and a whole range of colors. In the casual
B13 0190  3    field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved
B13 0190 12    wood in a variety of styles. For added comfort some
B13 0200  9    of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning.
B13 0210  6       The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to
B13 0220  6    be found afoot. Orange and lemon are considered important
B13 0230  2    as are such pastels as blue and lilac. In a brighter
B13 0230 13    nautical vein is Ille de France blue. Contrast trim
B13 0240  9    provides other touches of color. Spectators in white
B13 0250  6    crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black, navy
B13 0260  5    and taffy tan.
B13 0260  8    #DESIGNED FOR EASE#
B13 0260 11    Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated.
B13 0270  8    At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light,
B13 0280  8    but crisp texture. In a lacey open weave shoes have
B13 0290  4    a luster finish, braided collar and bow highlight on
B13 0300  1    the squared throat. At right is a casual style in a
B13 0300 12    crushed unlined white leather. Flats have a scalloped
B13 0310  7    throat.
B13 0320  1       An electric toothbrush (Broxodent) may soon take
B13 0320  8    its place next to the electric razor in the American
B13 0330  8    bathroom. The brush moves up and down and is small
B13 0340  6    enough to clean every dental surface, including the
B13 0350  2    back of the teeth. In addition, the motor has the seal
B13 0350 13    of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories, which
B13 0360  6    means it is safe.
B13 0370  1       The unit consists of a small motor that goes on
B13 0370 10    as soon as it is plugged in. The speed is controlled
B13 0380  6    by pressing on the two brake buttons located where
B13 0390  3    the index finger and thumb are placed when holding
B13 0390 12    the motor. The bushes can be cleaned and sterilized
B13 0400  9    by boiling and are detachable so that every member
B13 0410  5    of the family can have his own.
B13 0420  1       Most of us brush our teeth by hand. The same can
B13 0420 12    be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved
B13 0430  7    useful to many men.
B13 0430 11       The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction,
B13 0440  7    the way dentists recommend. In addition, it is small
B13 0450  6    enough to get into crevices, jacket and crown margins,
B13 0460  3    malposed anteriors, and the back teeth. The bristles
B13 0470  1    are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch
B13 0470 11    the enamel.
B13 0480  1       It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better
B13 0480 10    job than ordinary bushing, especially in those who
B13 0490  6    do not brush their teeth properly. Several dentists
B13 0500  3    and patients with special dental problems have experimented
B13 0510  1    with the device. The results were good although they
B13 0510 10    are difficult to compare with hand brushing, particularly
B13 0520  7    when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly.
B13 0530  8    The electric gadget is most helpful when there are
B13 0540  4    many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly,
B13 0550  1    bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped
B13 0550  9    by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.
B13 0560  8       But for many of us, it will prove an enjoyable luxury.
B13 0570  8    It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush
B13 0580  4    and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles. Since
B13 0590  1    the apparatus is new, it requires experimentation and
B13 0590  9    changes in technique.

B13 0610  4    which awakens the person, indicate brain tumor?
B13 0620  1    _REPLY_
B13 0620  1       No. This is a common symptom and the cause usually
B13 0620 11    is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand.
B13 0630  9    The pressure may come from muscles, tendons, or bones
B13 0640  5    anywhere from the neck to the hand.

B13 0660  1    _REPLY_
B13 0660  2       No, other than cleaning out the pores and making
B13 0660 11    the sweat glands work harder. An ordinary hot bath
B13 0670  8    or shower will do the same.

B13 0690  3    _REPLY_
B13 0690  4       There are many possibilities, including poor circulation,
B13 0700  3    a variety of neurological conditions, and functional
B13 0710  1    disorders. This manifestation may be an early sign
B13 0710  9    of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer's cramp.

B13 0730  8    _REPLY_
B13 0730  9       A back brace might help, depending upon the cause
B13 0740  7    of sciatica.
B13 0740  9    #CHOLESTEROL AND THYROID#
B13 0750  2    @ writes: Does the cholesterol go down when most of
B13 0760  1    the thyroid gland is removed?
B13 0760  6    _REPLY_
B13 0760  7       No. It usually goes up. The cholesterol level in
B13 0770  5    the blood is influenced by the glands of the body.
B13 0780  2    It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when
B13 0780 13    the gland is sluggish. The latter is likely to occur
B13 0790  9    when the thyroid is removed.
B13 0810  1       The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet
B13 0810 10    grows smaller with each new recording catalogue.
B13 0820  6       There's more reading and instruction to be heard
B13 0830  6    on discs than ever before, although the spoken rather
B13 0840  2    than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's
B13 0850  1    first experiment in recorded sound. Edison could hardly
B13 0850  9    have guessed, however, that Sophocles would one day
B13 0860  7    appear in stereo.
B13 0860 10       If the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic
B13 0870  8    or even the slightest bit esoteric, he will find them
B13 0880  7    satisfied on educational records. And he will avoid
B13 0890  4    eye-strain in the process.
B13 0890  9       Everything from poetry to phonetics, history to
B13 0900  5    histrionics, philosophy to party games has been adapted
B13 0910  4    to the turntable.
B13 0910  7       For sheer ambition, take the Decca series titled
B13 0920  4    modestly "Wisdom". Volumes One and Two, selected from
B13 0930  3    the sound tracks of a television series, contain "conversations
B13 0940  1    with the elder wise men of our day".
B13 0940  9       These sages include poet Carl Sandburg, statesman
B13 0950  6    Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, in
B13 0960  4    Volume One, and playwright Sean O'Casey, David Ben-Gurion,
B13 0970  4    philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd
B13 0980  2    Wright in the second set. Hugh Downs is heard interviewing
B13 0990  1    Wright, for an added prestige fillip.
B13 0990  7       There's more specialization and a narrower purpose
B13 1000  5    in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications.
B13 1010  2    Dover "publishes" what the company calls "Listen and
B13 1020  2    Learn" productions designed to teach foreign languages.
B13 1030  1    Previous presentations have been on French, Spanish,
B13 1030  8    Russian, Italian, German and Japanese.
B13 1040  4       But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and
B13 1050  3    the tourist's desire to visit the "smaller, less-traveled
B13 1060  1    and relatively inexpensive countries", and is now prepared
B13 1060  9    to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings.
B13 1070  8    The respective vocabularies "essential for travel"
B13 1080  5    are available in separate albums.
B13 1090  2       Thanks to Spoken Arts Records, history buffs may
B13 1090 10    hear Lincoln's "most memorable speeches and letters"
B13 1100  7    in a two-disc set, interpreted by Lincoln authority
B13 1110  6    and lecturer Roy P. Basler. As a comtemporary bonus,
B13 1120  5    the set includes Carl Sandburg's address at a joint
B13 1130  4    session of Congress, delivered on Lincoln's birthday
B13 1140  1    two years ago.
B13 1140  4       For those who "like poetry but never get around
B13 1150  2    to reading it", the Library of Congress makes it possible
B13 1160  1    for poets to be heard reading their own work. The program
B13 1160 12    was instituted in 1940, and releases are available
B13 1170  7    only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of
B13 1180  5    Congress, Washington 25, D. C. A catalogue is available
B13 1190  3    on request.
B13 1190  5       Newest on the list are John Ciardi, W. D. Snodgrass,
B13 1200  5    I. A. Richards, Oscar Williams, Robert Hillyer, John
B13 1210  4    Hall Wheelock, Stephen Vincent Benet, Edwin Muir, John
B13 1220  4    Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim. Two poets are paired
B13 1230  3    on each record, in the order given above.
B13 1230 11       Decca is not the only large commercial company to
B13 1240  8    impart instruction. RCA Victor has an ambitious and
B13 1250  6    useful project in a stereo series called "Adventures
B13 1260  2    in Music", which is an instructional record library
B13 1270  1    for elementary schools. Howard Mitchell and the National
B13 1270  9    Symphony perform in the first two releases, designed
B13 1280  8    for grades one and two. Teaching guides are included
B13 1290  4    with each record.
B13 1300  1       In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen
B13 1300 10    upsets sure to arise in the future, Herbert A. Leggett,
B13 1310  9    banker-editor of the Phoenix "Arizona Progress", reflects
B13 1320  6    upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish
B13 1330  5    fifties.
B13 1330  6       One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows, which
B13 1340  5    gave him inferiority complexes. Though it was a great
B13 1350  5    relief when the big brains on these shows turned out
B13 1360  1    to be frauds and phonies, it did irreparable damage
B13 1360 10    to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent,
B13 1370  6    well-informed American.
B13 1380  1       But the one that upset the financially wise was
B13 1380 10    the professional dancer who related in a book how he
B13 1390  8    parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000 profit on the
B13 1400  4    stock market. Every man who dabbles in the market to
B13 1410  1    make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses
B13 1410 12    could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering
B13 1420  8    how her husband could be so dumb. Investors breathed
B13 1430  4    more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic
B13 1440  1    dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best
B13 1440 11    seller book to make some dough.
B13 1450  5       People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner
B13 1460  3    who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the
B13 1460 12    form of a number of bull's-eye achievements. The promoter
B13 1470 10    who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him
B13 1480 10    how he was able to do it. His answer was simple but
B13 1490  5    honest. He just shot at the board and then drew circles
B13 1500  2    around the holes to form a bull's-eye.
B13 1510  1       One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old
B13 1510 14    child is a lack of verbal communication. The child
B13 1520  9    understands no. He senses his mother's disapproval.
B13 1530  4    But explanations leave him confused and unmoved.
B13 1540  2       If his mother loves him, he clings to that love
B13 1540 12    as a ballast. It motivates his behavior. He wants Mommy
B13 1550 10    to think him a good boy. He doesn't want her to look
B13 1560 10    frowningly at him, or speak to him angrily. This breaks
B13 1570  6    his heart. He wants to be called sweet, good, considerate
B13 1580  3    and mother's little helper. But even mother's loving
B13 1590  2    attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.
B13 1590  8       His desires are so strong that he needs constant
B13 1600  8    reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she
B13 1610  7    expects of him, in order to overcome them. His own
B13 1620  3    inner voice, which should tell him what not to do,
B13 1620 13    has not developed. It won't develop until he has words
B13 1630  8    with which to clothe it. The conscience is non-existent
B13 1640  6    in the 2-year-old.
B13 1640 11       What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior?
B13 1650  8    She can decrease the number of temptations. She can
B13 1660  5    remove all knick-knacks within reach. The fewer nos
B13 1670  3    she has to utter the more effective they will be.
B13 1680  1       She should offer substitutes for the temptations
B13 1680  7    which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child. If
B13 1690  6    he can't play with Mommy's magazines, he should have
B13 1700  4    some old numbers of his own. If Daddy's books are out
B13 1710  3    of bounds his own picture books are not. Toys he has
B13 1710 14    can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations
B13 1720  9    such as refrigerator and gas stove.
B13 1730  4       During this precarious period of development the
B13 1740  1    mother should continue to influence the growth of the
B13 1740 10    child's conscience. She tells him of the consequences
B13 1750  7    of his behavior. If he bites a playmate she says, "Danny
B13 1760  6    won't like you". If he snatches a toy, she says, "Caroline
B13 1770  6    wants her own truck just as you do".
B13 1780  1       There is no use trying to "Explain" to a 2-year-old.
B13 1780 13    Actions speak louder. Remove temptations. Remove the
B13 1790  7    child from the scene of his misbehavior. Substitute
B13 1800  5    approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling
B13 1810  4    him how he is to act. He won't submit to his natural
B13 1820  1    desires all the time, and it's Mother's love that is
B13 1820 11    responsible for his good behavior.
