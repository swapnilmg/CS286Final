A28 0010  1    _ELBURN, ILL._
A28 0010  3       - Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in
A28 0020  2    a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales:
A28 0020 13    "We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have
A28 0030 10    good prospects for 10 more. We sold only four pickers
A28 0040  8    all last year".
A28 0040 11       Gus Ehlers, competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm
A28 0050  8    community, says his business since August 1 is running
A28 0060  6    50% above a year earlier. "Before then, my sales during
A28 0070  5    much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%", he
A28 0080  2    says.
A28 0080  3       Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing
A28 0090  2    are above average for their business, farm equipment
A28 0090 10    sales are climbing in most rural areas. Paradoxically,
A28 0100  8    the sales rise is due in large measure to Government
A28 0120  4    efforts to slash farm output. Although the Administration's
A28 0130  3    program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since
A28 0140  2    1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and
A28 0140 11    good weather, are getting such high yields per acre
A28 0150  8    that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines.
A28 0160  6    Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are
A28 0170  5    so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently.
A28 0190  1    The higher price supports provided by the new legislation,
A28 0200  1    together with rising prices for farm products, are
A28 0200  9    pushing up farm income, making it possible for farmers
A28 0210  6    to afford the new machinery.
A28 0220  1       Seven of the eight companies that turn out full
A28 0220 10    lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers
A28 0230  6    since the start of August have shown gains averaging
A28 0240  3    nearly 10% above last year. "In August our dealers
A28 0250  1    sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and
A28 0250 11    in September retail sales were 14% higher than last
A28 0260  8    year", says Mark V. Keeler, farm equipment vice president
A28 0270  6    of International Harvester Co. For the year to date,
A28 0280  7    sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still
A28 0290  3    lag about 5% behind 1960.
A28 0290  8    #TWO OF THREE REPORT GAINS#
A28 0300  1    Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score
A28 0300  9    of states, two out of three report their sales since
A28 0310  9    August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier, with
A28 0320  6    the increases ranging from 5% to 50%. Not all sections
A28 0330  4    are showing an upswing, however; the drought-seared
A28 0340  1    North Central states are the most notable exceptions
A28 0340  9    to the uptrend.
A28 0350  1       The significance of the pickup in farm machinery
A28 0350  9    sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry. The
A28 0360  7    demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick
A28 0370  6    of rural buying generally. Farmers spend more of their
A28 0380  4    income on tractors and implements than on any other
A28 0380 13    group of products. More than 20 million people live
A28 0390  9    on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks,
A28 0400  7    buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide
A28 0410  4    a major market for home appliances, chemicals and other
A28 0420  2    products.
A28 0420  3       Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're
A28 0430  2    haggling less over prices than they did a year ago,
A28 0430 12    dealers report.
A28 0440  2       "Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year
A28 0440 10    so we can get more money on a sale", says Jack Martin,
A28 0450 12    who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux
A28 0460  8    City, Iowa. "This morning, we allowed a farmer $600
A28 0470  7    on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model.
A28 0480  5    Last year, we probably would have given him $700 for
A28 0490  2    a comparable machine". Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors
A28 0490 10    in August; in August of 1960, he sold seven.
A28 0500  8    #DEALERS' STOCKS DOWN#
A28 0510  1    With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about
A28 0510  9    25% below a year ago, the affects of the rural recovery
A28 0520  8    are being felt almost immediately by the country's
A28 0530  4    farm equipment manufacturers. For example, farm equipment
A28 0540  2    shipments of International Harvester in August climbed
A28 0550  1    about 5% above a year earlier, Mr. Keeler reports.
A28 0550 10       Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson, Ltd., of
A28 0560  7    Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from
A28 0570  7    869 in the like period a year earlier, says John Staiger,
A28 0580  4    vice president.
A28 0580  6       With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up
A28 0590  6    demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages
A28 0600  4    of some implements. Merritt D. Hill, Ford Motor Co.
A28 0610  2    vice president, says his company is starting to get
A28 0610 11    calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery
A28 0620  7    or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn
A28 0630  6    pickers.
A28 0630  7       Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961,
A28 0640  7    retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier
A28 0650  3    levels since the latter part of 1959. The rise in sales
A28 0660  1    last winter was checked when the Government's new feed
A28 0660 10    grain program was adopted; the program resulted in
A28 0670  7    a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and, as
A28 0690  5    a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.
A28 0700  1       Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and
A28 0700  9    dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly
A28 0710  9    from the recent improvement in crop prospects. Total
A28 0720  5    farm output for this year is officially forecast at
A28 0730  3    129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than
A28 0740  1    the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final
A28 0740 11    figure for 1960.
A28 0750  1       The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects.
A28 0750  9    Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government
A28 0760  6    this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special
A28 0770  7    subsidies and incentive payments, well above the record
A28 0780  5    $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million
A28 0790  2    of 1960. Price support loans may total another $1 billion
A28 0800  1    this year. With cash receipts from marketings expected
A28 0800  9    to be slightly above 1960, farmers' gross income is
A28 0810  7    estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5 billion above 1960's
A28 0820  4    record high. Net income may reach $12.7 billion, up
A28 0830  2    $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953. The
A28 0830 12    Government reported last week that the index of prices
A28 0840  9    received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September
A28 0850  9    for the third consecutive month, reaching 242% of the
A28 0860  5    1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July.
A28 0880  1       KENNEDY OPPOSES any widespread relief from a High
A28 0880  9    Court depletion ruling.
A28 0890  3       The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the
A28 0900  4    case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which
A28 0900 14    it mined. The company, in figuring its taxable earnings,
A28 0910  9    deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for
A28 0920  7    its finished products. Such "depletion allowances",
A28 0930  2    in the form of percentages of sales are authorized
A28 0940  1    by tax law for specified raw materials producers using
A28 0940 10    up their assets. The High Court held that the company
A28 0950  9    must apply its percentage allowance to the value of
A28 0960  6    the raw materials removed from the ground, not to the
A28 0970  4    revenue from finished products.
A28 0970  8       A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning
A28 0980  6    softened the ruling's impact, on prior-year returns
A28 0990  4    still under review, for clay-mining companies that
A28 1000  1    make brick and tile products. The measure allows such
A28 1000 10    companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion
A28 1010  8    allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products
A28 1020  6    rather than the lower value of raw clay alone.
A28 1030  2       President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure
A28 1040  1    into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception.
A28 1040 10    "My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing
A28 1050  9    a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation
A28 1060  4    for other mineral industries", the President said.

A28 1100  2    the recipient organization showing the date, purpose,

A28 1110  8    for substantiation, the Service indicated, can be especially
A28 1120  7    expected in cases where it suspects the donor received
A28 1130  6    some material benefit in return, such as tickets to
A28 1140  4    a show.
A28 1140  6       In such instance, revenuers stressed, the deduction
A28 1150  3    must be reduced by the value of the benefit received.

A28 1160  1    A RULE on the Federal deductibility of state taxes
A28 1170  1    is contested.
A28 1170  3       A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax under
A28 1180  2    Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property
A28 1180 12    disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation. Louisiana,
A28 1190 10    however, collected an income tax on the profits from
A28 1200  8    the sale. The corporation, in filing its final Federal
A28 1210  4    income return, claimed the state tax payment as a deductible
A28 1220  2    expense, as permitted under U.S. tax law.
A28 1220  9       The Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking
A28 1230  7    a law provision that generally bars deductions for
A28 1240  2    expenses incurred in connection with what it said was
A28 1250  4    tax-exempt income. The Tax Court rejected this view.
A28 1260  1    It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed
A28 1260 13    not from the exempt status of the income but from a
A28 1270  9    special rule on corporate liquidations.
A28 1280  1       The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding
A28 1290  1    by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a
A28 1290 10    year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject. The Service

A28 1370 12    "kicked back" to the company's advertising manager,
A28 1380  7    the Tax Court ruled. The taxpayer testified that in
A28 1390  6    order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices
A28 1400  5    and pay the excess to the manager. The Court upheld
A28 1410  1    the taxpayer's contention that these "kickbacks" were
A28 1410  8    not his income though they passed through his hands.
A28 1420  8    The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved,

A28 1510  1       A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls,
A28 1520  1    for example, may be entitled to distributions under
A28 1520  9    the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social

A28 1540  6    when received, of course, but the company's contributions
A28 1550  2    would be tax-free.
A28 1550  6       A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement,
A28 1560  4    experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more than
A28 1570  2    her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount
A28 1570 13    for her as retirement income. In that event, they note,
A28 1580  9    the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan
A28 1590  6    is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under

A28 1600  4       Possible upshots: The company could be denied a
A28 1610  4    deduction for its pension payments, or those payments
A28 1610 12    for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable

A28 1700  9    The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales.
A28 1710  8    The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales

A28 1740  1    _WASHINGTON_
A28 1740  1       - Consumer spending edged down in April after rising
A28 1750  1    for two consecutive months, the Government reported.
A28 1750  8       The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted
A28 1760  5    sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18
A28 1770  5    billion in April, down 1% from the March level of more
A28 1780  4    than $18.2 billion. April sales also were 5% below
A28 1790  1    those of April last year, when volume reached a record
A28 1790 11    for any month, $18.9 billion (see chart on Page One).
A28 1800  8       The seasonal adjustment takes into account such
A28 1810  5    factors as Easter was on April 2 this year, two weeks
A28 1820  4    earlier than in 1960, and pre-Easter buying was pushed
A28 1830  1    into March.
A28 1830  3       Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain
A28 1840  2    the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge
A28 1840 12    of consumer buying in March. Adjusted sales that month
A28 1850  8    were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month
A28 1860  8    before, which in turn were slightly higher than the
A28 1870  4    January low of $17.8 billion.
