C07 0010  1       SOME of the New York Philharmonic musicians who
C07 0010  9    live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging
C07 0020  7    themselves free from snow. A tiny handful never did
C07 0030  6    make the concert. But, after a fifteen-minute delay,
C07 0040  2    the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on
C07 0040  8    stage for the afternoon's proceedings. They faced a
C07 0050  8    rather small audience, as quite a few subscribers apparently
C07 0060  7    had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon.
C07 0070  4       It was an excellent concert. Paul Paray, rounding
C07 0080  3    out his current stint with the orchestra, is a solid
C07 0090  1    musician, and the Philharmonic plays for him. Their
C07 0090  9    collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was
C07 0100  6    lucid, intelligent and natural sounding. It was not
C07 0110  4    a heavy, ponderous Beethoven. The music sang nicely,
C07 0120  1    sprinted evenly when necessary, was properly accented
C07 0120  8    and balanced.
C07 0130  1    #@#
C07 0130  2       The Franck symphonic poem, "Psyche", is a lush,
C07 0150  1    sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter
C07 0150  9    once again. Fortunate for the music itself, it is not
C07 0160  8    too frequent a visitor; if it were, its heavily chromatic
C07 0170  6    harmonies would soon become cloying.
C07 0180  1       Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize
C07 0180  9    the melodic elements of the score. He did not let the
C07 0190 10    strings, for instance, weep, whine or get hysterical.
C07 0200  6    His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy.
C07 0210  3       And in the Prokofieff C major Piano Concerto, with
C07 0220  3    Zadel Skolovsky as soloist, he was an admirable partner.
C07 0230  1    Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold,
C07 0230  9    sweeping and tonally percussive. He swept through the
C07 0240  8    music with ease, in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient
C07 0250  6    manner.
C07 0250  7    #@#
C07 0250  8    An impressive technician, Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm,
C07 0260  6    to boot. His tone is the weakest part of his equipment;
C07 0270  6    it tends to be hard and colorless. A school of thought
C07 0280  5    has it that those attributes are exactly what this
C07 0290  1    concerto needs. It is, after all, a non-romantic work
C07 0290 11    (even with the big, juicy melody of the second movement);
C07 0300  8    and the composer himself was called the "age of steel
C07 0310  7    pianist". But granted all this, one still would have
C07 0320  4    liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than
C07 0330  1    Mr. Skolovsky supplied.
C07 0330  4       Taken as a whole, though, it was a strong performance
C07 0340  4    from both pianist and orchestra. Mr. Skolovsky fully
C07 0350  2    deserved the warm reception he received.
C07 0350  8       A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's
C07 0360  6    "Festival Overture", receiving its first New York hearing.
C07 0370  7    This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile
C07 0380  6    industry. It is not program music, though. It runs
C07 0390  3    a little more than ten minutes, is workmanlike, busy,
C07 0390 12    methodical and featureless.
C07 0410  1       "La Gioconda", like it or not, is a singer's opera.
C07 0410 11    And so, of course, it is a fan's opera as well. Snow
C07 0420 12    or no, the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan
C07 0430  8    Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli
C07 0440  4    work.
C07 0440  5       So the plot creaks, the sets are decaying, the costumes
C07 0450  5    are pre-historic, the orchestra was sloppy and not
C07 0460  3    very well connected with what the singers were doing.
C07 0460 12    After all, the opera has juicy music to sing and the
C07 0470 11    goodies are well distributed, with no less than six
C07 0480  6    leading parts.
C07 0480  8       One of those parts is that of evil, evil Barnaba,
C07 0490  7    the spy. His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo
C07 0500  4    Colzani, who was taking the part for the first time
C07 0510  1    with the company.
C07 0510  4       He has the temperament and the stage presence for
C07 0520  2    a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong
C07 0520 12    tone. What was lacking was a real sense of phrase,
C07 0530 10    the kind of legato singing that would have added a
C07 0540  6    dimension of smoothness to what is, after all, a very
C07 0550  4    oily character.
C07 0550  6       Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise
C07 0560  4    also were new to the cast, but only with respect to
C07 0570  2    this season; they have both sung these parts here before.
C07 0570 12    Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik, and she gave
C07 0580 11    it force, dramatic color and passion.
C07 0590  3       Mr. Siepi was, as always, a consummate actor; with
C07 0600  2    a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently.
C07 0610  1    Part of this characterization was, of course, accomplished
C07 0610  9    with the vocal chords. His singing was strong and musical;
C07 0620  9    unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often
C07 0630  8    spread in quality.
C07 0630 11       Eileen Farrell in the title role, Mignon Dunn as
C07 0640  8    La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers
C07 0650  5    from earlier performances this season, and all contributed
C07 0660  3    to a vigorous performance. If only they and Fausto
C07 0670  1    Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more. @
C07 0680  1       "MELODIOUS birds sing madrigals" saith the poet
C07 0680  8    and no better description of the madrigaling of the
C07 0690  8    Deller Consort could be imagined.
C07 0700  3       Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces (BG
C07 0710  2    609; stereo BGS 5031) is a good sample of the special,
C07 0720  1    elegant art of English madrigal singing. It also makes
C07 0720 10    a fine introduction to the international art form with
C07 0730  7    good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus
C07 0740  5    several French "chansons".
C07 0750  1       The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal
C07 0750 10    tradition better than anyone else. The original impulses
C07 0760  7    came to England late (in the sixteenth century) and
C07 0770  4    continue strong long after everyone else had gone on
C07 0780  3    to the baroque basso continuo, sonatas, operas and
C07 0780 11    the like.
C07 0790  1       Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened
C07 0790  7    by the Cromwellian interregnum, the practice of singing
C07 0800  6    together- choruses, catches and glees- always flourished.
C07 0810  5    The English never again developed a strong native music
C07 0820  5    that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great
C07 0830  2    age the way, say, the opera in Italy blotted out the
C07 0830 13    Italian madrigal.
C07 0840  2    #EARLY INTEREST#
C07 0840  4    Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well
C07 0850  3    back into the nineteenth century in England, much ahead
C07 0860  1    of similar revivals in other countries. As a result
C07 0860 10    no comparable literature of the period is better known
C07 0870  8    and better studied nor more often performed than the
C07 0880  5    English madrigal.
C07 0880  7       Naturally, Mr. Deller and the other singers in his
C07 0890  8    troupe are most charming and elegant when they are
C07 0900  4    squarely in their tradition and singing music by their
C07 0910  1    countrymen: William Byrd, Thomas Morley and Thomas
C07 0910  8    Tomkins. There is an almost instrumental quality to
C07 0920  8    their singing, with a tendency to lift out important
C07 0930  5    lines and make them lead the musical texture. Both
C07 0940  2    techniques give the music purity and clarity.
C07 0940  9       Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle
C07 0950  7    (the French equivalents of tarantara, rum-tum-tum,
C07 0960  6    and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque) is lots of
C07 0970  3    fun, and the singers get a sense of grace and shape
C07 0970 14    into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus. Only with
C07 0980  8    the more sensual, intense and baroque expressions of
C07 0990  5    Marenzio, Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing
C07 1000  4    seem a little superficial.
C07 1000  8       Nevertheless, the musicality, accuracy and infectious
C07 1010  5    charm of these performances, excellently reproduced,
C07 1020  2    make it an attractive look-see at the period. The works
C07 1030  2    are presented chronologically. Texts and translations
C07 1030  8    are provided.
C07 1040  1    #ELEGANCE AND COLOR#
C07 1040  4    The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are
C07 1050  2    strong French characteristics. Baroque instrumental
C07 1050  7    music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong, lively,
C07 1060 10    intense, controlled and quite abstract. In France,
C07 1070  6    it remained always more picturesque, more dancelike,
C07 1080  3    more full of flavor.
C07 1080  7       Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything
C07 1090  6    they wrote, not in the later sense of "program music"
C07 1100  4    but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close,
C07 1110  1    clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise
C07 1110 10    utterance.
C07 1120  1       Both composers turn up on new imports from France.
C07 1120 10    BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company
C07 1130 10    whose full label is Editions de la boite a musique.
C07 1140  7    They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French
C07 1150  5    music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention.
C07 1160  1    Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin le grand occupy
C07 1170  1    two disks (LD056 and LD060) and reveal the impeccable
C07 1170 10    taste and workmanship of this master- delicate, flexible
C07 1180  8    and gemlike.
C07 1190  1       The Concerts- Nos. 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 are represented-
C07 1200  1    are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos
C07 1200 10    in the Italian sense. The sonatas, "La Francaise",
C07 1210  6    "La Sultane", "L'Astree" and "L'Imperiale", are often
C07 1220  5    more elaborately worked out and, in fact, show a strong
C07 1230  8    Italian influence.
C07 1230 10       Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known
C07 1240  9    contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise du
C07 1250  5    XVIIIe Siecle (BAM LD 060). Jean-Marie LeClair still
C07 1260  6    is remembered a bit, but Bodin de Beismortier, Corrette
C07 1270  3    and Mondonville are hardly household words. What is
C07 1280  3    interesting about these chamber works here is how they
C07 1280 12    all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving
C07 1290  9    toward the rococo.
C07 1300  1       The Couperin "La Steinkerque", with its battle music,
C07 1300  9    brevity, wit and refined simplicity, already shakes
C07 1310  7    off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances
C07 1320  6    that ended the baroque era. If Couperin shows the fashionable
C07 1330  5    trend, the others do so all the more.
C07 1340  1       All these records have close, attractive sound and
C07 1340  9    the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is
C07 1350  7    characteristic.
C07 1350  8       Rameau's Six Concerts en Sextuor, recorded by L'orchestre
C07 1360  8    de chambre Pierre Menet (BAM LD 046), turn out to
C07 1370 10    be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently
C07 1380  6    by the composer himself. The strange, delightful little
C07 1390  5    character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable
C07 1400  2    titles are still evocative and gracious.
C07 1410  1       Maitres Allemands des XVIIe et XVIIIe Siecles contains
C07 1410  8    music by Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Rosenmueller and Telemann,
C07 1420  7    well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie
C07 1430  6    Spycket (BAM LD 035).
C07 1450  1       Rococo music- a lot of it- was played in Carnegie
C07 1450 11    Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four
C07 1460 10    concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization
C07 1470  7    known as Globe Concert Arts.
C07 1480  1       Works by J. C. Bach, Anton Craft, Joseph Haydn,
C07 1480 10    Giuseppe Sammartini, Comenico Dragonetti and J. G.
C07 1490  7    Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including
C07 1500  6    Anabel Brieff, flutist, Josef Marx, oboist, and Robert
C07 1510  6    Conant, pianist and harpsichordist.
C07 1520  1       Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant
C07 1520 10    above all, it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century
C07 1530  9    ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances
C07 1540  7    of composers from Beethoven to Boulez.
C07 1550  3       Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century
C07 1560  1    charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed
C07 1560 10    another on Saturday night. Each might find a useful
C07 1570  7    place in a varied musical program, but taken together
C07 1580  4    they grew quite tiresome.
C07 1580  8       The performances were variable, those of the full
C07 1590  7    ensemble being generally satisfying, some by soloists
C07 1600  4    proving rather trying. @
C07 1610  1       Ellie Mao, soprano, and Frederick Fuller, baritone,
C07 1610  8    presented a program of folksongs entitled "East Meets
C07 1620  8    West" in Carnegie Recital Hall last night. They were
C07 1630  7    accompanied by Anna Mi Lee, pianist.
C07 1640  2       Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos
C07 1650  1    and duets in a broad range of languages. Songs from
C07 1650 11    China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss
C07 1660  6    Mao, who is a native of China, and those of the British
C07 1670  6    Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller, who is English by birth.
C07 1680  4       This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic
C07 1690  2    folk styles. On the contrary, Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller
C07 1700  1    chose many of their arrangements from the works of
C07 1700 10    composers such as Mendelssohn, Dvorak, Canteloube,
C07 1710  5    Copland and Britten. Thre was, therefore, more musical
C07 1730  4    substance in the concert than might have been the case
C07 1740  3    otherwise. The performances were assured, communicative
C07 1740  9    and pleasingly informal. @
C07 1760  1       WHAT was omitted from "A Neglected Education" were
C07 1770  1    those essentials known as "the facts of life".
C07 1770  9       Chabrier's little one-act operetta, presented yesterday
C07 1780  7    afternoon at Town Hall, is a fragile, precious little
C07 1790  6    piece, very French, not without wit and charm. The
C07 1800  4    poor uneducated newlywed, a certain Gontran de Boismassif,
C07 1810  1    has his problems in getting the necessary information.
C07 1810  9    The humor of the situation can be imagined.
C07 1820  7       It all takes place in the eighteenth century. What
C07 1830  4    a silly, artificial way of life, Chabrier and his librettists
C07 1840  4    chuckle. But they wish they could bring it back.
C07 1850  1    #@#
C07 1850  2    Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point
C07 1850 10    where the classical, rationalist tradition, (handed
C07 1860  6    down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and
C07 1870  7    salon music) becomes virtually neo-classicism. The
C07 1880  2    musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of
C07 1880 11    taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming
C07 1890 10    either bawdy or mawkish.
C07 1900  2       The simple, clever production was also able to tread
C07 1910  1    the thin line between those extremes. Arlene Saunders
C07 1910  9    was charming as poor Gontran. Yes, Arlene is her name;
C07 1920  8    the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition
C07 1930  2    of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to
C07 1940  3    a soprano. Benita Valente was delightful as the young
C07 1940 12    wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who
C07 1950 10    failed to do all his tutoring.
C07 1960  1       The work was presented as the final event in the
C07 1960 11    Town Hall Festival of Music. It was paired with a Darius
C07 1970 11    Milhaud opera, "The Poor Sailor", set to a libretto
C07 1980  8    by Jean Cocteau, a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea,
C07 1990  8    a sailor returns, unrecognized, and gets done in by
C07 2000  5    his wife.
C07 2000  7       With the exception of a few spots, Milhaud's music
C07 2010  3    mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties,
C07 2020  1    odd harmonies, and lumbering, satiric orchestration.
