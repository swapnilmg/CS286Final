J33 0010  1    In sentences, patterns of stress are determined by
J33 0010  9    complex combinations of influences that can only be
J33 0020  7    suggested here. The tendency is toward putting dominant
J33 0030  3    stress at the end. There is a parallel to this tendency
J33 0040  1    in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes.
J33 0040 11    Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns
J33 0050  9    are as follows. "A charge to keep I have, A God to
J33 0060 10    glorify". In the tune to which this hymn is most often
J33 0070  9    sung, "Boylston", the syllables have and fy, ending
J33 0080  5    their lines, have twice the time any other syllables
J33 0090  3    have. Dominant stress is of course more than extended
J33 0100  1    duration, and normally centers on syllables that would
J33 0100  9    have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or
J33 0110  8    longer units they are parts of were spoken alone: a
J33 0120  5    dominant stress given to glorify would normally center
J33 0130  2    on its first syllable rather than its last. But the
J33 0130 12    parallel is significant. When the answer to what's
J33 0140  8    wrong now? is Bill's broken a chair, dominant stress
J33 0150  6    will usually be on the complement a chair. From the
J33 0160  5    point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in
J33 0170  4    the statement is the predicator has broken, and from
J33 0180  1    the point of view of meaning it would seem that the
J33 0180 12    trouble centers in the breaking; but dominant stress
J33 0190  7    will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional
J33 0200  5    versions of the sentence. In I know one thing dominant
J33 0210  3    stress will usually be on the complement one thing;
J33 0220  1    in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator
J33 0220 13    know. In small-town people are very friendly dominant
J33 0230  9    stress will generally be on the complement very friendly;
J33 0240  8    in the double sentence the smaller the town, the friendlier
J33 0250  7    the people it will generally be on the subjects the
J33 0260  6    town and the people. In what's a linguist? dominant
J33 0270  4    stress will generally be on the subject a linguist;
J33 0280  3    in who's a linguist? it will generally be on the complement
J33 0290  3    a linguist. Dominant stress is on her luggage both
J33 0300  2    in that's her luggage, where her luggage is the complement,
J33 0310  1    and in there's her luggage, where it is the subject.
J33 0310 11    Adverbial second complements, however, are likely not
J33 0320  7    to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences.
J33 0330  5    If the answer to what was that noise? is George put
J33 0340  4    the cat out, dominant stress will ordinarily be on
J33 0350  3    the first complement, the cat, not the second complement
J33 0360  1    out. Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress.
J33 0360 11    If the answer to what was that noise? is George reads
J33 0370 10    the news emotionally, dominant stress may or may not
J33 0380  7    be on the adjunct emotionally. When prepositional complements
J33 0390  4    are divided as in what are you looking for? they are
J33 0400  5    likely to lose dominant stress.
J33 0400 10       Context is of extreme importance. What is new in
J33 0410  9    the context is likely to be made more prominent than
J33 0420  7    what is not. Thus in a context in which there has been
J33 0430  4    discussion of snow but mention of local conditions
J33 0430 12    is new, dominant stress will probably be on here in
J33 0440 10    it rarely snows here, but in a context in which there
J33 0450  9    has been discussion of local weather but no mention
J33 0460  5    of snow, dominant stress will probably be on snows.
J33 0470  1    The personal pronouns and substitute one are normally
J33 0470  9    unstressed because they refer to what is prominent
J33 0480  8    in the immediate context. In I'll go with George dominant
J33 0490  7    stress is probably on George; but if George has just
J33 0500  6    been mentioned prominently (and the trip to be made
J33 0510  6    has been under discussion), what is said is probably
J33 0520  1    I'll go with him, and dominant stress is probably on
J33 0520 11    the preposition with. When a gesture accompanies who's
J33 0530  7    he? the personal pronoun has dominant stress because
J33 0540  6    "he" has not been mentioned previously. If both George
J33 0550  5    and a piece of information George does not have are
J33 0560  5    prominent in the context, but the idea of telling George
J33 0570  1    is new, then dominant stress will probably be on tell
J33 0570 11    in why not tell George? But when what is new in a particular
J33 0580 12    context is also fairly obvious, there is normally only
J33 0590  9    light stress or no stress at all. Thus the unstressed
J33 0600  6    it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from
J33 0610  4    its use with snows: nothing can snow snow but "it".
J33 0620  3    In there aren't many young people in the neighborhood
J33 0630  1    the modifier young takes dominant stress away from
J33 0630  9    its head people: the fact that the young creatures
J33 0640  8    of interest are people seems rather obvious. If women
J33 0650  6    replaced people, it would normally have dominant stress.
J33 0660  4    In I have things to do the word things makes little
J33 0670  3    real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress
J33 0680  1    than do. If work is substituted for things (with more
J33 0690  1    exact contribution to meaning), it will have dominant
J33 0690  9    stress. In I know one thing dominant stress is likely
J33 0700  8    to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing.
J33 0710  5    In I knew you when you were a child, and you were pretty
J33 0720  5    then dominant stress on then implies that the young
J33 0730  3    woman spoken to is still pretty. Dominant stress on
J33 0730 12    pretty would be almost insulting here. In the written
J33 0740  9    language then can be underlined or italicized to guide
J33 0750  8    the reader here, but much of the time the written language
J33 0760  7    simply depends on the reader's alertness, and a careless
J33 0770  4    reader will have to back up and reread.
J33 0780  1       Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering
J33 0780  8    of attention or emotion. Thus in it's incredible what
J33 0790  6    that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on
J33 0800  6    incredible, and eat will have strong stress also. In
J33 0810  4    she has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily
J33 0820  1    be on in, where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems
J33 0820 12    to center. In we're painting at our garage strong stress
J33 0830 10    on at indicates that the job being done is not real
J33 0840 10    painting but simply an effort at painting. Where there
J33 0850  6    is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally
J33 0860  3    operate to center attention. Thus in his friends are
J33 0870  2    stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal
J33 0870 10    for his and sisters', but in his friends are stranger
J33 0880  9    than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends
J33 0890  7    and sisters. In he's hurting himself more than he's
J33 0900  7    hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress
J33 0910  6    than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast.
J33 0920  5    In is she Chinese or Japanese? the desire to contrast
J33 0930  4    the first parts of words which are alike in their last
J33 0940  1    components produces an exceptional disregard of the
J33 0940  8    normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese.
J33 0950  7    Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important
J33 0960  6    secondary relationship. Thus in Mary wrote an account
J33 0970  4    of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary
J33 0980  2    as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts
J33 0980 13    of the trip, strong stress on wrote marks the writing
J33 0990  8    as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned
J33 1000  6    with an account of her trip (about which she may later
J33 1010  5    have made speeches, for example), and strong stress
J33 1020  1    on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects
J33 1020 13    about which Mary wrote accounts. In hunger stimulates
J33 1030  8    man too the situation is very similar. Strong stress
J33 1040  6    on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus,
J33 1050  4    strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an
J33 1060  3    additional effect of hunger, strong stress on man treats
J33 1070  1    man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation
J33 1070 11    of hunger. Here again, in the written language it is
J33 1080  9    possible to help the reader get his stresses right
J33 1090  6    by using underlining or italics, but much of the time
J33 1100  4    there is simply reliance on his understanding in the
J33 1100 13    light of context.
J33 1110  3       When a word represents a larger construction of
J33 1120  1    which it is the only expressed part, it normally has
J33 1120 11    more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction.
J33 1130  8    Thus when yes, I have is the response to have you finished
J33 1140  9    reading the paper? the stress on have, which here represents
J33 1150  8    have finished reading the paper, is quite strong. In
J33 1160  7    Mack's the leader at camp, but Jack is here the is
J33 1170  6    of the second main declarative represents is the leader
J33 1180  4    and therefore has stress. Mack's the leader at camp,
J33 1190  2    but Jack's here, with this is deprived of stress, makes
J33 1200  1    here the complement in the clause. In of all the suggestions
J33 1200 12    that were made, his was the silliest the possessive
J33 1210  9    his represents his suggestion and is stressed. When
J33 1220  7    go represents itself and a complement (being equivalent,
J33 1230  5    say, to go to Martinique) in which boat did Jack go
J33 1240  5    on? it has strong stress; when it represents only itself
J33 1250  3    and on which is its complement (so that go on is semantically
J33 1260  3    equivalent to board), on has stronger stress than go
J33 1270  3    does. Omission of a subordinator pronoun, however,
J33 1270 10    does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional
J33 1280 11    adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be
J33 1290  6    object. Thus to has light stress both in that was the
J33 1300  6    conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion
J33 1310  4    I came to. But when to represents to consciousness
J33 1320  1    in that was the moment that I came to, and similarly
J33 1340  1    in that was the moment I came to, there is much stronger
J33 1340 13    stress on to. In I wanted to tell him, but I was afraid
J33 1350 13    to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents
J33 1360  8    to tell him. In to tell him, of course, to is normally
J33 1370  9    unstressed. When I have instructions to leave is equivalent
J33 1371  7    in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave
J33 1380  8    this place, dominant stress is ordinarily on leave.
J33 1390  5    When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to
J33 1400  3    I have instructions which I am to leave, dominant stress
J33 1410  1    is ordinarily on instructions.
J33 1410  5       It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show
J33 1420  2    construction unambiguously in the spoken language where
J33 1430  1    without the help of context it would be ambiguous in
J33 1430 11    the written. Other examples follow. "I'll come by Tuesday.
J33 1440  8    I can't be happy long without drinking water". In the
J33 1450 10    first of these sentences if by is the complement of
J33 1460  8    come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to
J33 1470  7    on Tuesday, there will be strong stress on by in the
J33 1480  6    spoken language; but if a complement for come is implied
J33 1490  4    and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct,
J33 1500  3    by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most.
J33 1500 12    In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial
J33 1510 10    clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent
J33 1520  7    in meaning to unless I drink water, there will be stronger
J33 1530  8    stress on water than on drinking; but if drinking is
J33 1540  6    a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking
J33 1550  4    water is equivalent to without water for drinking,
J33 1560  3    there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water.
J33 1570  2    But the use of stress in comparison and contrast, for
J33 1570 12    example, can undermine distinctions such as these.
J33 1580  7    And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by
J33 1590  6    any means. In the Steiners have busy lives without
J33 1600  3    visiting relatives only context can indicate whether
J33 1600 10    visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying
J33 1610  8    visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting
J33 1620  7    them, and in I looked up the number and I looked up
J33 1630  8    the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney
J33 1640  5    make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement
J33 1650  4    in the first sentence and a preposition followed by
J33 1660  2    its object in the second.
J33 1660  7    #SYLLABIFICATION.#
J33 1660  8    - Syllables are linguistic units centering in peaks
J33 1670  6    which are usually vocalic but, as has been noted, are
J33 1680  5    consonantal under certain circumstances, and which
J33 1690  1    may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following
J33 1690 11    consonants or combinations of consonants. Syllables
J33 1700  6    are genuine units, but division of words and sentences
J33 1710  5    into them presents great difficulties. Sometimes even
J33 1720  2    the number of syllables is not clear. Doubt on this
J33 1720 12    point is strongest before /l/ and /@/ or /r/. From
J33 1730 10    the point of view of word formation real might be expected
J33 1740  7    to have two syllables. Historically re is the formative
J33 1750  5    that is employed also in republic, and al is the common
J33 1760  6    suffix. When ity is added, real clearly has two syllables.
J33 1770  6    But there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable,
J33 1780  5    and because of the fact that /l/ commonly has the quality
J33 1790  4    of /@/ when it follows vowel sounds, deal seems to
J33 1800  2    be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real.
