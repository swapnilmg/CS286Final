B17 0010  1    #"WORKERS OF THE PARTY"#
B17 0010  5    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0010  8       Sir- We are writing in reference to a recent "suggestion"
B17 0020  8    made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service
B17 0030  7    of Jersey City (registered professional nurses with
B17 0040  4    college background and varying experiences). The day
B17 0050  3    before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a
B17 0050 13    legal holiday, we were informed to report to our respective
B17 0060  9    polls to work as "workers of the party".
B17 0070  4       Being ethical and professional people interested
B17 0080  2    in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't
B17 0090  1    a function of our position. Such tactics reek of totalitarianism!
B17 0100  1    As we understand, this directive was given to all city
B17 0100 11    and county employes.
B17 0110  1       To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been
B17 0110 11    employed because of political affiliation. We, therefore,
B17 0120  7    considered the "suggestion" an insult to our intelligence,
B17 0130  6    ethics, Bill of Rights, etc. Our only obligation for
B17 0140  6    this day is to vote, free of persuasion, for the person
B17 0150  4    we feel is capable in directing the public.
B17 0160  1       This is our duty- not as nurses or city employes-
B17 0160 11    but as citizens of the United States. @
B17 0170  6    #"PLUS-ONE" SHELTERS#
B17 0180  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0180  2       Sir- I read of a man who felt he should not build
B17 0190  1    a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish
B17 0190 12    for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.
B17 0200  9    Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are
B17 0210  6    free loaders unwilling to help themselves, but ready
B17 0220  3    to demand that "the community" help and protect them?
B17 0230  1       Community shelters are, of course, necessary for
B17 0230  8    those having no space for shelter. If in a town of
B17 0240 10    2,000 private homes, half of them have shelters, the
B17 0250  5    need for the community shelters will be reduced to
B17 0260  2    that extent.
B17 0260  4       In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing
B17 0270  3    to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's
B17 0270 13    occupants, "plus-one"- so he will be able to take in
B17 0280 11    a stranger. I hope the man who plans to sit on his
B17 0290 10    hands until the emergency comes will have a change
B17 0300  5    of heart, will get busy and be the first member of
B17 0310  1    our "plus-one" shelter club. @
B17 0310  7    #ESCAPE#
B17 0320  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0320  1       Sir- People continue to inquire the reason for the
B17 0320  9    race for outer space. It's simple enough from my point
B17 0330  8    of view. I am for it.
B17 0340  1       It is the only method left for a man to escape from
B17 0340 13    a woman's world. @
B17 0350  3    #SUPPORTS KATANGA#
B17 0350  5    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0350  8       Sir- When the colonies decided upon freedom from
B17 0360  7    England, we insisted, through the Declaration of Independence,
B17 0370  5    that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate
B17 0380  5    political entity. It is high time the United States
B17 0390  2    began to realize that the God-given rights of men set
B17 0390 13    forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga.
B17 0400  9       In the United Nations Charter, the right of self-determination
B17 0410  8    is also an essential principle. This, again, applies
B17 0420  5    to Katanga. The people of Katanga had fought for, and
B17 0430  5    obtained, their freedom from the Communist yoke of
B17 0440  3    Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts. By political, economic,
B17 0440 11    geographic and natural standards, they were justified
B17 0450  7    in doing so.
B17 0460  1       The United States and the U.N. denounce their own
B17 0460 10    principles when they defend the Communist oppressors
B17 0470  7    and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination
B17 0480  6    of the Katangans. @
B17 0480 10    #COUNTY COLLEGE COSTS#
B17 0490  3    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0490  6       Sir- Permit me to commend your editorial in which
B17 0500  5    you stress the fact that a program of county colleges
B17 0510  2    will substantially increase local tax burdens and that
B17 0510 10    taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such
B17 0520 11    a program would commit them to.
B17 0530  3       The bill which passed the Assembly last May and
B17 0540  1    is now pending in the Senate should be given careful
B17 0540 11    scrutiny. The procedure for determining the amounts
B17 0550  5    of money to be spent by county colleges and raised
B17 0560  3    by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.
B17 0560 10       Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees
B17 0570 11    of a county college will be appointed; none will be
B17 0580  8    elected. The trustees will prepare an annual budget
B17 0590  6    for the college and submit it to the board of school
B17 0600  3    estimate. This board will consist of two of the trustees
B17 0610  1    of the college, and the director and two members of
B17 0610 11    the board of freeholders. It will determine the amount
B17 0620  6    of money to be spent by the college and will certify
B17 0630  4    this amount to the board of freeholders, which "shall
B17 0640  1    appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations
B17 0640  9    are made by it the amount so certified and the amount
B17 0650 10    shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same
B17 0660  6    manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes".
B17 0670  1       The approval of only three members of the board
B17 0670 10    of school estimate is required to certify the amount
B17 0680  9    of money to be allotted to the college. Since two of
B17 0690  7    these could be trustees of the college, actually it
B17 0700  3    would be necessary to have the consent of only one
B17 0700 13    elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars
B17 0710 10    of tax revenue. This is taxation without representation.

B17 0730  1    #TAXING IMPROVEMENTS#
B17 0730  3    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0730  6       Sir- Your editorial, "Housing Speedup", is certainly
B17 0740  5    not the answer to our slum problems. The very rules
B17 0750  4    and regulations in every city are the primary case
B17 0760  2    of slum conditions.
B17 0760  5       Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged
B17 0770  4    to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.
B17 0780  1    Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum
B17 0780 13    clearance at no cost to taxpayers, will happen. Our
B17 0790  9    entire economy will have a terrific uplift. @
B17 0800  5    #"NATURAL CAUSES"#
B17 0810  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0810  1       Sir- An old man is kicked to death by muggers. The
B17 0810 11    medical examiner states that death was due to "natural
B17 0820  8    causes".
B17 0820  9       I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed
B17 0830 10    by a taxicab in New York, it is listed as "death due
B17 0840  7    to natural causes". @
B17 0840 11    #PRAISES EXHIBIT#
B17 0850  2    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0850  5       Sir- Every resident of this city should visit the
B17 0860  4    Newark Museum and see the exhibit "Our Changing Skyline
B17 0870  2    in Newark". It will be at the museum until March 30.
B17 0880  1       It is a revelation of what has been done, what is
B17 0880 12    being done and what will be done in Newark as shown
B17 0890 10    by architects' plans, models and pictures. It shows
B17 0900  5    what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly
B17 0910  2    make every Newarker proud of this city.
B17 0910  9       It should also make him desire to participate actively
B17 0920  8    in civic, school and religious life of the community
B17 0930  5    so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge
B17 0940  5    presented by this exhibit. @
B17 0940 10    #PARKWAY COURTESY#
B17 0950  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0950  4       Sir- I hasten to join in praise of the men in the
B17 0960  4    toll booths on the Garden State Parkway. Recently I
B17 0960 13    traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and
B17 0970 10    I found the most courteous group of men you will find
B17 0980  8    anywhere. One even gave my little dog a biscuit. It
B17 0990  5    was very refreshing. @
B17 1000  1    #"DEEP PEEP SHOW"#
B17 1000  4    The viewers of the "deep Peep Show" at 15th and M
B17 1010  5    streets nw. have an added attraction- the view of a
B17 1020  3    fossilized cypress swamp. Twenty feet below the street
B17 1020 11    level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed
B17 1030 11    on this site, a black coal-like deposit has been encountered.
B17 1040  7       This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred
B17 1050  7    million years ago cypress-like trees were growing.
B17 1060  3    The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found
B17 1070  1    embedded in the clay. Some of the stumps are as much
B17 1070 12    as three feet long, but most of them have been flattened
B17 1080  9    by the pressure of the overlying sediments. Although
B17 1090  3    the wood has been changed to coal, much of it still
B17 1100  4    retains its original cell structure.
B17 1100  9       In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains
B17 1110  6    and spores which came from plants growing in the region
B17 1120  5    at the time. These microfossils indicate the swamp
B17 1130  2    was "formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when
B17 1130 10    dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering
B17 1140 10    plants were just appearing.
B17 1150  1       The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with
B17 1160  1    the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on
B17 1160  9    17th Street reported in The Washington Post, August
B17 1170  6    2, 1955, which was probably formed during the second
B17 1180  5    interglacial period and is therefore much younger.

B17 1190  2    #WORKING FOR PEACE#
B17 1190  5    Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on
B17 1200  3    National Legislation was interviewed on the air. While
B17 1210  2    I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four
B17 1210 12    points that I would like to question.
B17 1220  7    _1._
B17 1220  8       He said, "Let's work for peace instead of protection
B17 1230  5    from aggression". I would ask, "Why not do both"? Military
B17 1240  5    power does not cause war; war is the result of mistrust
B17 1250  3    and lack of understanding between people. Are we not
B17 1260  1    late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends,
B17 1260 10    in doing enough about this lack of understanding?
B17 1270  6    _2._
B17 1270  7       As to protection, the speaker disapproved of shelters,
B17 1280  6    pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone.
B17 1290  5    Is this a reason for saving no one? Would the man with
B17 1300  4    an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because
B17 1300 14    his boat could not pick up everyone?
B17 1310  7    _3._
B17 1310  8       The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack
B17 1320  8    world would be too awful to face. If the world comes
B17 1330  5    to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage
B17 1340  1    and American know-how would be needed to help survivors
B17 1340 11    rebuild? Many of our young people think it would.
B17 1350  9    _4._
B17 1350 10       Lastly, the speaker decried our organized program
B17 1360  5    of emergency help calling it "Civilian Defense". In
B17 1370  3    1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense (different
B17 1380  2    from Civilian-groups of World War II), a responsibility
B17 1390  1    of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss
B17 1390 11    of life and property in disaster, natural or manmade.
B17 1400  6       Far from creating fear, as the speaker suggests,
B17 1410  5    preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency- gives
B17 1420  4    people confidence. Civil Defense has far to go and
B17 1430  1    many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit
B17 1430 13    of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing, but
B17 1440  8    prepared to care for our own families and help our
B17 1450  4    neighbors in any disaster- storm, flood, accident or
B17 1460  2    even war? @
B17 1460  5    #PETS IN APARTMENTS#
B17 1460  8    It seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments
B17 1470  5    are denied the right of providing themselves with the
B17 1480  3    protection and companionship of dogs. I feel that few
B17 1490  1    burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's
B17 1490 11    apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl
B17 1500 10    that a dog would provide. In addition, would not the
B17 1510  5    young female public of Washington be afforded a greater
B17 1520  3    degree of protection at night when they are on the
B17 1520 13    streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?
B17 1530 11       I grant that the dog may not be really protective,
B17 1540  8    based on his training, but if you were roaming the
B17 1550  4    streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady
B17 1560  1    to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person
B17 1560 12    strolling with a dog? I would like to suggest that
B17 1570  9    the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider
B17 1580  5    liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments.

B17 1590  5    #SIDEWALK CAFES#
B17 1590  7    Use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe?
B17 1600  6    Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal?
B17 1610  4    Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'
B17 1620  1    comfort?
B17 1620  2       Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended.
B17 1630  3    The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak.
B17 1640  1    Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not
B17 1640 13    have to travel too far to eat? Unfortunately the cafes
B17 1650  8    might not make enough money to support themselves during
B17 1660  5    the off season. As an added suggestion to balance the
B17 1670  4    budget, the Government could sell advertising space
B17 1680  1    on the Washington Monument. It is visible throughout
B17 1680  9    the city, and men from Madison ave. would jump at the
B17 1690  9    chance. @
B17 1690 11    #@#
B17 1690 12    Sen. Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul
B17 1700 10    and heart. He, like most of us, wants to be able to
B17 1710  9    sit, to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors.
B17 1720  4    Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas
B17 1730  1    around fountains and gardens. Let us, like the French,
B17 1730 10    have outdoor cafes where we may relax, converse at
B17 1740  8    leisure and enjoy the passing crowd. @

B17 1770  3    and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of
B17 1780  2    the Thirties did not work.
