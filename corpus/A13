A13 0010  1       Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching
A13 0010  8    Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over
A13 0020 10    Indianapolis, 5-3.
A13 0030  1       The husky 6-3, 205-pound lefthander, was in command
A13 0030 11    all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only
A13 0040 10    949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver
A13 0050  5    area.
A13 0050  6       It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the
A13 0060  5    new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to
A13 0070  3    four straight. They now lead Louisville by a full game
A13 0070 13    on top of the American Association pack.
A13 0080  7       Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton
A13 0090  6    in the third inning. He has given only the one pass
A13 0100  5    in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a
A13 0110  1    southpaw.
A13 0110  2       The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as
A13 0120  1    they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.
A13 0120  9       Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles
A13 0130  8    against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack.
A13 0140  6    After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay Cooke walked and
A13 0150  4    Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe. Alusik then moved
A13 0160  2    Cooke across with a line drive to left. Jay Porter
A13 0160 12    drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's
A13 0170 11    smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout.
A13 0180  7       The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe
A13 0190  5    dropped a double into the leftfield corner, Paschal
A13 0200  2    doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled
A13 0200 10    off Phil Shartzer's glove.
A13 0210  3       Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians
A13 0220  4    bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the
A13 0230  1    sixth. Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner,
A13 0230  9    Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder
A13 0240  8    roller accounted for the tallies.
A13 0250  3       The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's
A13 0260  3    double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.
A13 0270  1       Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for
A13 0270 10    the third Indianapolis run in the ninth.
A13 0280  5       Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked
A13 0290  3    off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and
A13 0290 14    some good infield play.
A13 0300  4       Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder
A13 0310  2    in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some
A13 0320  1    good stops and showed a strong arm at third base.
A13 0320 11    #BINGLES AND BOBBLES:#
A13 0330  1    Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight
A13 0340  2    hits ... It was the season's first night game and an
A13 0340 13    obvious refocusing of the lights are in order ... The
A13 0350 10    infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield
A13 0360  5    was much too dark ... Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at
A13 0370  4    the organ ... Among the spectators was the noted exotic
A13 0380  1    dancer, Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off

A13 0400  1    will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris

A13 0410  8    bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting
A13 0420  7    turn.
A13 0430  1    _DALLAS, TEX., MAY 1- (AP)_
A13 0430  6       - Kenny Lane of Muskegon, Mich., world's seventh
A13 0450  4    ranked lightweight, had little trouble in taking a
A13 0460  3    unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler, Tex.,
A13 0460 11    here Monday night.
A13 0480  1    _ST. PAUL-MINNEAPOLIS, MAY 1- (AP)_
A13 0480  7       - Billy Gardner's line double, which just eluded
A13 0490  6    the diving Minnie Minoso in left field, drove in Jim
A13 0500  5    Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last
A13 0510  2    of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory
A13 0510 14    over the Chicago White Sox Monday.
A13 0520  5       Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game,
A13 0530  5    a liner to center. He came all the way around on Gardner's
A13 0540  2    hit before 5777 fans. It was Gardner's second run batted
A13 0550  1    in of the game and his only ones of the year.
A13 0550 12       Turk Lown was tagged with the loss, his second against
A13 0560  9    no victories, while Ray Moore won his second game against
A13 0570  7    a single loss.
A13 0570 10       The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when
A13 0580  8    Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base
A13 0590  5    and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.
A13 0600  1       The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of
A13 0600 14    the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits- a triple by Roy
A13 0610 11    Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon- a walk and a
A13 0620  5    sacrifice fly.
A13 0620  7       Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first
A13 0630  8    inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead, but Harmon Killebrew
A13 0640  4    came back in the bottom of the first with his second
A13 0650  2    homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.
A13 0660  1       Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth- his
A13 0660 11    fourth homer of the campaign- tied the score and Carreon's
A13 0670  9    first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox
A13 0680  9    back in front.
A13 0680 12       A double by Green, Allison's run-scoring 2-baser,
A13 0690  7    an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single
A13 0700  5    to center put the Twins back in front in the last of
A13 0710  5    the fifth.
A13 0720  1    _OGDEN, UTAH, MAY 1- (AP)_
A13 0720  6       - Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday
A13 0740  5    night he was through playing baseball.
A13 0750  1       "I've had it", he told a newsman. "I know when my
A13 0750 12    reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th
A13 0760 11    man on the ball club".
A13 0770  1       This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden
A13 0770 11    walkout.
A13 0780  1       Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130
A13 0780 13    batting average in the first 12 games.
A13 0790  6       He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday,
A13 0800  2    without an official word to anybody, and has stayed
A13 0810  1    away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation
A13 0810 11    to Reno, Nev., where his wife, former Olympic Diving
A13 0820  7    Champion Zoe Ann Olsen, awaited.
A13 0830  2       She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home:
A13 0840  1    "I'm just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels
A13 0840 11    he's hurting Boston's chances".
A13 0850  4       The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner, City of
A13 0860  4    San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for a few minutes.
A13 0870  4    Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard
A13 0880  1    Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.
A13 0880 10       The conductor said to Ritchie: "I don't think you
A13 0890  8    want to talk to him. You'll probably get a ball bat
A13 0900  7    on the head. He's mad at the world".
A13 0910  2       But Jackie had gone into the station. Ritchie walked
A13 0920  1    up to him at the magazine stand.
A13 0920  8       "I told him who I was and he was quite cold. But
A13 0930  6    he warmed up after a while. I told him what Liston
A13 0940  2    had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and
A13 0940 13    said anything he (Liston) got was through a keyhole.
A13 0950  8    He said he had never talked to Liston".
A13 0960  4       Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer for the Boston
A13 0970  4    Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying:
A13 0980  1       "I can't hit anymore. I can't run. I can't throw.
A13 0990 10    Suddenly my reflexes are gone.
A13 1010  1       JUST WHEN IT SEEMS baseball might be losing its
A13 1010 10    grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions
A13 1020  9    of tongues to wagging.
A13 1030  1       And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old
A13 1030 13    Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against
A13 1040  8    the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating
A13 1050  4    with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday.
A13 1060  2       Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further
A13 1060 10    embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national
A13 1070  9    pastime.
A13 1080  1       Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's
A13 1080  9    hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts.
A13 1090  6       It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know
A13 1100  8    who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone. And
A13 1110  2    one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, "Wish
A13 1120  1    I was 40, and a top-grade big leaguer.
A13 1120 10    #@#
A13 1120 11    THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved off his new laurels
A13 1140  8    as one of those good days. But there surely can be
A13 1150  6    no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with
A13 1160  2    the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history.
A13 1170  1       Yes, with Bob Grove, Carl Hubbell, Herb Pennock,
A13 1170  9    Art Nehf, Vernon Gomez, et al.
A13 1180  5       Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly
A13 1190  4    fine fellow, a ball player's ball player, as they say
A13 1200  2    in the trade.
A13 1200  5       I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless
A13 1210  3    exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14, 1951, before
A13 1220  1    a new record crowd for the period of 18,792.
A13 1220 10    #@#
A13 1220 11    "SPAHNIE DOESN'T KNOW how to merely go through the
A13 1240  9    motions", remarked Enos Slaughter, another all-out
A13 1250  6    guy, who played rightfield that day and popped one
A13 1260  5    over the clubhouse.
A13 1260  8       The spectacular Mays, who reaches a decade in the
A13 1270  7    big leagues come May 25, joined six other sluggers
A13 1280  2    who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
A13 1290  1       Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience.
A13 1290 10    Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home
A13 1300 11    and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts
A13 1310  6    Field.
A13 1310  7       Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies, the
A13 1320  8    Braves' Joe Adcock, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees, Pat
A13 1330  6    Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito, then with
A13 1340  4    Cleveland, made their history on the road.
A13 1340 11    #@#
A13 1350  1    WILLIE'S BIG DAY REVIVED the running argument about
A13 1360  1    the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle.
A13 1370  8       This is an issue which boils down to a matter of
A13 1380  8    opinion, depending on whether you're an American or
A13 1390  4    National fan and anti or pro-Yankee. The record books,
A13 1400  2    however, would favor the Giants' ace.
A13 1400  8       In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as
A13 1410  7    many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases.
A13 1420  5    Once the figure was 30-30. Willie's lifetime batting
A13 1430  1    average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's.
A13 1430  9       The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their
A13 1440 11    windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in
A13 1450  7    Milwaukee's park. It will forever be a baseball mystery
A13 1460  5    how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing
A13 1470  3    slump.
A13 1470  4    #@#
A13 1470  5    THE DENVER-AREA TV audience was privileged to see
A13 1480  6    Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement made
A13 1490  4    by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked
A13 1500  1    out when his Bears are playing at home.
A13 1500  9       This rule providing for a blackout of televised
A13 1510  6    baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or
A13 1520  4    minor league game in any area comes from the game's
A13 1520 14    top rulers.
A13 1530  2       The last couple of years the Bears management got
A13 1540  1    the business from the "Living Room Athletic Club" when
A13 1540 10    games were cut off. Actually they were helpless to
A13 1550  9    do anything about the nationwide policy.
A13 1560  2       This year, I am told, the CBS network will continue
A13 1570  3    to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion
A13 1580  1    here. There are two more Sunday afternoons when the
A13 1580 10    situation will arise.
A13 1590  3       It is an irritable rule that does baseball more
A13 1600  1    harm than good, especially at the minor league level.
A13 1600 10    You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed
A13 1610  6    away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television
A13 1620  6    policy.
A13 1620  7       This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that
A13 1630  5    the video not be terminated before the end of the game.
A13 1650  1    _CINCINNATI, OHIO (AP)_
A13 1650  4       - The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world
A13 1660  5    series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati,
A13 1670  1    crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday
A13 1670 11    in the loosely played finale.
A13 1680  3       With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action
A13 1690  4    due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted
A13 1700  1    a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati
A13 1700 11    pitchers, the most ever used by one team in a series
A13 1710 11    game.
A13 1710 12       Johnny Blanchard, Mantle's replacement, slammed
A13 1720  4    a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay
A13 1730  4    in a 5-run first inning. Hector Lopez, subbing for
A13 1740  2    Berra, smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during
A13 1740 12    another 5-run explosion in the fourth.
A13 1750  5       The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati
A13 1760  3    errors.
A13 1760  4       The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud.
A13 1770  3       In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home
A13 1780  2    run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right
A13 1780 12    center, about 400 feet away, with two men on. Momentarily
A13 1790  9    the Reds were back in the ball game, trailing only
A13 1800  6    6-3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled
A13 1810  2    out with men on second and third and two out.
A13 1810 12       In the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off
A13 1820 11    Bud Daley, but by that time the score was 11-5 and
A13 1830  9    it really didn't matter.
A13 1830 13       The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third
A13 1840  9    man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series
A13 1850  9    victory in his first year as a manager. Only Bucky
A13 1860  4    Harris, the "boy-manager" of Washington in 1924, and
A13 1870  3    Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished
A13 1880  1    the feat.
