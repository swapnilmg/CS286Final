B07 0010  1    #THE U. N.'S 'GRAVEST CRISIS'#
B07 0010  6    Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U. N.'s
B07 0020  5    problem of electing a temporary successor to the late
B07 0030  5    Dag Hammarskjold as "the gravest crisis the institution
B07 0040  2    has faced". Of course it is. If the decision goes wrong,
B07 0050  1    it may be- as Mr. Stevenson fears- "the first step
B07 0050 11    on the slippery path downhill" to a U. N. without operational
B07 0060 10    responsibilities and without effective meaning.
B07 0070  5       The integrity of the office not merely requires
B07 0080  5    that the Secretary General shall be, as the Charter
B07 0090  3    puts it, "the chief administrative officer of the Organization",
B07 0100  1    but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive
B07 0100 12    instructions from any government or any other authority
B07 0110  8    "external to the Organization". In other words, the
B07 0120  7    Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan, international
B07 0130  4    servant, not a political, national one. He should be,
B07 0140  4    as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the
B07 0150  1    world.
B07 0150  2       The Charter does stipulate that "due regard" shall
B07 0160  1    be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on
B07 0160 11    "as wide a geographical basis as possible". The United
B07 0170  6    States and its allies have had no objection to this.
B07 0180  6    What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians
B07 0190  4    to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death
B07 0200  2    to turn the entire U. N. staff from the Secretary down
B07 0210  1    into political agents of the respective countries from
B07 0210  9    which they come.
B07 0220  1       The controversy now revolves mainly around the number
B07 0220  9    and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary
B07 0230  8    General and, more particularly, around the nature of
B07 0240  5    his relationship with them. Although the United States
B07 0250  4    and the U. S. S. R. have been arguing whether there
B07 0260  3    shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most
B07 0260 13    important element in the situation is not the number
B07 0270  9    of deputies but the manner in which these deputies
B07 0280  6    are to do their work.
B07 0280 11       If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary
B07 0290 10    General's decisions the nature of the organization
B07 0300  6    will have changed. If they give him advice when he
B07 0310  3    asks it, or if they perform specified duties under
B07 0310 12    his direction, the nature of the U. N. will not of
B07 0320 10    necessity change. The Secretary General must have,
B07 0330  6    subject to the constitutional direction of the Security
B07 0340  4    Council and the General Assembly, the power to act,
B07 0350  3    to propose action and to organize action without being
B07 0350 12    hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone
B07 0360  8    else's instructions.
B07 0370  1       This is the root issue for which the United States
B07 0370 11    should stand. We should not become confused or let
B07 0380  8    our public become confused over irrelevant questions
B07 0390  3    of number or even of geography. What we must have,
B07 0400  2    if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical,
B07 0400 12    nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings
B07 0410  9    can make it, subject to no single nation's direction
B07 0420  6    and subservient to no single nation's ambition.
B07 0430  2    #WHAT THE NEW CHARTER DOES#
B07 0430  7    The new City Charter, which should get a Yes vote as
B07 0440  8    Question No. 1 on Nov. 7, would not make a good Mayor
B07 0450  6    out of a bad one. There is no such magic in man-made
B07 0460  4    laws. But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive
B07 0470  1    powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is
B07 0470 11    a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase
B07 0480  8    his budget-making authority both as to expense and
B07 0490  6    capital budgets, and vest in him the right to reorganize
B07 0500  3    city departments in the interest of efficiency and
B07 0500 11    economy.
B07 0510  1       Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate
B07 0515  1    and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council
B07 0520  8    and the Mayor. Thus there is a clearer division of
B07 0530  7    authority, administrative and legislative. The board
B07 0540  3    is diminished in both respects, while it retains control
B07 0550  1    over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing
B07 0550  8    and assignment of property, and other trusteeship functions.
B07 0560  7    The board will be able to increase, decrease, add or
B07 0570  6    eliminate budget items, subject to the Mayor's veto;
B07 0580  3    but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering
B07 0590  3    power. Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes
B07 0600  1    will require concurrence by board and Council, and
B07 0600  9    a two-thirds vote.
B07 0610  1       The Controller retains his essential "fiscal watchdog"
B07 0610  8    functions; his broad but little used investigative
B07 0620  7    powers are confirmed. He loses now-misplaced tax collection
B07 0630  7    duties, which go to the Finance Department. On net
B07 0640  4    balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition
B07 0650  2    to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the
B07 0650 13    Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness
B07 0660  8    to good government than he has now.
B07 0670  5       Borough Presidents, while retaining membership in
B07 0680  3    the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions.
B07 0690  1    Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers
B07 0690 10    to the Department of Public Works, such street cleaning
B07 0700  7    as Borough Presidents now do (in Queens and Richmond)
B07 0710  7    to the Sanitation Department.
B07 0720  1       Some fiscal changes are important. The expense (operating)
B07 0720  9    budget is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut
B07 0730 12    to allow greater autonomy (with the Mayor approving)
B07 0740  5    in fund transfers within a department. The capital
B07 0750  3    budget, for construction of permanent improvements,
B07 0750  9    becomes an appropriating document instead of just a
B07 0760  8    calendar of pious promises; but, as a second-look safeguard,
B07 0770  7    each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public
B07 0780  6    hearing before construction proceeds.
B07 0790  1       A road block to desirable local or borough improvements,
B07 0790 10    heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers
B07 0800  8    and hence a drag on progress, is removed by making
B07 0810  6    these a charge against the whole city instead of an
B07 0820  4    assessment paid by those immediately affected. This
B07 0820 11    will have a beneficial effect by expediting public
B07 0830  8    business; it will also correct some injustices.
B07 0840  4       Enlargement of the City Council and a new method
B07 0850  5    of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.
B07 0860  1    #INTER-AMERICAN PRESS#
B07 0860  4    The Inter-american Press Association, which blankets
B07 0870  3    the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape
B07 0880  1    Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the
B07 0880 12    first time in eleven years. The I. A. P. A. is a reflection
B07 0890 11    of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere; and in
B07 0900  8    these days this inevitably means a concentration on
B07 0910  5    the effects of the Cuban revolution.
B07 0920  1       As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by
B07 0920  9    the Castro regime, more and more Cuban publishers,
B07 0930  6    editors and correspondents were forced into exile.
B07 0940  3    The I. A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism
B07 0950  1    into politics as it did its best to bring about the
B07 0950 12    downfall of the Castro Government and the return of
B07 0960  9    the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's
B07 0970  6    dictatorship began in 1952.
B07 0980  1       Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of
B07 0980 10    decades of corruption and social imbalances. In such
B07 0990  6    conditions all freedoms are lost. This, in more diplomatic
B07 1000  5    language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper
B07 1010  2    men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United
B07 1010 12    States Government. He felt able to end on a note of
B07 1020 11    hope. He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year
B07 1030  8    Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social
B07 1040  5    reforms. No group can contribute more to the success
B07 1050  2    of the program than the editors and publishers of the
B07 1050 12    Inter-American Press Association.
B07 1060  3    #MEETING IN MOSCOW#
B07 1060  6    The Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens
B07 1070  6    in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply
B07 1080  4    with the script prepared many months ago when this
B07 1090  3    meeting was first announced. According to the original
B07 1090 11    program, Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking
B07 1100  7    toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration
B07 1110  8    or rage- depending upon individual or national politics-
B07 1120  6    because of the "bold program for building communism
B07 1130  4    in our time" which the Congress will adopt. But far
B07 1140  3    from being concerned about whether or not Russia will
B07 1140 12    have achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching
B07 1150  9    Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not
B07 1160  8    there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future.
B07 1170  4       The evident contradiction between the rosy picture
B07 1180  2    of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's
B07 1190  1    program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed
B07 1190 10    by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led
B07 1200  7    to speculation abroad that the program may be severely
B07 1210  6    altered. Whether it is or not, the propaganda impact
B07 1220  2    on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted
B07 1230  1    at this meeting will be far less than had been originally
B07 1230 12    anticipated. And there must be many Soviet citizens
B07 1240  8    who know what is going on and who realize that before
B07 1250  6    they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980
B07 1260  3    they and their children must first survive.
B07 1260 10       This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating
B07 1270  7    his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly
B07 1280  7    succession should death or illness remove him from
B07 1290  4    the scene in the next few years. The widespread purge
B07 1300  1    that has taken place the past twelve months or so among
B07 1300 12    Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance
B07 1310  7    that the party officials who will dominate the Congress,
B07 1320  5    and the Central Committee it will elect, will all have
B07 1330  4    passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening,
B07 1330 10    both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance
B07 1340 10    on the job.
B07 1350  1    #DR. CONANT'S CALL TO ACTION#
B07 1350  6    Dr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation
B07 1360  5    as a moderate and unemotional school reformer. His
B07 1370  2    earlier reports considered the American public schools
B07 1380  1    basically sound and not in need of drastic change.
B07 1380 10    Now, a close look at the schools in and around the
B07 1390  8    ten largest cities, including New York, has shattered
B07 1400  3    this optimism. Dr. Conant has come away shocked and
B07 1410  2    angry. His new book, entitled "Slums and Suburbs",
B07 1410 10    calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster.
B07 1420  8       There is room for disagreement concerning some of
B07 1430  5    Dr. Conant's specific views. His strong opposition
B07 1440  3    to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside
B07 1450  1    their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration,
B07 1450  9    will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for,
B07 1460  9    and achieved, this open or permissive enrollment. Dr.
B07 1470  5    Conant may underestimate the psychological importance
B07 1480  2    of even token equality.
B07 1480  6       His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made
B07 1490  6    the training institutions for medical, law and graduate
B07 1500  4    schools will run into strong opposition from these
B07 1500 12    colleges themselves- even though what he is recommending
B07 1510  7    is already taking shape as a trend.
B07 1520  5       But these are side issues to a powerful central
B07 1530  2    theme. That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency
B07 1530  9    and double-talk. It labels the slums, especially the
B07 1540  9    Negro slums, as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands
B07 1550  6    of youngsters. The villains of the piece are those
B07 1560  6    who deny job opportunities to these youngsters, and
B07 1570  2    Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike.
B07 1570 10    The facts, he adds, are hidden from public view by
B07 1580  9    squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their
B07 1590  5    right name and by insistence on token integration rather
B07 1600  2    than on real improvement of the schools, regardless
B07 1600 10    of the color of their students.
B07 1610  6       A call for action "before it is too late" has alarming
B07 1620  6    implications when it comes from a man who, in his previous
B07 1630  2    reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against
B07 1630 10    extreme measures. These warnings must not be treated
B07 1640  8    lightly. Dr. Conant's conscientious, selfless efforts
B07 1650  4    deserve the nation's gratitude. He has served in positions
B07 1660  6    of greater glamour, both at home and abroad; but he
B07 1670  3    may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward
B07 1680  1    report on the state of the public schools.
B07 1690  1    #AND NOW- MORE JUNK MAIL#
B07 1690  6    A fascinating letter has just reached this desk from
B07 1700  4    a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk
B07 1700 13    mail. He was delighted to learn that the Post Office
B07 1710 10    Department is now going to expand this service to deliver
B07 1720  8    mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents
B07 1730  6    without the use of stamps, names, addresses or even
B07 1740  3    zone numbers. In accordance with legislation passed
B07 1750  1    at the last session of Congress, each Representative
B07 1750  9    is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk
B07 1760  8    newsletters, speeches and other literature to be dropped
B07 1770  5    in every letter box in his district. This means an
B07 1780  2    added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are
B07 1780 10    complaining of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably
B07 1790 10    means an increased postal deficit, but, our correspondent
B07 1800  5    writes, think of the additional junk mail each citizen
B07 1810  4    will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.

B07 1820  2    #OUR CREDITORS DO NOT FORGET US#
B07 1820  8    Letter writing is a dying art. Occasional letters are
B07 1830  5    sent by individuals to one another and many are written
B07 1840  4    by companies to one another, but these are mostly typewritten.
B07 1850  2    Most mail these days consists of nothing that could
B07 1850 11    truly be called a letter.
