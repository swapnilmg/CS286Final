D02 0010  1    If the content of faith is to be presented today in
D02 0010 12    a form that can be "understanded of the people"- and
D02 0020  6    this, it must not be forgotten, is one of the goals
D02 0030  6    of the perennial theological task- there is no other
D02 0040  3    choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner
D02 0040 11    of representation.
D02 0050  1       This does not mean that mythological language as
D02 0060  1    such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.
D02 0060 11    The absurd notion that demythologization entails the
D02 0070  5    expurgation of all mythological concepts completely
D02 0080  3    misrepresents Bultmann's intention. His point is not
D02 0090  3    that mythology may not be used, but that it may no
D02 0090 14    longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate
D02 0100  9    conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma.
D02 0110  4    When we say that a mythological mode of thought must
D02 0120  4    be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned
D02 0130  1    as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian
D02 0130 11    understanding of existence. Mythological concepts may
D02 0140  6    by all means still be used, but they can be used responsibly
D02 0150  7    only as "symbols" or "ciphers", that is, only if they
D02 0160  6    are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological
D02 0170  1    (or existential) terms.
D02 0170  4       The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues
D02 0180  5    in this way, he "overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block
D02 0190  3    which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting
D02 0200  1    the Christian faith". But this statement is completely
D02 0200  9    unconvincing. If Bultmann's own definition of myth
D02 0210  7    is strictly adhered to (and it is interesting that
D02 0220  7    this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements),
D02 0230  4    the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all
D02 0240  4    exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts
D02 0240 12    of traditional theology have become incredible and
D02 0250  7    irrelevant. Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence
D02 0260  8    in the great urban centers of our culture that are
D02 0270  4    admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly
D02 0280  1    estranged from the conventional forms in which the
D02 0280  9    gospel has been communicated. On the contrary, even
D02 0290  6    in the heart of "the Bible belt" itself, as can be
D02 0300  6    attested by any one who is called to work there, the
D02 0310  2    industrial and technological revolutions have long
D02 0310  8    been under way, together with the corresponding changes
D02 0320  7    in man's picture of himself and his world.
D02 0330  4       In fact, it is in just such a situation that the
D02 0340  3    profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed. Although
D02 0350  1    the theological forms of the past continue to exist
D02 0350 10    in a way they do not in a more secularized situation,
D02 0360  7    the striking thing is the rapidity with which they
D02 0370  4    are being reduced to a marginal existence. This is
D02 0380  1    especially in evidence among the present generation
D02 0380  8    of the suburban middle class. Time and again in counseling
D02 0390  7    and teaching, one encounters members of this group
D02 0400  5    whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the
D02 0410  2    insubstantial mythologies of their "fundamentalist"
D02 0410  7    heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world
D02 0420  9    are only too painfully obvious.
D02 0430  1       The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme
D02 0430 10    "culture-Protestantism" so often observed to characterize
D02 0440  6    the preaching and teaching of the American churches.
D02 0450  7    In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in
D02 0460  3    which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable
D02 0470  1    need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources
D02 0470 10    are at hand- and this usually means one or another
D02 0480  8    of the various forms of "folk religion" current in
D02 0490  5    the situation. This is not to say that the only explanation
D02 0500  4    of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's
D02 0510  2    "cult of reassurance" or the other types of a purely
D02 0520  1    cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for
D02 0520  9    a demythologized gospel. But it is to say that this
D02 0530  9    need is far more important for such infatuation than
D02 0540  3    most of the pundits seem to have suspected.
D02 0550  1       However, even if the latent demand for demythologization
D02 0550  9    is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming, at
D02 0560  8    least among the cultured elements of the population
D02 0570  4    there tends to be an almost complete indifference to
D02 0580  2    the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.
D02 0580 12    To be sure, when this is pointed out, a common response
D02 0590 10    among certain churchmen is to fulminate about "the
D02 0600  6    little flock" and "the great crowd" and to take solace
D02 0610  5    from Paul's castigation of the "wisdom of the wise"
D02 0620  3    in the opening chapter of First Corinthians. But can
D02 0630  1    we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation?
D02 0630 11    Can the church risk assuming that the "folly" of men
D02 0640  8    is as dear to God as their "wisdom", or, as is also
D02 0650  6    commonly implied, that "the foolishness of God" and
D02 0660  4    "the foolishness of men" are simply two ways of talking
D02 0670  3    about the same thing? Can we continue to alienate precisely
D02 0680  1    those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart
D02 0680 10    from whose co-operation our mission in the world must
D02 0690  7    become increasingly precarious?
D02 0700  1       There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the
D02 0700 10    church (which derives, however, from the heritage of
D02 0710  7    the Greeks rather than from the Bible) that God is
D02 0720  6    completely independent of his creation and so has no
D02 0730  4    need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.
D02 0730 14    by analogy, the church also has been regarded as entirely
D02 0740  9    independent of the "world" in the sense of requiring
D02 0750  7    nothing from it in order to be the church. But, as
D02 0760  5    Scripture everywhere reminds us, God does have need
D02 0770  3    of his creatures, and the church, a fortiori, can ill
D02 0770 13    afford to do without the talents with which the world,
D02 0780 10    by God's providence, presents it.
D02 0790  3       And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we
D02 0800  2    assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to
D02 0800 13    preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible
D02 0810  9    and irrelevant to cultured men. Until we translate
D02 0820  5    this gospel into a language that enlightened men today
D02 0830  3    can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very
D02 0830 12    resources on which the continued success of our witness
D02 0840  9    most certainly depends.
D02 0850  1       In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking
D02 0850 10    for granted that a demythologized restatement of the
D02 0860  7    kerygma can be achieved; and that we firmly believe
D02 0870  6    this will presently become evident when we set forth
D02 0880  4    reasons to justify such a conviction. But the main
D02 0880 13    point here is that even if such a restatement were
D02 0890 10    not possible, the demand to demythologize the kerygma
D02 0900  6    would still be unavoidable.
D02 0910  1       This is what we mean when we say this demand must
D02 0910 11    be accepted without condition. If to be a Christian
D02 0920  7    means to say yes where I otherwise say no, or where
D02 0930  5    I do not have the right to say anything at all, then
D02 0940  1    my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian. Expressed
D02 0940 12    differently: if the price for becoming a faithful follower
D02 0950  9    of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction, whether
D02 0960  8    of the body or of the mind- sacrificium corporis, sacrificium
D02 0970  6    intellectus- then there is no alternative but that
D02 0980  5    the price remain unpaid.
D02 0980  9       This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential
D02 0990  7    to the argument of this concluding chapter. Modern
D02 1000  3    man, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us, has "come
D02 1010  2    of age"; and though this process by no means represents
D02 1020  1    an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the
D02 1020 11    estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost
D02 1030  9    of human maturation, it is still a positive step forward;
D02 1040  5    and those of us who so richly benefit from it should
D02 1050  3    be the last to despise it. In any event, it is an irreversible
D02 1060  1    step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we
D02 1060 12    will know we have no other alternative than to live
D02 1070  8    in the world in which God has seen fit to place us.
D02 1080  6       To say this, of course, is to take up a position
D02 1090  2    on one side of a controversy going on now for some
D02 1090 13    two hundred years, or, at any rate, since the beginning
D02 1100  9    of the distinctively modern period in theological thought.
D02 1110  5    We have aligned ourselves with that "liberal" tradition
D02 1120  3    in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great
D02 1130  3    names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl,
D02 1140  1    Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently,
D02 1140  8    Schweitzer and the early Barth and, in part at least,
D02 1150  9    Bultmann. It is to this same tradition that most of
D02 1160  5    the creative figures in the last century and a half
D02 1170  3    of American theology also belong. For we must number
D02 1170 12    here not only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch,
D02 1180  9    not to mention those of "the Chicago School" and Macintosh,
D02 1190  8    but those of the brothers Niebuhr and (if America may
D02 1200  8    claim him!) Tillich as well. Finally, we may also mention
D02 1210  7    the several members of the self-consciously "neoliberal"
D02 1220  2    movement that developed at the University of Chicago
D02 1230  3    and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative
D02 1230 11    work of Alfred North Whitehead.
D02 1240  5       What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially
D02 1250  3    one is that those who have belonged to it have been
D02 1260  3    profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively
D02 1270  1    modern world. Although they have also been concerned
D02 1270  9    to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic
D02 1280  7    church, they have exhibited no willingness whatever
D02 1290  4    to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity.
D02 1300  1    They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely
D02 1310  1    within modern culture and, so far from considering
D02 1310  9    this treason to God, have looked upon it as the only
D02 1320  8    way they could be faithful to him.
D02 1330  1       When we say, then, that today, in our situation,
D02 1330 10    the demand for demythologization must be accepted without
D02 1340  6    condition, we are simply saying that at least this
D02 1350  6    much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement.
D02 1360  2    However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's
D02 1370  1    constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves
D02 1370  7    must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism,
D02 1380  8    not behind it.
D02 1390  1       In affirming this we have already taken the decisive
D02 1390 10    step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's
D02 1400  6    attempt to formulate such a theology has led. For we
D02 1410  6    have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives
D02 1420  1    to his position variously represented by the other
D02 1420  9    participants in the demythologizing discussion, only
D02 1430  6    one is really an alternative. If the demand for demythologization
D02 1440  6    is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology
D02 1460  3    unconditionally, the position of the "right" is clearly
D02 1470  2    untenable. Whereas Bultmann's "center" position is
D02 1470  8    structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible
D02 1480  6    on formal grounds alone, the general position of the
D02 1490  7    "right", as represented, say, by Karl Barth, involves
D02 1500  5    the rejection or at least qualification of the demand
D02 1510  3    for demythologization and so is invalidated on the
D02 1510 11    material grounds we have just considered.
D02 1520  6       It follows, then, provided the possibilities have
D02 1530  4    been exhausted, that the only real alternative is the
D02 1540  3    general viewpoint of the "left", which has been represented
D02 1550  1    on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent
D02 1550 11    at least, is found in much that is significant in American
D02 1560 10    and English theology.
D02 1570  1       In order to make the implications of our position
D02 1570 10    as clear as possible, we may develop this argument
D02 1580  8    at greater length.
D02 1580 11       We may show, first, that there cannot possibly be
D02 1590  9    an alternative other than the three typically represented
D02 1600  6    by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri. To do this, it is sufficient
D02 1610  7    to point out that if the principle in terms of which
D02 1620  3    alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude
D02 1620 13    more than two, then the question of a "third" possibility
D02 1630 10    is a meaningless question. Thus, if what is at issue
D02 1640  8    is whether "All S is P", it is indifferent whether
D02 1650  7    "Some S is not P" or "No S is P", since in either
D02 1660  9    case the judgment in question is false. Hence, if what
D02 1670  6    is in question is whether in a given theology myth
D02 1680  2    is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant
D02 1680 11    whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable
D02 1690 10    quantity is accepted; for, in either event, the first
D02 1700  7    possibility is excluded. Therefore, the only conceivable
D02 1710  4    alternatives are those represented, on the one hand,
D02 1720  1    by the two at least apparently self-consistent but
D02 1720 10    mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and,
D02 1730  7    on the other hand, by the third but really pseudo position
D02 1740  5    (analogous to a round square) of Bultmann.
D02 1750  1       A second point requires more extended comment. It
D02 1750  9    will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that
D02 1760  8    the position of the "right", as represented by Barth,
D02 1770  5    rests on the following thesis: The only tenable alternative
D02 1780  4    to Bultmann's position is a theology that (1) rejects
D02 1790  3    or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for
D02 1790 11    demythologization and existential interpretation; (2)
D02 1800  5    accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or
D02 1810  5    method of interpretation; and (3) in so doing, frees
D02 1820  5    itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus
D02 1830  1    Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's
D02 1830  9    point of view, are mythological.
