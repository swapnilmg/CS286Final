L16 0010  1       "Dammit, Phil, are you trying to wreck my career?
L16 0010 10    Because that's what you're doing- wrecking it, wrecking
L16 0020  8    it, wrecking it"! Griffith had confronted Hoag on the
L16 0030  7    building's front steps- Hoag had been permitted no
L16 0040  8    further- and backed him against a wrought-iron railing.
L16 0050  2    His rage had built up as he made his way here from
L16 0060  1    the second floor, helped by the quantity of champagne
L16 0060 10    he had consumed.
L16 0070  1       Hoag said, "I didn't send for you, Leigh. I want
L16 0070 11    the captain in charge. Where is he"?
L16 0080  7       "Phil, for God's sake, go away. The undersecretary's
L16 0090  5    in there. I told you there's nothing between Midge
L16 0100  4    and me, nothing. It's all in your mind". A couple of
L16 0110  3    sobs escaped him, followed by a sentiment that revealed
L16 0110 12    his emotional state. "Why, I'm not fit to touch the
L16 0120 10    hem of her garment".
L16 0130  1       "Leigh, get a grip on yourself. It's not about you
L16 0140  1    or Midge. I have some security information about the
L16 0140 10    prime minister".
L16 0150  1       Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed
L16 0160  1    eyes. "Not about me? You mean it, Phil? You wouldn't
L16 0160 11    pull my leg, old man? I did get you on the platform
L16 0170 12    this morning".
L16 0180  1       "I'm not pulling your leg. Will you call that captain"?
L16 0190  1       "No use, he won't come". He peered closely at Hoag
L16 0200  1    in the gathering darkness. "What happened to your head"?
L16 0210  1       "I was hit- knocked out. Now will you get him"?
L16 0210 11       "He says I'm to take the message". He stared at
L16 0220 10    Hoag drunkenly. "Who'd hit you in the head"?
L16 0230  7       "It doesn't matter. You get back to the captain
L16 0240  7    and tell him this: Somebody's going to take a shot
L16 0250  5    at the prime minister, and Mahzeer is in on the plot.
L16 0260  1    Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime
L16 0260 10    minister with Mahzeer".
L16 0270  1       Griffith said, "That's impossible. Mahzeer's the
L16 0280  2    ambassador".
L16 0280  3       "Nevertheless it's true".
L16 0290  1       "Impossible". Griffith was trying to clear his head
L16 0290  8    of the champagne fuzz that encased it. "I'll show you
L16 0300  8    how wrong you are. Mahzeer and the prime minister are
L16 0310  6    alone right now". He nodded triumphantly. "So that
L16 0320  3    proves it"!
L16 0320  5       Hoag looked terrified. "Where are they"?
L16 0330  3       "Where'd you expect, the john? Mahzeer's office".
L16 0340  2       "Where is that"?
L16 0340  5       "Facing us, two flights up. Look, old man, you can't
L16 0350  9    go up. They won't even let you in the front door. So
L16 0360  8    why don't you be a good boy and"-
L16 0370  3       Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders. "Listen to me,
L16 0370 12    Leigh. If you want to spend another day in the State
L16 0380 11    Department- another day- you get in there and tell
L16 0390  7    that captain what I told you". He bit out the words.
L16 0400  6    "And you know I can do it".
L16 0400 13       Griffith raised placating hands. "Easy does it,
L16 0410  7    Phil. I was just going. I'm on my way". He turned and
L16 0420  8    fled into the house and made his way up the marble
L16 0430  6    stairs without once looking back. On the second landing
L16 0440  2    he paused to look for Docherty, didn't see him, and
L16 0440 12    accepted a glass of champagne. He took several large
L16 0450  9    swallows, recollected that Docherty had gone up another
L16 0460  7    flight, and decided he would be wise to cover himself
L16 0470  4    by finding him. The way Hoag was, no telling what he
L16 0480  2    might say or do. He finished his champagne and climbed
L16 0480 12    uncertainly to the next landing. At the top a uniformed
L16 0490 10    officer blocked further progress. "Yes, what is it"?
L16 0500  6    he asked.
L16 0500  8       "I want Captain Docherty". He spotted Docherty coming
L16 0510  6    out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called
L16 0520  7    to him.
L16 0520  9       Docherty said, "It's okay, Bonfiglio, let him by".
L16 0530  6    They walked toward each other. "Well"?
L16 0540  2       Griffith said, "Hoag told me to tell you"- he waited
L16 0550  5    until they were close; it was hideously embarrassing-
L16 0560  1    "not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer".
L16 0560 11       Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain; it
L16 0570  8    would be just like him. "Why not"?
L16 0580  3       "He claims Mahzeer's in a plot to kill the P.M.".
L16 0590  3       Docherty went taut: was it possible? Could the ambassador
L16 0600  4    himself be the man on this side the prime minister
L16 0610  1    feared? Not possible, he thought; the prime minister
L16 0610  9    knew who his enemy was here; he wasn't going to allow
L16 0620 10    himself to be led meekly to the slaughter. And if by
L16 0630  7    some wild chance Mahzeer was the man, he wouldn't dare
L16 0640  4    try anything now- not after Docherty had looked in
L16 0650  2    on the two of them to see that all was well. Docherty
L16 0650 14    was damned if he would make a fool of himself again
L16 0660 10    the way he had earlier over the laundry truck. One
L16 0670  5    more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be
L16 0680  2    leading him away. Still, this had to be checked out.
L16 0690  1       "Where'd your friend Hoag get his information"?
L16 0690  7    he asked.
L16 0700  1       "Haven't the faintest, Captain".
L16 0700  5       "Would you mind sending him up here? I'd like to
L16 0710  8    talk to him". Troubled, he continued along the corridor,
L16 0720  4    poking his head into the next office for a careful
L16 0730  3    look around.
L16 0730  5    #3#
L16 0730  6    But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith
L16 0740  4    disappeared into the building. He was unwilling to
L16 0750  2    rely on Griffith's carrying his message, and he had
L16 0750 11    no confidence the police would act on it. If Mahzeer
L16 0760  9    was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging
L16 0770  5    his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in
L16 0780  3    the darkening street. He would have to do something
L16 0780 12    on his own. But what?
L16 0790  4       The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari
L16 0800  4    swept past him and down the stairs. In the lighted
L16 0800 14    interior he saw other men and women struggling into
L16 0810  9    their wraps. These were the early departures; in half
L16 0820  6    an hour the reception would be over. If Mahzeer was
L16 0830  3    planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he
L16 0830 13    would have to do it in the next few minutes. Hoag descended
L16 0840 12    the stone steps to the street and looked up at the
L16 0850 10    building. Wide windows with many small leaded panes
L16 0860  5    swept across the upper stories. On the second floor
L16 0870  2    he saw the animated faces of the party guests; the
L16 0870 12    scene looked like a Christmas card. On the third floor
L16 0880  9    one of the two windows was lighted; it was framed in
L16 0890  7    maroon drapes, and no faces were visible. This would
L16 0900  3    be Mahzeer's office. He and the prime minister would
L16 0910  1    be back from the window, seated at Mahzeer's desk;
L16 0910 10    they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as
L16 0920  9    excuse for just such a meeting. In a minute, or five
L16 0930  6    minutes, the business would be done; Mahzeer would
L16 0940  2    stand up, the prime minister would follow. Mahzeer
L16 0940 10    would direct the prime minister's attention to something
L16 0950  7    out the window and would guide him forward and then
L16 0960  7    step to one side. The single shot would come; Hoag
L16 0970  3    would carry its sound to his grave. Mahzeer, of course,
L16 0980  1    would be desolate. How was he to suspect that an assassin
L16 0980 12    had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting
L16 0990  7    for just such a chance?
L16 1000  1       Hoag turned. Where across the street? Where was
L16 1000  9    Muller waiting with the rifle? Narrow four-story buildings
L16 1010  9    ran the length of the block like books tightly packed
L16 1020  8    on a shelf. Most of them could be eliminated; Muller's
L16 1030  4    would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly
L16 1040  3    opposite. The legation was generously set back from
L16 1050  1    the building line; if the angle of fire were too great
L16 1050 12    the jutting buildings on either side would interfere.
L16 1060  6    Would the shot come from a roof? He ran his eye along
L16 1070  6    the roof copings; almost at once a figure bulked up.
L16 1080  3    But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons
L16 1080 13    and badge of a policeman. With a cop patrolling the
L16 1090 10    road Muller would have to be inside a building- if
L16 1100  8    he was here at all, and not waiting for the prime minister
L16 1110  5    somewhere between this street and the terminal building
L16 1120  2    at La Guardia Airport.
L16 1120  6       Hoag crossed the narrow street, squeezing between
L16 1130  3    parked cars to reach the sidewalk. From this side he
L16 1140  3    could see farther into the legation's third-story window,
L16 1140 12    but he saw no faces; the room's occupants were still
L16 1150 10    seated or they had been called into the hallway by
L16 1160  8    an alarmed police captain. If only the latter were
L16 1170  4    true ... He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning
L16 1180  1    their facades: one was a club- that was out; two others
L16 1180 12    he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.
L16 1190  9    That left three, possibly four, one looking much like
L16 1200  6    the next. He climbed the steps of the first and opened
L16 1210  5    the door to the vestibule. He quickly closed it again.
L16 1220  2    He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided
L16 1220 12    into apartments, but this one, from a glance at the
L16 1230 10    hall furnishings, was obviously still a functioning
L16 1240  5    town house, and its owners were in residence; that
L16 1250  2    made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose
L16 1250 13    plans had to be made in advance.
L16 1260  7       He went on to the next building and found what he
L16 1270  4    expected- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.
L16 1280  1    On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes;
L16 1280 13    there were six apartments. Now what? The names on the
L16 1290 10    mailboxes meant nothing to him. This was senseless-
L16 1300  7    he had no idea what to look for. He peered in the boxes
L16 1310  6    themselves; all were empty except one, and that one
L16 1320  3    was jammed with letters and magazines. The occupants
L16 1320 11    of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few
L16 1330  9    days, and not likely to return on a Friday. Had Muller
L16 1340  7    made the same deduction? Muller was attracted to the
L16 1350  5    lore of mailboxes.
L16 1350  8       He opened the inner door; the cooking odors were
L16 1360  3    stronger- all over the city, at this hour, housewives
L16 1370  1    would be fussing over stoves. He climbed, as quickly
L16 1370 10    as he could urge his body, up the two unbroken flights
L16 1380  8    to the third floor, pulling himself along on a delicate
L16 1390  6    balustrade, all that remained of the building's beauty.
L16 1400  2    He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and
L16 1410  1    then bent to examine the single door by the light of
L16 1410 12    the weak bulb overhead. Now he was certain: the lock
L16 1420  8    had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys; fresh
L16 1430  5    scars showed that the door had been prized open. It
L16 1440  4    had been shut again, but the lock was broken; he noted
L16 1450  1    with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his
L16 1450 12    touch.
L16 1460  1       What was he to do now? He had thought no further
L16 1460 11    than finding Muller. He realized now he had more than
L16 1470  8    half hoped he wouldn't find him- that Muller would
L16 1480  4    not be here, that the attempt would be scheduled for
L16 1490  2    somewhere beyond Hoag's control. He could not break
L16 1490 10    in on an armed man. He would have to climb back down
L16 1500 11    to the street and signal a cop. Was there time?
L16 1510  6       His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report
L16 1520  4    of a rifle from the other side of the door. Hoag pushed
L16 1530  1    open the door: at the far end of the long dark room
L16 1530 13    Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window,
L16 1540  6    the rifle still raised; he stood with his feet apart
L16 1550  5    on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill. He turned
L16 1560  3    his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly
L16 1560 13    back to the window and his rifle sight, dismissing
L16 1570  9    Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown
L16 1580  8    in their encounter at Hoag's apartment.
L16 1590  1       Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled
L16 1600  1    for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark. The room
L16 1600 11    was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second
L16 1610  7    shot came. Muller, nakedly exposed at the bright window
L16 1620  6    like a deer pinned in a car's headlights, threw down
L16 1630  3    the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face
L16 1640  1    wore a look of outrage. A shot caught him and straightened
L16 1640 12    him up in screaming pain; a following volley of shots
L16 1650  8    shattered glass, ripped the ceiling, and sent him lurching
L16 1670  6    heavily from the table. He was dead before his body
L16 1680  4    made contact with the floor. Hoag stumbled back into
L16 1690  1    the hall, leaned against the wall, and started to retch.
L16 1690 11    #4#
L16 1690 12    After Captain Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag
L16 1700  8    he was able to complete his detailed inspection of
L16 1710  6    the third floor and to receive a report from his man
L16 1720  5    covering the floors above before Griffith returned,
L16 1730  1    buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.
