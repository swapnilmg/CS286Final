F47 0010  1    The deep water is used by many people, but it is always
F47 0010 13    clean, for the washing is done outside. I know now
F47 0020  8    why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked
F47 0030  5    into our bathroom.
F47 0030  8       Of course, most toilets are Eastern style- at floor
F47 0040  7    level- but even when they are raised to chair height,
F47 0050  5    they are actually outside toilets- inside. A few newer
F47 0060  4    homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running
F47 0070  1    water, they are usually Eastern style.
F47 0070  7       The next day I visited International Christian College
F47 0080  4    which has developed since the war under the leadership
F47 0090  4    of people who were interned and who know Japan well.
F47 0100  2    They are trying to demonstrate some different ways
F47 0100 10    of teaching and learning. The library has open shelves
F47 0110  8    even in the unbound periodical stockroom. Spiritual
F47 0120  3    life is cultivated, but students do not need to be
F47 0130  3    Christian. They have an enviable record of being able
F47 0130 12    to place in employment 100% of their graduates.
F47 0140  7       In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited
F47 0150  6    me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the
F47 0160  5    famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs. Hosaka
F47 0170  2    is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful,
F47 0180  1    artistically talented, an artful manager of her big
F47 0180  9    household- (four boys and four girls), and yet looking
F47 0190  9    like a pampered, gentle Japanese woman. She was a real
F47 0200  6    experience! The dances were as beautiful as anything
F47 0210  3    I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes
F47 0220  1    for scenery and precision as well as imagination.
F47 0220  9       Because Don was leaving the next day, I spent the
F47 0230 10    evening with him at Asia Center. The following morning
F47 0240  5    Mr. Morikawa called for me, and we went to visit schools-
F47 0250  6    kindergarten, middle-school, elementary school, and
F47 0260  3    high school- Mr. Yoshimoto's school. There is much
F47 0270  3    more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some
F47 0270 13    think too much.
F47 0280  3       There is a great deal of thought being given to
F47 0290  1    the question of moral education in the schools. With
F47 0290 10    the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan, the people
F47 0300  7    are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings
F47 0310  4    that have strength. The older parents continued to
F47 0320  2    teach their children traditional principles, but the
F47 0320  9    younger people, who have lost all faith and convictions,
F47 0330  8    are now parents. There seems to be no purpose in life
F47 0340  7    that is sure- no certain guiding principles to give
F47 0350  3    stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and
F47 0350 12    freely, with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere,
F47 0360 10    especially among students. Parents indulge their children.
F47 0370  6       The government has recognized the dilemma and is
F47 0380  7    beginning to devise some moral education for the schools-
F47 0390  4    but the teachers often have no firm conviction and
F47 0400  2    are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that
F47 0400 13    Japanese soldiers would not fight again- for why should
F47 0410  9    they? It will be painful, but interesting, to see what
F47 0420  7    kind of a god these people will create or what strong
F47 0430  5    convictions they will develop.
F47 0430  9       In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers
F47 0440  7    met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I
F47 0450  6    had my first raw fish and found it good. They suggested
F47 0460  3    several new foods, and usually I found them good, except
F47 0470  2    the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six
F47 0470 13    of the science teachers were present, and we had great
F47 0480  9    fun.
F47 0480 10    #KYOTO#
F47 0480 11    After a day at Nikko, Mrs. Kodama put me on the train
F47 0490 12    for Kyoto. My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would
F47 0500  8    meet me at the hotel, but instead he and three others
F47 0510  7    were at the station with a very warm welcome. My hotel
F47 0520  4    rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan
F47 0530  1    Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have
F47 0530 11    chosen, but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did
F47 0540 12    explain to the students, however, that this was not
F47 0550  6    my usual style, for their salaries are very small,
F47 0560  2    and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.
F47 0560 15    They understood and teased me a bit about it.
F47 0570  9       I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan
F47 0580  6    if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, and Hiroshima. Kyoto
F47 0590  4    is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural
F47 0600  2    center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war-
F47 0605  1    and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of
F47 0610 10    prewar Japan. Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto
F47 0620  7    (Fumio's mother), her son, Mr. Washizu (a prospective
F47 0630  5    student with whom I have been corresponding for more
F47 0640  3    than a year), and Mr. Nishima, one of the science teachers.
F47 0650  2    I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished
F47 0660  2    breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.
F47 0670  1    We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens.
F47 0670 10    We visited the Okamoto home- where for the first time
F47 0680  8    I saw the famous tea ceremony. At 6:00 p.m. we went
F47 0690  6    to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these
F47 0700  3    beautiful dances originated. They were even better
F47 0700 10    than those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.
F47 0710  9       After a supper of unagi (rice with eel- eel which
F47 0720 10    is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji),
F47 0730 10    I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as
F47 0740  7    possible to be ready for another busy day. We started
F47 0750  3    at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu
F47 0760  2    is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital
F47 0760 12    facilities accompanying the medical school. They apologized
F47 0770  7    for the condition, including dirt and flies, and I
F47 0780  7    was a little at a loss to know what to say. There seemed
F47 0790  5    to be no excuse? I don't have the answer yet.
F47 0800  2       We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned
F47 0810  1    that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His
F47 0810 11    grandfather is a Buddhist priest; and he, being the
F47 0820  8    eldest, was supposed to be a priest, but he chose to
F47 0830  5    do differently, and one of his brothers is to become
F47 0840  1    the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for
F47 0840 11    only a few years ago he would have had no choice. In
F47 0850 10    his big home live four families and thirty people,
F47 0860  4    so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed here
F47 0870  2    some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600
F47 0870 10    years old- paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc. He had
F47 0880  9    displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy
F47 0890  8    them. About 100 of the most important items he had
F47 0900  4    already given to the museum. The house itself is 400
F47 0910  1    years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried
F47 0910 11    times.
F47 0920  1    #NARA, OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA#
F47 0920  4    Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara. We passed
F47 0930  5    his house and school on the way. In Nara I stayed at
F47 0940  3    the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed
F47 0940 12    on their honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid
F47 0950  9    for their coming, but I walked on it, too. Here Mr.
F47 0960  7    Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the
F47 0970  4    town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles
F47 0980  1    in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara
F47 0980 12    at night.
F47 0990  1       In the evening both of the men went with me on the
F47 0990 13    train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for
F47 1000 10    Hiroshima. Again the plan was for me to go alone, but
F47 1010  7    they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr. Yoneda had to leave
F47 1020  4    us to get the train to his home, but Mr. Nishima and
F47 1030  2    I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka
F47 1030 15    at night. It is the second largest city in Japan, with
F47 1040 10    about four million people. One spot in Osaka I shall
F47 1050  7    always remember- the bridge where we stood to watch
F47 1060  5    the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the
F47 1070  1    still waters of the river. In the midst of a great
F47 1070 12    busy city, people take time to enjoy the beauty of
F47 1080  8    natural reflection of artificial light.
F47 1090  1       My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour
F47 1090 10    of 4:45 a.m. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi
F47 1100 12    and sleep a little, after which Mr. Uno would arrive
F47 1110  7    and pilot me around. But there he was at the train
F47 1120  6    with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.
F47 1130  1       I know now why the students insisted that I go to
F47 1130 12    Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to. They
F47 1140 10    knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event,
F47 1150  5    and they felt that if I could see the recovery and
F47 1170  2    the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who
F47 1170 13    also regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would
F47 1180 10    understand better a new Japan. There were no words
F47 1190  8    to say this but there was no need.
F47 1200  1       The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small
F47 1200 11    gift to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better
F47 1210 10    city than it was before- in the minds of the people
F47 1220  9    I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding.
F47 1230  3    I was grateful for their insight into my need for this
F47 1240  3    experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima.
F47 1250  1    #TOKYO#
F47 1250  2    On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who
F47 1250 13    took us immediately to her university, the Japanese
F47 1260  8    Women's University. This day was "Open House for Parents"
F47 1270  8    day, and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and
F47 1280  5    arranging tea tables. Everything was in an exciting
F47 1290  3    turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.
F47 1290  9       It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained
F47 1300 10    teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning.
F47 1310  8    Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan
F47 1320  5    who is trying to plan homes around family functions
F47 1330  2    and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come
F47 1330 13    when women will find it necessary to do most of their
F47 1340 11    own work, and even now it is important to have conveniences
F47 1350  7    for the use of servants. Many of the features of the
F47 1360  6    homes are the latest modern devices in American homes,
F47 1370  2    but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using
F47 1370 11    Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture
F47 1390  7    at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western
F47 1400  5    utility patterns.
F47 1400  7       At this Women's University we find a monument to
F47 1410  7    a courageous family who believed that Japanese women
F47 1420  4    also should be educated. Even today there are some
F47 1430  2    doubts about the value of education for Japanese women,
F47 1430 11    but this University continues to grow and to send its
F47 1440  9    students out into the community. Active alumnae have
F47 1450  5    built a fine building on the campus where members can
F47 1460  4    come and stay for a few days or longer and where they
F47 1470  1    can have their social gatherings and professional meetings.
F47 1470  9    As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling
F47 1480  9    up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which
F47 1490  5    are needed in the world are going to be found by educated
F47 1500  3    women unafraid to break traditions.
F47 1500  8       Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored
F47 1510  6    school for Japanese widows in Tokyo. Here the women
F47 1520  4    learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled in
F47 1530  2    cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They
F47 1530 10    learn how to take care of children and sick members
F47 1540  9    of the family. They have model kitchens, a sick room
F47 1550  5    with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with a life-like
F47 1560  4    doll. Although the training is only for one month,
F47 1560 13    it is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's
F47 1570  9    school are much in demand and can always find work
F47 1580  8    immediately. Occasionally they return for additional
F47 1590  3    training. Masu's home economics training comes into
F47 1600  2    play as she designs cupboards along modern functional
F47 1600 10    lines for the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also
F47 1610  8    uses the training she got in an American home where
F47 1620  6    she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, and
F47 1630  2    work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education
F47 1630 11    in the United States, not just in a classroom, but
F47 1640 10    also in an American house with an American housekeeper,
F47 1650  6    stands her in good stead.
F47 1650 11    #UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO#
F47 1660  3    After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen
F47 1670  1    of which Masu had planned, Mr. Washizu and I left to
F47 1670 12    meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the
F47 1680  9    University of Tokyo. Here again it was vacation time
F47 1690  7    and there were many things I could not see, but I was
F47 1700  6    able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese
F47 1710  3    circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.
