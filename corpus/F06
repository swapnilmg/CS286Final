F06 0010  1    Are you retiring now? If so, are you saying, "Where
F06 0010 11    did the last few years go? How did I get to be sixty-five
F06 0020 12    so fast? What do I do now"?
F06 0030  4       Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.
F06 0040  1    Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire.
F06 0040 11    We always thought we would die with our boots on. Out
F06 0050 10    of the blue comes talk of pension plans. Compulsory
F06 0060  5    retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon. Still,
F06 0070  3    it seems in the far future. Suddenly, one day, up it
F06 0080  1    pops! Sixty-five years and you've had it!
F06 0080  9       So, now what? Oh sure! You've thought about it before
F06 0090  8    in a hazy sort of way. But! It never seemed real; never
F06 0100  7    seemed as if it could happen to you; only to the other
F06 0110  7    fellow.
F06 0110  8       Now! Here it is! How am I going to live? What am
F06 0120  8    I going to do? Where do I go from here?
F06 0130  2       A great many retired people are the so-called white
F06 0140  1    collar workers. Are you one of these?
F06 0140  8       If so, you are of the old school. You are conscientious,
F06 0150  6    hard working, honest, accurate, a good penman, and
F06 0160  5    a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.
F06 0170  1    Everything must balance to the last penny. Also you
F06 0170 10    can spell, without consulting a dictionary for every
F06 0180  6    other word. You never are late for work and seldom
F06 0190  5    absent.
F06 0190  6    ##
F06 0190  7    Actually, you can take no special credit for this.
F06 0200  4    It is the way you were taught and your way of life.
F06 0210  2    All this is standard equipment for a man of your day;
F06 0210 13    your stock in trade; your livelihood.
F06 0220  5       However, the last few years of your life, things
F06 0230  5    seem to be changing. Your way doesn't seem to be so
F06 0240  3    darned important any more. You realize you are getting
F06 0240 12    in the old fogy class. To put it bluntly, you are getting
F06 0250 10    out-moded.
F06 0260  1       What's happened? The answer is a new era.
F06 0260  8       Now, looming on the horizon are such things as estimated
F06 0270  8    totals, calculated risks and I.B.M. machines. The Planning
F06 0280  5    Dept. comes into existence. All sorts of plans come
F06 0290  6    to life. This is followed by a boom in conferences.
F06 0300  1    Yes sir! Conferences become very popular. When a plan
F06 0310  1    burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary
F06 0310  9    patch, and life goes merrily on. That's called progress!
F06 0320  7    The new way of life! Let's face it! You had your day
F06 0330  8    and it was a good day. Let this generation have theirs.
F06 0340  4    Time marches on!
F06 0340  7       Well, to get back to the problem of retirement.
F06 0350  6    Every retiring person has a different situation facing
F06 0360  3    him. Some have plenty of money- some have very little
F06 0370  1    money. Some are blest with an abundance of good health-
F06 0370 11    some are in poor health and many are invalids. Some
F06 0380 10    have lovely homes- some live in small apartments. Some
F06 0390  7    have beautiful gardens- some not even a blade of grass.
F06 0400  6    Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept what
F06 0410  2    they have, and make the most of it (a wonderful gift
F06 0410 13    to have, believe me)- some see only darkness, the bitter
F06 0420  9    side of everything. Well, whatever you have, that's
F06 0430  6    it! You've got to learn to live with it.
F06 0440  4       Now! The question is "How are you going to live
F06 0450  2    with it"?
F06 0450  4    ##
F06 0450  5    You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot. Yes!
F06 0460  3    You can do this. But, if you do, your life will be
F06 0470  2    just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.
F06 0470  9       It seems to me, the first thing you've got to do,
F06 0480 11    to be happy, is to face up to your problems, no matter
F06 0490  8    what they may be. Make up your mind to pool your resources
F06 0500  5    and get the most out of your remaining years of life.
F06 0510  3    One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in
F06 0510 15    life. You've got to do something.
F06 0520  6       Many of you will say, "Well, what can I do"?
F06 0530  5       Believe me! There are many, many things to do. Find
F06 0540  4    out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.
F06 0550  1    If you can't think of a thing to do, try something-
F06 0550 12    anything. Maybe you will surprise yourself.
F06 0560  6       True! We are not all great artists. I, frankly,
F06 0570  4    can't draw a straight line. Maybe you are not that
F06 0580  3    gifted either, but how about puttering around with
F06 0580 11    the old paints? You may amaze yourself and acquire
F06 0590  7    a real knack for it. Anyway, I'll bet you have a lot
F06 0600  7    of fun.
F06 0600  9       Do you like to sew? Does making your own clothes
F06 0610  5    or even doll clothes, interest you? Do you love to
F06 0620  4    run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes?
F06 0620 14    If you do, go to it. There is always a market for this
F06 0630 13    line of work. Some women can sit and sew, crochet,
F06 0640  7    tat or knit by the hour, and look calm and relaxed
F06 0650  4    and turn out beautiful work. Where sewing is concerned,
F06 0660  1    I'm a total loss. When you see a needle in my hands
F06 0660 13    you will know the family buttons have fallen off and
F06 0670  9    I have to sew them back on, or get out the safety pins.
F06 0680  7       Then again, there's always that lovely old pastime
F06 0690  4    of hooking or braiding rugs. Not for me, but perhaps
F06 0700  1    just the thing for you.
F06 0700  6       Well! How's about mosaic tile, ceramics or similar
F06 0710  5    arts and crafts? Some people love to crack tile and
F06 0720  4    it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with
F06 0730  1    as a result of their cracking good time.
F06 0730  9       How about the art of cooking? Do you yearn to make
F06 0740  7    cakes and pies, or special cookies and candies? There
F06 0750  4    is always an open market for this sort of delicacy,
F06 0760  1    in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and
F06 0760 10    hands-off-all-sweets
F06 0770  1    to the contrary.
F06 0770  4       Some people can carve most anything out of a piece
F06 0780  4    of wood. Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests,
F06 0780 12    doll houses, etc. Perhaps you couldn't do that but
F06 0800  7    have you ever tried to see what you could do with a
F06 0810  9    hunk of wood? Outside of cutting your fingers, maybe
F06 0820  3    you would come up with nothing at all, but then again,
F06 0830  1    you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.
F06 0830  9       Some women get a real thrill out of housework. They
F06 0840  8    love to dust, scrub, polish, wax floors, move the furniture
F06 0850  6    around from place to place, take down the curtains,
F06 0860  2    put up new ones and have themselves a real ball. Maybe
F06 0860 13    that's your forte. It certainly isn't mine. I can look
F06 0870 10    at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really
F06 0880 11    feel for sure that's where it belongs.
F06 0890  4    ##
F06 0890  5    Perhaps you would like to become a writer. This gives
F06 0900  3    you a wide and varied choice. Will it be short stories,
F06 0910  1    fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's
F06 0910  6    stories, or even a book if you are really ambitious?
F06 0920  8       Ever since I was a child, I have always had a yen
F06 0930  8    to try my hand at writing. If you do decide to write,
F06 0940  4    you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips
F06 0950  1    and dejection. Don't be discouraged! This is just being
F06 0950 10    a normal writer. Just let the rejection slips fall
F06 0960  8    where they may, and keep on plugging, and finally you
F06 0970  6    will make the grade. Few new writers have their first
F06 0980  3    story accepted, so they tell me. But, it could happen,
F06 0990  1    and it may happen to you.
F06 0990  7       Then there's always hobbies, collecting stamps,
F06 1000  2    coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants,
F06 1010  1    dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting
F06 1010 10    anything your heart desires?
F06 1020  2       I can hear some of you folks protesting. You say,
F06 1030  1    "But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby. I haven't
F06 1030 14    got that kind of money".
F06 1040  4       True! It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies
F06 1050  3    but there are hobbies that are for free. How about
F06 1050 13    a rock collection, or a collection of leaves from different
F06 1060  9    trees or shrubs and in different colors? Then, take
F06 1070  7    flowers. They are many and varied. Also, there's scrap
F06 1080  4    books, collecting newspaper pictures and clippings,
F06 1090  2    or any items of interest to you. It's getting interested
F06 1100  1    in something that counts.
F06 1100  5    ##
F06 1100  6    As for me, I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles
F06 1110  4    (I love puzzles) to put together when time hangs heavy
F06 1120  2    on my hands. So far, the covers have never been off
F06 1120 13    the boxes. I just don't have time to do half the things
F06 1130 12    I want to do now.
F06 1140  1       So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise
F06 1140  9    you to make the most of each day, enjoy each one to
F06 1150 10    the n'th degree. Travel, if you can. Keep occupied
F06 1160  6    to the point you are not bored with life and you will
F06 1170  4    truly find these final days and years of your lives
F06 1170 14    to be sunshine sweet.
F06 1180  4       Good Luck! To one and all- Good Days ahead! An important
F06 1200  3    criterion of maturity is creativity. The mature person
F06 1210  1    is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term
F06 1210 12    we hear with increasing frequency these days? When
F06 1220  5    we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual.
F06 1230  5    "To be creative is to have the ability to cause to
F06 1240  3    exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring
F06 1240 12    forth an original production of human intelligence
F06 1250  7    or power". We are creative, it seems, when we produce
F06 1260  6    something which has not previously existed. Thus creativity
F06 1270  3    may run all the way from making a cake, building a
F06 1280  2    chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business,
F06 1280 12    creating a League of Nations or, developing a mature
F06 1290  9    character.
F06 1290 10       All living creatures from the lowest form of insect
F06 1300  9    or animal life evidence the power of creativity, if
F06 1310  6    it is only to reproduce a form like their own. While
F06 1320  3    man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors
F06 1330  1    in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal
F06 1330 10    with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative
F06 1340  6    ability. An animal, bird or insect creates either a
F06 1350  5    burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness according
F06 1360  2    to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary
F06 1370  1    forbears is in the development of his imagination.
F06 1370  9    This gives him the power to form in his mind new image
F06 1380  9    combinations of old memories, ideas and experiences
F06 1390  3    and to project them outside of himself into his environment
F06 1400  1    in new and ever-changing forms.
F06 1400  7    ##
F06 1400  8    It has been truly said that anything man can imagine
F06 1410  6    he can produce or create by projecting this inner image
F06 1420  4    into its counterpart in the objective world. In our
F06 1430  1    own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of
F06 1430 11    a Jules Verne come into actuality. The vision of a
F06 1440  8    Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took
F06 1450  6    visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941.
F06 1460  2    In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant
F06 1460 12    of man's projection of his imagination over the past
F06 1470  8    60 centuries or more. It is in this one aspect, at
F06 1480  7    least, that man seems to be made in the image of his
F06 1490  3    Creator.
F06 1490  4       Not only can man project his imagination out into
F06 1500  3    his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly,
F06 1510  1    he can turn it inward to help create new and better
F06 1510 12    forms of himself. We recognize that young people through
F06 1520  7    imaginative mind and body training can become athletes,
F06 1530  4    acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing
F06 1540  1    many potentialities. We know that actors can learn
F06 1540  9    to portray a wide variety of character roles. By this
F06 1550  9    same combination of the will and the imagination, each
F06 1560  6    one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind
F06 1570  3    of character we would like to be. We must realize with
F06 1580  1    Prof. Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man
F06 1580 11    is the being that can continually remake himself, the
F06 1590  8    artisan that is himself the material for his own creation".
F06 1600  7    ##
F06 1600  8    So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied
F06 1610  7    with projecting things into his environment rather
F06 1620  2    than first creating the sort of person who can make
F06 1630  1    the highest use of the things he has created. Is not
F06 1630 12    the present world crisis a race between things we have
F06 1640  8    created which can now destroy us and between populations
F06 1650  4    of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the
F06 1660  2    tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens
F06 1660 12    to lend our weight to being creative on the character
F06 1670  9    side and to hasten our own maturing process?
F06 1680  4       Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS OF MAN
F06 1690  3    makes the novel point that just as man is unique in
F06 1700  1    being the only animal which requires a long period
F06 1700 10    of infancy and childhood under family protection, so
F06 1710  5    is he the only animal who has a long period after the
F06 1720  4    decline of his procreativity.
