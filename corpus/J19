J19 0010  1    #7-1. EXAMPLES OF BINOMIAL EXPERIMENTS#
J19 0010  7    Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent
J19 0020  5    trials, each with two possible outcomes. The binomial
J19 0030  4    probability distribution may describe the variation
J19 0040  1    that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial
J19 0040 12    experiment to another. We devote a chapter to the binomial
J19 0050 10    distribution not only because it is a mathematical
J19 0060  7    model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena,
J19 0070  3    but also because it has important properties that recur
J19 0080  1    in many other probability models. We begin with a few
J19 0080 11    examples of binomial experiments.
J19 0090  3    _MARKSMANSHIP EXAMPLE._
J19 0090  5       A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target,
J19 0110  7    all under practically the same conditions, may hit
J19 0120  3    the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times. In repeated sets
J19 0120 14    of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary. What
J19 0130 10    can we say of the probabilities of the different possible
J19 0140  6    numbers of bull's-eyes?
J19 0150  1    _INHERITANCE IN MICE._
J19 0150  4       In litters of eight mice from similar parents, the
J19 0160  2    number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is
J19 0160 12    an integer from 0 to 8. What probabilities should be
J19 0170  9    attached to these possible outcomes?
J19 0180  2    _ACES (ONES) WITH THREE DICE._
J19 0180  7       When three dice are tossed repeatedly, what is the
J19 0190  6    probability that the number of aces is 0 (or 1, or
J19 0200  5    2, or 3)?
J19 0200  8    _GENERAL BINOMIAL PROBLEM._
J19 0200 11       More generally, suppose that an experiment consists
J19 0210  6    of a number of independent trials, that each trial
J19 0220  4    results in either a "success" or a "non-success" ("failure"),
J19 0230  2    and that the probability of success remains constant
J19 0240  1    from trial to trial. In the examples above, the occurrence
J19 0240 11    of a bull's-eye, a straight-haired mouse, or an ace
J19 0260  8    could be called a "success". In general, any outcome
J19 0270  5    we choose may be labeled "success".
J19 0280  1       The major question in this chapter is: What is the
J19 0280 11    probability of exactly x successes in n trials?
J19 0300  1       In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those
J19 0300 10    in the examples, usually by counting points in a sample
J19 0310  8    space. Fortunately, a general formula of wide applicability
J19 0320  5    solves all problems of this kind. Before deriving this
J19 0330  3    formula, we explain what we mean by "problems of this
J19 0340  1    kind".
J19 0340  2       Experiments are often composed of several identical
J19 0350  1    trials, and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated.
J19 0350  8    In the marksmanship example, a trial consists of "one
J19 0360  7    round shot at a target" with outcome either one bull's-eye
J19 0370  7    (success) or none (failure). Further, an experiment
J19 0380  4    might consist of five rounds, and several sets of five
J19 0390  3    rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed
J19 0390 12    of several repetitions of the five-round experiment.
J19 0400  7    If three dice are tossed, a trial is one toss of one
J19 0410  8    die and the experiment is composed of three trials.
J19 0420  3    Or, what amounts to the same thing, if one die is tossed
J19 0430  1    three times, each toss is a trial, and the three tosses
J19 0430 12    form the experiment. Mathematically, we shall not distinguish
J19 0440  6    the experiment of three dice tossed once from that
J19 0450  7    of one die tossed three times. These examples are illustrative
J19 0460  4    of the use of the words "trial" and "experiment" as
J19 0470  2    they are used in this chapter, but they are quite flexible
J19 0480  1    words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly.
J19 0490  1    _EXAMPLE 1. STUDENT FOOTBALL MANAGERS._
J19 0490  5       Ten students act as managers for a high-school football
J19 0500  5    team, and of these managers a proportion p are licensed
J19 0510  3    drivers. Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to
J19 0520  1    stay late and load the equipment on a truck. On three
J19 0520 12    Fridays the coach has needed a driver. Considering
J19 0530  6    only these Fridays, what is the probability that the
J19 0540  4    coach had drivers all 3 times? Exactly 2 times? 1 time?
J19 0550  3    0 time?
J19 0550  5    _DISCUSSION._
J19 0550  6       Note that there are 3 trials of interest. Each trial
J19 0560  5    consists of choosing a student manager at random. The
J19 0570  3    2 possible outcomes on each trial are "driver" or "nondriver".
J19 0580  1    Since the choice is by lot each week, the outcomes
J19 0580 11    of different trials are independent. The managers stay
J19 0590  8    the same, so that **f is the same for all weeks. We
J19 0600  9    now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments.
J19 0610  3       For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment,
J19 0620  3    it must have four properties: (1) there must be a fixed
J19 0630  4    number of trials, (2) each trial must result in a "success"
J19 0640  1    or a "failure" (a binomial trial), (3) all trials must
J19 0640 11    have identical probabilities of success, (4) the trials
J19 0650  8    must be independent of each other. Below we use our
J19 0660  8    earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four
J19 0670  3    properties. We also give, for each property, an example
J19 0680  1    where the property is absent. The language and notation
J19 0680 10    introduced are standard throughout the chapter.
J19 0700  1    _1. THERE MUST BE A FIXED NUMBER N OF REPEATED TRIALS._
J19 0700  6       For the marksman, we study sets of five shots (**f);
J19 0710  5    for the mice, we restrict attention to litters of eight
J19 0730  3    (**f); and for the aces, we toss three dice (**f).
J19 0750  1    _EXPERIMENT WITHOUT A FIXED NUMBER OF TRIALS._
J19 0750  7       Toss a die until an ace appears. Here the number
J19 0760  4    of trials is a random variable, not a fixed number.
J19 0770  1    _2. BINOMIAL TRIALS._
J19 0770  4       Each of the n trials is either a success or a failure.
J19 0780  4    "Success" and "failure" are just convenient labels
J19 0790  2    for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about
J19 0790 12    binomial trials in general. These words are more expressive
J19 0800  9    than labels like "A" and "not-A". It is natural from
J19 0810  9    the marksman's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success,
J19 0830  9    but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category
J19 0840  6    corresponds to straight hair in a mouse. The word "binomial"
J19 0850  4    means "of two names" or "of two terms", and both usages
J19 0860  4    apply in our work: the first to the names of the two
J19 0870  2    outcomes of a binomial trial, and the second to the
J19 0870 12    terms p and **f that represent the probabilities of
J19 0880  8    "success" and "failure". Sometimes when there are many
J19 0890  6    outcomes for a single trial, we group these outcomes
J19 0900  5    into two classes, as in the example of the die, where
J19 0910  2    we have arbitrarily constructed the classes "ace" and
J19 0910 10    "not-ace".
J19 0920  1    _EXPERIMENT WITHOUT THE TWO-CLASS PROPERTY._
J19 0920  7       We classify mice as "straight-haired" or "wavy-haired",
J19 0930  8    but a hairless mouse appears. We can escape from such
J19 0940  8    a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting
J19 0950  5    a trial, but such a solution is not always satisfactory.
J19 0970  1    _3. ALL TRIALS HAVE IDENTICAL PROBABILITIES OF SUCCESS._
J19 0970  1       Each die has probability **f of producing an ace;
J19 0970 10    the marksman has some probability p, perhaps 0.1,
J19 0980  7    of making a bull's-eye. Note that we need not know
J19 0990  7    the value of p, for the experiment to be binomial.
J19 1000  4    _EXPERIMENT WHERE P IS NOT CONSTANT._
J19 1000 10       During a round of target practice the sun comes
J19 1010  9    from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman, lowering
J19 1020  4    his chance of a bull's-eye.
J19 1030  1    _4. THE TRIALS ARE INDEPENDENT._
J19 1030  4       Strictly speaking, this means that the probability
J19 1040  1    for each possible outcome of the experiment can be
J19 1040 10    computed by multiplying together the probabilities
J19 1050  5    of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials.
J19 1060  4    Thus in the three-dice example **f, **f, and the independence
J19 1070  3    assumption implies that the probability that the three
J19 1080  1    dice fall ace, not-ace, ace in that order is (1/6)(5/6)(1/6).
J19 1080 12    Experimentally, we expect independence when the trials
J19 1090  7    have nothing to do with one another.
J19 1100  5    _EXAMPLES WHERE INDEPENDENCE FAILS._
J19 1100  9       A family of five plans to go together either to
J19 1110  9    the beach or to the mountains, and a coin is tossed
J19 1120  6    to decide. We want to know the number of people going
J19 1130  2    to the mountains. When this experiment is viewed as
J19 1130 11    composed of five binomial trials, one for each member
J19 1140  9    of the family, the outcomes of the trials are obviously
J19 1150  6    not independent. Indeed, the experiment is better viewed
J19 1160  4    as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire
J19 1170  1    family. The following is a less extreme example of
J19 1170 10    dependence. Consider couples visiting an art museum.
J19 1180  6    Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to
J19 1190  4    receive a popular prize. Voting for one picture may
J19 1200  1    be called "success", for the other "failure". An experiment
J19 1210  1    consists of the voting of one couple, or two trials.
J19 1210 11    In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple,
J19 1220  8    the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree
J19 1230  6    more often than independence would imply, because couples
J19 1240  2    who visit the museum together are more likely to have
J19 1240 12    similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn
J19 1250 10    from the entire population of visitors. Table 7-1 illustrates
J19 1260  7    the point. The table shows that 0.6 of the boys and
J19 1270  7    0.6 of the girls vote for picture A. Therefore, under
J19 1280  3    independent voting, **f or 0.36 of the couples would
J19 1290  1    cast two votes for picture A, and **f or 0.16 would
J19 1290 12    cast two votes for picture B. Thus in independent
J19 1300  9    voting, **f or 0.52 of the couples would agree. But
J19 1320  7    Table 7-1 shows that **f or 0.70 agree, too many for
J19 1330  4    independent voting.
J19 1330  6       Each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment
J19 1340  3    results in some whole number from 0 through n as the
J19 1350  5    value of the random variable X, where **f. We want
J19 1360  4    to study the probability function of this random variable.
J19 1370  1    For example, we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes,
J19 1380  1    not which shots were bull's-eyes. A binomial experiment
J19 1380 10    can produce random variables other than the number
J19 1390  7    of successes. For example, the marksman gets 5 shots,
J19 1400  5    but we take his score to be the number of shots before
J19 1410  2    his first bull's-eye, that is, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5,
J19 1410 15    if he gets no bull's-eye). Thus we do not score the
J19 1420 12    number of bull's-eyes, and the random variable is not
J19 1430  7    the number of successes.
J19 1440  1       The constancy of p and the independence are the
J19 1440  9    conditions most likely to give trouble in practice.
J19 1450  7    Obviously, very slight changes in p do not change
J19 1460  6    the probabilities much, and a slight lack of independence
J19 1470  2    may not make an appreciable difference. (For instance,
J19 1480  1    see Example 2 of Section 5-5, on red cards in hands
J19 1480 13    of 5.) On the other hand, even when the binomial model
J19 1490  8    does not describe well the physical phenomenon being
J19 1500  3    studied, the binomial model may still be used as a
J19 1510  3    baseline for comparative purposes; that is, we may
J19 1510 11    discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from
J19 1520  8    the binomial model.
J19 1530  1    _TO SUMMARIZE:_
J19 1530  2       A binomial experiment consists of **f independent
J19 1540  1    binomial trials, all with the same probability **f
J19 1540  9    of yielding a success. The outcome of the experiment
J19 1550  6    is X successes. The random variable X takes the values
J19 1560  6    **f with probabilities **f or, more briefly **f.
J19 1570  3       We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly
J19 1580  2    x successes for given values of p and n. When each
J19 1600  2    number of successes x is paired with its probability
J19 1600 11    of occurrence **f, the set of pairs **f, is a probability
J19 1620 11    function called a binomial distribution. The choice
J19 1630  6    of p and n determines the binomial distribution uniquely,
J19 1640  5    and different choices always produce different distributions
J19 1650  4    (except when **f; then the number of successes is always
J19 1660  5    0). The set of all binomial distributions is called
J19 1670  2    the family of binomial distributions, but in general
J19 1670 10    discussions this expression is often shortened to "the
J19 1690  8    binomial distribution", or even "the binomial" when
J19 1700  6    the context is clear. Binomial distributions were treated
J19 1710  3    by James Bernoulli about 1700, and for this reason
J19 1720  2    binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials.
J19 1720  9    _RANDOM VARIABLES._
J19 1730  2       Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces
J19 1740  1    either 0 or 1 success. Therefore each binomial trial
J19 1740 10    can be thought of as producing a value of a random
J19 1750  9    variable associated with that trial and taking the
J19 1760  5    values 0 and 1, with probabilities q and p respectively.
J19 1770  3    The several trials of a binomial experiment produce
J19 1780  2    a new random variable X, the total number of successes,
J19 1790  1    which is just the sum of the random variables associated
J19 1790 11    with the single trials.
J19 1800  2    _EXAMPLE 2._
J19 1800  4       The marksman gets two bull's-eyes, one on his third
J19 1810  4    shot and one on his fifth. The numbers of successes
J19 1810 14    on the five individual shots are, then, 0, 0, 1, 0,
J19 1820 11    1. The number of successes on each shot is a value
J19 1830  7    of a random variable that has values 0 or 1, and there
J19 1840  5    are 5 such random variables here. Their sum is X,
J19 1850  1    the total number of successes, which in this experiment
J19 1850 10    has the value **f.
