C17 0010  1       The reading public, the theatergoing public, the
C17 0010  8    skindiving public, the horse-playing public- all these
C17 0020  6    and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life, but
C17 0030  5    none is so varied, vast and vigilant as the eating
C17 0040  1    public. The Department of Agriculture averaged out
C17 0040  8    U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person,
C17 0050 10    which, allowing for the 17 million Americans that John
C17 0060  8    Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night, means that
C17 0070  5    certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down
C17 0080  2    8 lbs. or more a day. That mother hen of the weight-height
C17 0090  1    tables, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., clucks
C17 0090  8    that 48 million Americans are overweight.
C17 0100  4       Through previous centuries, eating changed by nearly
C17 0110  4    imperceptible degrees, and mostly toward just getting
C17 0120  2    enough. Now big forces buffet food. For the first time
C17 0120 12    in history, the U.S. has produced a society in which
C17 0130  9    less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much
C17 0140  8    food that the Government's most embarrassing problem
C17 0150  3    is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons
C17 0160  2    of surplus farm produce. In this same society, the
C17 0160 11    plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth
C17 0170  9    his income buy more calories than he can consume. Refrigeration,
C17 0180  5    automated processing and packaging conspire to defy
C17 0190  4    season and banish spoilage. And in the wake of the
C17 0190 14    new affluence and the new techniques of processing
C17 0200  8    comes a new American interest in how what people eat
C17 0210  7    affects their health. To eat is human, the nation is
C17 0220  4    learning to think, to survive divine.
C17 0220 10    #FADS, FACTS **H#
C17 0230  2    Not all the concern for health is well directed. From
C17 0230 12    the fusty panaceas of spinach, eggs and prunes, the
C17 0240  8    U.S. has progressed to curds, concentrates and capsules.
C17 0250  6    Each year, reports the American Medical Association,
C17 0260  3    ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins,
C17 0270  2    tonics and other food supplements. At juice bars in
C17 0270 11    Los Angeles' 35 "health" stores, a new sensation is
C17 0280  9    a pink, high-protein cocktail, concocted of dried eggs,
C17 0290  6    powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal, which sells
C17 0300  5    for 59@ per 8-oz. glass. Grocery stores sell dozens
C17 0310  3    of foods that boast of having almost no food value
C17 0310 13    at all.
C17 0320  1       But a big part of the public wants to know facts
C17 0320 12    about diet and health, and a big group of U.S. scientists
C17 0330 10    wants to supply them. The man most firmly at grips
C17 0340  8    with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist
C17 0350  4    Ancel Keys, 57, inventor of the wartime K (for Keys)
C17 0360  4    ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well
C17 0370  3    and Stay Well. From his birch-paneled office in the
C17 0380  1    Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, under the university's
C17 0380  8    football stadium in Minneapolis ("We get a rumble on
C17 0390  9    every touchdown"), blocky, grey-haired Dr. Keys directs
C17 0400  7    an ambitious, $200,000-a-year experiment on diet, which
C17 0410  5    spans three continents and seven nations and is still
C17 0420  4    growing. Pursuing it, he has logged 500,000 miles,
C17 0420 12    suffered indescribable digestive indignities, and meticulously
C17 0430  6    collected physiological data on the health and eating
C17 0440  8    habits of 10,000 individuals, from Bantu tribesmen
C17 0450  4    to Italian contadini. He has measured the skinfolds
C17 0460  3    (the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades) of Neapolitan
C17 0470  1    firemen, studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters,
C17 0470  8    analyzed the "mealie-meal" eaten by Capetown coloreds,
C17 0480  8    and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen.
C17 0490  4    #**H AND FATS.#
C17 0490  7    Keys's findings, though far from complete, are likely
C17 0510  7    to smash many an eating cliche. Vitamins, eggs and
C17 0520  4    milk begin to look like foods to hold down on (though
C17 0530  1    mothers' milk is still the ticket). Readings of the
C17 0530 10    number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood, which
C17 0540  7    seem to have value in predicting heart attacks, are
C17 0550  4    becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram, which
C17 0560  2    can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic
C17 0560 11    attack. Already many an American knows his count, and
C17 0570  8    rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer
C17 0580  6    180 (safe) or 250 (dangerous).
C17 0580 11       Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so
C17 0590  8    far:
C17 0590  9       @ Americans eat too much. The typical U.S. daily
C17 0600  8    menu, says Dr. Keys, contains 3,000 calories, should
C17 0610  6    contain 2,300. And extra weight increases the risk
C17 0620  4    of cancer, diabetes, artery disease and heart attack.
C17 0630  1       @ Americans eat too much fat. With meat, milk, butter
C17 0640  1    and ice cream, the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat,
C17 0640 12    and most of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind,
C17 0650  9    says Dr. Keys, that increases blood cholesterol, damages
C17 0660  6    arteries, and leads to coronary disease.
C17 0670  2    #OBESITY: A MALNUTRITION.#
C17 0670  5    Throughout much of the world, food is still so scarce
C17 0680  7    that half of the earth's population has trouble getting
C17 0690  4    the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.
C17 0700  1    The deficiency diseases- scurvy, tropical sprue, pellagra-
C17 0700  8    run rampant. In West Africa, for example, where meat
C17 0710  9    is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make
C17 0720  7    room at the breast for later arrivals, a childhood
C17 0730  3    menace is kwashiorkor, or "red Johnny", a growth-stunting
C17 0740  1    protein deficiency (signs: reddish hair, bloated belly)
C17 0750  1    that kills more than half its victims, leaves the rest
C17 0750 11    prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease.
C17 0760  5       In the well-fed U.S., deficiency diseases have virtually
C17 0770  5    vanished in the past 20 years. Today, as Harrison's
C17 0780  3    Principles of Internal Medicine, a standard internist's
C17 0790  2    text, puts it, "The most common form of malnutrition
C17 0800  1    is caloric excess or obesity".
C17 0800  6       Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant
C17 0810  5    symbol of intemperance, and thus a sin. Says Keys:
C17 0820  2    "Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is
C17 0820 12    immoral, the fat man would start to think". Morals
C17 0830  9    aside, the fat man has plenty to worry about- over
C17 0840  7    and above the fact that no one any longer loves him.
C17 0850  4    The simple mechanical strain of overweight, says New
C17 0860  1    York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe, can overburden and damage
C17 0860  9    the heart "for much the same reason that a Chevrolet
C17 0870 10    engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than
C17 0880  7    if it were in a body for which it was built". The fat
C17 0890  5    man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay
C17 0900  2    higher premiums. He has- for unclear reasons- a 25%
C17 0900 11    higher death rate from cancer. He is particularly vulnerable
C17 0910  9    to diabetes. He may find even moderate physical exertion
C17 0920  7    uncomfortable, because excess body fat hampers his
C17 0930  5    breathing and restricts his muscular movement.
C17 0940  1       Physiologically, people overeat because what Dr.
C17 0940  7    Jolliffe calls the "appestat" is set too high. The
C17 0950  9    appestat, which adjusts the appetite to keep weight
C17 0960  6    constant, is located, says Jolliffe, in the hypothalamus-
C17 0970  4    near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance
C17 0980  1    controls. Physical exercise raises the appestat. So
C17 0980  8    does cold weather. In moderate doses, alcohol narcotizes
C17 0990  7    the appestat and enhances appetite (the original reason
C17 1000  5    for the cocktail); but because liquor has a high caloric
C17 1010  5    value- 100 calories per oz.- the heavy drinker is seldom
C17 1020  4    hungry. In rare cases, diseases such as encephalitis
C17 1030  1    or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently,
C17 1030 10    destroying nearly all sense of satiety.
C17 1040  6    #FOOD FOR FRUSTRATION.#
C17 1040  9    Far more frequently, overeating is the result of a
C17 1055  6    psychological compulsion. It may be fostered by frustration,
C17 1060  6    depression, insecurity- or, in children, simply by
C17 1070  3    the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging. Some
C17 1080  1    families place undue emphasis on food: conversations
C17 1080  8    center on it, and rich delicacies are offered as rewards,
C17 1090  8    withheld as punishment. The result says Jolliffe: "The
C17 1100  5    child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of
C17 1110  5    life". Food may act as a sedative, giving temporary
C17 1120  1    emotional solace, just as, for some people, alcohol
C17 1120  9    does. Reports Dr. Keys: "A fairly common experience
C17 1130  7    for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out
C17 1140  6    more and more. He may be interested in another woman,
C17 1150  3    or just like being with the boys. So she fishes around
C17 1160  1    in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake. It's
C17 1160 11    a matter of boredom, and the subconscious feeling that
C17 1170  7    she is entitled to something, because she's being deprived
C17 1180  5    of something else".
C17 1180  8       For the army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers
C17 1190  8    and the gobblers to the downright gluttons- reducing
C17 1200  5    is a war with the will that is rarely won. Physiologist
C17 1210  3    Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as
C17 1220  2    the amphetamines (Benzedrine, Dexedrine) as dangerous
C17 1225  5    "crutches for a weak will".
C17 1230  5       Keys has no such objections to Metrecal, Quaker
C17 1240  2    Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that
C17 1240 11    are currently winning favor from dieters. "Metrecal
C17 1250  7    is a pretty complete food", he says. "It contains large
C17 1260  7    amounts of protein, vitamins and minerals. In the quantity
C17 1270  6    of 900 calories a day, anyone will lose weight on it-
C17 1280  4    20, 30 or 40 lbs.". But Keys worries that the Metrecal
C17 1290  2    drinker will never make either the psychological or
C17 1290 10    physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller
C17 1300  8    portions of food.
C17 1300 11    #THAT REMARKABLE CHOLESTEROL.#
C17 1310  3    Despite his personal distaste for obesity ("disgusting"),
C17 1320  2    Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much
C17 1330  4    Americans eat. What concerns him much more is the relationship
C17 1340  1    of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer: coronary artery
C17 1340 11    disease, which accounts for more than half of all heart
C17 1350 10    fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year- twice
C17 1360  6    the toll from all varieties of cancer, five times the
C17 1370  5    deaths from automobile accidents.
C17 1370  9       Cholesterol, the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory,
C17 1380  7    is a mysterious yellowish, waxy substance, chemically
C17 1390  4    a crystalline alcohol. Scientists assume that cholesterol
C17 1400  4    (from the Greek chole, meaning bile, and sterios, meaning
C17 1410  3    solid) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain
C17 1420  2    cells, since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's
C17 1420 12    total solid weight. They know it is the chief ingredient
C17 1430 10    in gallstones. They suspect it plays a role in the
C17 1440  8    production of adrenal hormones, and they believe it
C17 1450  4    is essential to the transport of fats throughout the
C17 1460  1    circulatory system. But they cannot fully explain the
C17 1460  9    process of its manufacture by the human liver. Although
C17 1470  7    the fatty protein molecules, carried in the blood and
C17 1480  6    partly composed of cholesterol, are water soluble,
C17 1490  1    cholesterol itself is insoluble, and cannot be destroyed
C17 1490  9    by the body. "A remarkable substance", says Dr. Keys,
C17 1500  8    "quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the
C17 1510  9    walls of arteries".
C17 1520  1       When thus deposited, Keys says that cholesterol
C17 1520  8    is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that
C17 1530  6    culminate in heart attacks. Explains Keys: As the fatty
C17 1540  5    protein molecules travel in the bloodstream, they are
C17 1550  3    deposited in the intima, or inner wall of a coronary
C17 1550 13    artery. The proteins and fats are burned off, and the
C17 1560 10    cholesterol is left behind. As cholesterol piles up,
C17 1570  6    it narrows, irritates and damages the artery, encouraging
C17 1580  3    formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.
C17 1590  1    Eventually, says Keys, one of two things happens. A
C17 1590 10    clot forms at the site, seals off the flow of blood
C17 1600 10    to the heart and provokes a heart attack. Or (more
C17 1610  6    commonly, thinks Keys) the deposits themselves get
C17 1620  2    so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the
C17 1620 13    point that an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated,
C17 1630  9    cells supplied by the artery die, and the heart is
C17 1640  9    permanently, perhaps fatally injured.
C17 1650  1    #FATS + CORONARIES.#
C17 1650  4    Ordinarily, the human liver synthesizes only enough
C17 1660  3    cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation
C17 1670  1    of fats and for production of bile. Even eggs and other
C17 1670 12    cholesterol-rich foods, eaten in normal amounts, says
C17 1680  7    Dr. Keys, do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol
C17 1690  6    in the blood. But fatty foods do.
C17 1700  2       During World War II, doctors in The Netherlands
C17 1710  1    and Scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses
C17 1710 10    of Nazi occupation, the death rate from coronary artery
C17 1720  8    disease was slowly dropping. Not until long after the
C17 1730  6    war- 1950, in fact- did they get a hint of the reason.
C17 1740  6    That year, Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the
C17 1750  3    sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly
C17 1750 10    severe restrictions on fatty foods. That same year
C17 1760  8    the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell,
C17 1770  4    timing oxidation rates of blood fats, stumbled onto
C17 1780  4    the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood
C17 1790  1    cholesterol levels to drop radically, while animal
C17 1790  8    fats cause them to rise. Here Keys and others, such
C17 1800  7    as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute, took
C17 1810  5    over to demonstrate the chemical difference between
C17 1820  2    vegetable and animal fats- and even between different
C17 1830  1    varieties of each.
C17 1830  4       All natural food fats fall into one of three categories-
C17 1840  1    saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated. The
C17 1860  1    degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen
C17 1860 10    atoms on the fat molecule. Saturated fats can accommodate
C17 1870  7    no more hydrogens. Mono-unsaturated fats have room
C17 1880  4    for two more hydrogens on each molecule, and the poly-unsaturated
C17 1890  5    fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.
C17 1900  1       The three fats have similar caloric values (about
C17 1900  9    265 calories per oz.), but each exerts a radically
C17 1910  8    different influence on blood cholesterol.
