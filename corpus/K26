K26 0010  1       But they all said, "No, your time will come. Enjoy
K26 0010 11    being a bride while you can".
K26 0020  5       There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning
K26 0030  3    House (where the Albright boys always took their brides,
K26 0040  1    till they could get a house and a farm of their own).
K26 0040 13    So when the Big House filled up and ran over, the sisters-in-law
K26 0050 12    found beds for everyone in their own homes. And there
K26 0060  8    was still not anything that Linda Kay could do.
K26 0070  4       So Linda Kay gave up asking, and accepted her reprieve.
K26 0080  3    Without saying so, she was really grateful; for to
K26 0090  1    attend the dying was something she had never experienced,
K26 0090 10    and certainly had not imagined when she thought of
K26 0100  8    the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife. She
K26 0110  4    had made curtains for all the windows of her little
K26 0120  2    house, and she had kept it spotless and neat, shabby
K26 0120 12    as it was, and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe. She
K26 0130  9    had done all the things she had promised herself she
K26 0140  5    would do, but she had not thought of this. People died,
K26 0150  3    she would have said, in hospitals, or in cars on the
K26 0150 14    highway at night.
K26 0160  3       Bobby Joe was gone all day now, not coming in for
K26 0170  2    dinner and sometimes not for supper. When they first
K26 0170 11    married he had been working in the fields all day,
K26 0180  9    and she would get in the car and drive to wherever
K26 0190  4    he was working, to take him a fresh hot meal. Now there
K26 0200  2    was no work in the fields, nor would there be till
K26 0200 13    it rained, and she did not know where he went. Not
K26 0210 10    that she complained, or had any cause to. Four or five
K26 0220  6    of the cousins from East Texas were about his age,
K26 0230  3    so naturally they ran around together. There was no
K26 0230 12    reason for her to ask what they did.
K26 0240  8       Thus a new pattern of days began to develop, for
K26 0250  4    Granny Albright did not die. She lay still on the bed,
K26 0260  2    her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened
K26 0260 11    her eyes and looked around, and sometimes she took
K26 0270  8    a little milk or soup. They stopped expecting her to
K26 0280  5    die the next minute, but only in the next day or two.
K26 0290  4    Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial
K26 0290 14    would not go home, for she might die any time; but
K26 0300 11    they might as well unpack their suitcases, for she
K26 0310  6    might linger on.
K26 0310  9       So the pattern was established. When Linda Kay had
K26 0320  7    put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum
K26 0330  5    rugs, she would go to the Big House. There was not
K26 0340  3    anything she could do there, but that was where everyone
K26 0340 13    was, or would be. Bobby Joe and the boys would come
K26 0350 11    by, say "How's Granny"? and sit on the porch a while.
K26 0360  8    The older men would be there at noon, and maybe rest
K26 0370  6    for a time before they took their guns off to the creek
K26 0380  4    or drove down the road towards town.
K26 0380 11       The women and children stayed at the Albrights'.
K26 0390  6    The women, keeping their voices low as they worked
K26 0400  5    around the house or sat in the living room, sounded
K26 0410  1    like chickens shut up in a coop for the night. The
K26 0410 12    children had to play away from the house (in the barn
K26 0420  9    loft or the pasture behind the barn), to maintain a
K26 0430  5    proper quietness.
K26 0430  7       Off and on, all day, someone would be wiping at
K26 0440  5    the powdery gray dust that settled over everything.
K26 0450  1    The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny's room,
K26 0450 10    and her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the
K26 0460 12    house stayed open, though there was a question as to
K26 0470  8    whether it was hotter or cooler that way.
K26 0480  2       The dust clogged their throats, and the heat parched
K26 0480 11    them, so that the women were always making ice water.
K26 0490 10    They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy
K26 0500 10    fifty-pound blocks of ice in town, as the electric
K26 0510  4    refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice
K26 0510 11    for the crowds who ate and drank there.
K26 0520  8       One afternoon, as the women sat clucking softly,
K26 0530  4    a new carload of people pulled up at the gate. It was
K26 0540  3    a Cadillac, black grayed with the dust of the road,
K26 0540 13    its windows closed tight so you knew that the people
K26 0550  9    who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled.
K26 0560  5    They were an old fat couple (as Linda Kay described
K26 0570  2    them to herself), a thick middle-aged man, and a girl
K26 0570 13    about ten or twelve.
K26 0580  4       There was much embracing, much exclaiming. "Cousin
K26 0590  1    Ada! Cousin John"! "Cousin Lura"! "Cousin Howard"!
K26 0600  2    "And how is she"? "About the same, John, about the
K26 0610  2    same".
K26 0610  3       All the women got up and offered their chairs, and
K26 0620  1    when they were all seated again, the guests made their
K26 0620 11    inquiries and their explanations.
K26 0630  3       "We were on our vacation in Canada", Howard explained,
K26 0640  3    in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming,
K26 0650  1    "and the news didn't catch up with us till we were
K26 0650 12    nearly home. We came on as soon as we could".
K26 0660  9       There was the suggestion of ice water, and- in spite
K26 0670  7    of the protest "We're not really thirsty"- Linda Kay,
K26 0680  3    to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices,
K26 0690  3    hurried to the kitchen.
K26 0690  7       She filled a big pitcher and set it, with glasses,
K26 0700  6    on a tray. Carrying it to the living room, she imagined
K26 0710  3    the picture she made: tall and roundly slim, a bit
K26 0710 13    sophisticated in her yellow sheath, with a graceful
K26 0720  8    swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with
K26 0730  7    the school band. Almost immediately she was ashamed
K26 0740  3    of herself for feeling vain, at such a time, in such
K26 0740 14    a place, and she tossed back her long yellow hair,
K26 0750 10    smiling shyly as she entered the room.
K26 0760  4       Howard (the thick middle-aged man) was looking at
K26 0770  2    her. She felt the look and looked back because she
K26 0770 12    could not help it, seeing that he was neither as old
K26 0780  9    nor as thick as she had at first believed.
K26 0790  2       "And who is this"? he asked, when she passed him
K26 0800  2    a glass.
K26 0800  4       "Oh that's Linda Kay", Mama Albright said fondly.
K26 0810  3    "She married our baby boy, Bobby Joe, this summer".
K26 0820  1       "Let's see", Cousin Ada said. "He's a right smart
K26 0830  1    younger than the rest"?
K26 0830  5       "Oh yes", Mama laughed. "He's ten years younger
K26 0840  4    than Ernest. We didn't expect him to come along; thought
K26 0850  3    for the longest he was a tumor".
K26 0850 10       This joke was not funny to Linda Kay, and she blushed,
K26 0860 10    as she always did; then, hearing the muffled boom of
K26 0870  7    Howard's laughter, blushed redder.
K26 0880  1       "Who is Howard, anyway"? she asked Bobby Joe that
K26 0890  1    night. "He makes me uncomfortable".
K26 0890  6       "Oh he's a second cousin or something. He got in
K26 0900  7    the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some
K26 0910  4    money".
K26 0910  5       "How old is he"?
K26 0910  9       "Gosh, I don't know. Thirty-five, I guess. He's
K26 0920  9    been married and got this half-grown kid. If he bothers
K26 0930  9    you, don't pay him any mind. He's just a big windbag".
K26 0940  6    Bobby Joe was thinking about something else. "Say,
K26 0950  3    did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope
K26 0960  1    season on the Double X"?
K26 0960  6       He was talking about antelope again when they woke
K26 0970  5    up. "Listen, I never had a chance to kill an antelope.
K26 0980  4    There never was a season before, but now they want
K26 0990  1    to thin 'em out on account of the drouth".
K26 0990 10       "Did he ever visit here when he was a kid"? Linda
K26 1000  9    Kay asked.
K26 1000 11       "Who"?
K26 1010  1       "Howard".
K26 1010  2       "Hell, I don't know. When he was a kid I wasn't
K26 1020  6    around".
K26 1020  7       Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door, and with
K26 1030  5    a quick "Bye now" was gone for the day.
K26 1040  1       Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora
K26 1040  8    drove up in the Cadillac.
K26 1050  3       "We're going after ice", Howard said, "and thought
K26 1060  2    maybe you'd go along and keep us company".
K26 1060 10       There was really no reason to refuse, and Linda
K26 1070  9    Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac.
K26 1080  3       Driving along the caliche-topped road to town, Howard
K26 1090  1    talked. Finally he said, "Tell me about yourself",
K26 1090  9    and Linda Kay told him, because she thought herself
K26 1100  8    that she had had an interesting life. She was such
K26 1110  5    a well-rounded teenager, having been a twirler, Future
K26 1120  2    Farmers sweetheart, and secretary of Future Homemakers.
K26 1130  1    In her sophomore year she had started going steady
K26 1130 10    with Bobby Joe, who was a football player, Future Homemakers
K26 1140  8    sweetheart, and president of Future Farmers. It was
K26 1150  6    easy to see that they were made for each other, and
K26 1160  4    they knew what they wanted. Bobby Joe would be a senior
K26 1170  1    this year, and he planned to graduate. But there was
K26 1170 11    no need for Linda Kay to go on, since all she wanted
K26 1180 10    in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and (blushing)
K26 1190  6    raise his children.
K26 1190  9       Howard sighed. "You lucky kids", he said. "I'd give
K26 1200  8    anything if I could have found a girl like you". Then
K26 1210  8    he told Linda Kay about himself. Of course he couldn't
K26 1220  5    say much, really, because of Debora, but Linda Kay
K26 1230  3    could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been
K26 1230 13    and what a raw deal he had got. It made her feel different
K26 1240 13    about Howard.
K26 1250  1       She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken
K26 1250 11    she had been, but he brought one of the cousins home
K26 1260 10    for supper, and all they did was talk about antelope.
K26 1270  6       Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she
K26 1280  5    would cook one if he brought it home.
K26 1280 13       "Cook a whole antelope"? she exclaimed. "Why, I
K26 1290  8    couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak; I never
K26 1300  8    even saw any".
K26 1300 11       "Oh, you could. I want to roast the whole thing,
K26 1310 10    and have it for the boys".
K26 1320  1       Linda Kay told him he couldn't do anything like
K26 1320 10    that with his Grandma dying, and he said well they
K26 1330 10    had to eat, didn't they, they weren't all dying. Linda
K26 1340  7    Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry; but
K26 1350  5    they were going up to the Big House after supper, and
K26 1360  2    she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a
K26 1360 15    little.
K26 1370  1       Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's,
K26 1370 11    and sat on the open front porch, where they could get
K26 1380 11    the breeze. It was full-of-the-moon (or a little past),
K26 1390  9    and nearly light as day. They all sat around and drank
K26 1400  5    ice water, and the men smoked, and everybody had a
K26 1410  2    good time. Once in a while they said what a shame it
K26 1410 14    was, with Granny dying, but they all agreed she wouldn't
K26 1420  8    have wanted it any other way.
K26 1430  2       That night the older men got to talking about going
K26 1430 12    possum-hunting on a moonlight night. Bobby Joe and
K26 1440  8    two or three of the other boys declared they had never
K26 1450  7    been possum-hunting, and Uncle Bill Farnworth (from
K26 1460  3    Mama Albright's side of the family) said he would just
K26 1461  2    get up from there and take them, right then.
K26 1470  9       After they had left, some of the people moved around,
K26 1480  9    to find more comfortable places to sit. There were
K26 1490  5    not many chairs, so that some preferred to sit on the
K26 1500  3    edge of the porch, resting their feet on the ground,
K26 1500 13    and others liked to sit where they could lean back
K26 1510  9    against the wall. Howard, who had been sitting against
K26 1520  6    the wall, said he needed more fresh air, and took the
K26 1530  4    spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been
K26 1540  1    sitting.
K26 1540  2       "You'll be a darn sight more comfortable there,
K26 1540 10    Howard", Ernest said, laughing, and they all laughed.
K26 1550  8       Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable.
K26 1560 10    Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her, touching her
K26 1570  8    actually, and holding her hand from time to time, but
K26 1580  6    it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer. Perhaps
K26 1590  2    it was just that he had so much more flesh, so that
K26 1590 14    more of it seemed to come in contact with hers; but
K26 1600 10    she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before.
K26 1610  5       Still she was not sorry he sat by her, but in fact
K26 1620  6    was flattered. He had become the center of the company,
K26 1630  2    such stories he had to tell. He had sold oil stock
K26 1630 13    to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person; he had helped
K26 1640  9    fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights.
