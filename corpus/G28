G28 0010  1       Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay, his thesis
G28 0010  9    is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which
G28 0020 10    he obviously has. He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren
G28 0030  9    have fallen to the temptation which besets many of
G28 0040  5    us to read into our authors- Nathaniel Hawthorne, for
G28 0050  3    example, and Herman Melville- protests against modernism,
G28 0060  2    material progress, and science which are genuine protests
G28 0060 10    of our own but may not have been theirs. Faulkner's
G28 0070 10    total works today, and in fact those of his works which
G28 0080  9    existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment, or
G28 0090  5    in 1939, when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay, reveal
G28 0100  3    no such simple attitude toward the South. If he is
G28 0100 13    a traditionalist, he is an eclectic traditionalist.
G28 0110  7    If he condemns the recent or the present, he condemns
G28 0120  7    the past with no less force. If he sees the heroic
G28 0130  4    in a Sartoris or a Sutpen, he sees also- and he shows-
G28 0140  1    the blind and the mean, and he sees the Compson family
G28 0140 12    disintegrating from within. If the barn-burner's family
G28 0150  8    produces a Flem Snopes, who personifies commercialism
G28 0160  5    and materialism in hyperbolic crassness, the Compson
G28 0170  4    family produces a Jason Compson IV. Faulkner is a
G28 0180  3    most untraditional traditionalist.
G28 0180  6       Others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase
G28 0190  6    "traditional moralist" either inadequate or misleading.
G28 0200  3    Among them are Frederick J. Hoffman, William Van O'Connor,
G28 0210  3    and Mrs. Olga Vickery. They have indicated the direction
G28 0220  3    but they have not been explicit enough, I believe,
G28 0220 12    in pointing out Faulkner's independence, his questioning
G28 0230  7    if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition. Faulkner's
G28 0240  6    is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O'Donnell
G28 0250  7    implies that it is. He is not one to remain more comfortably
G28 0260  7    and unquestioningly within a body of social, cultural,
G28 0270  4    or literary traditions than he was within the traditions-
G28 0280  3    or possibly the regulations- governing his tenure in
G28 0280 11    the post office at Oxford, Mississippi, thirty-five
G28 0290  8    years ago.
G28 0300  1       That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions,
G28 0300 12    of course, that he is steeped in them, in fact, or
G28 0310  9    that he has dealt with them, in his books. It is to
G28 0320  6    say rather, I believe, that he has brought to bear
G28 0330  1    on the history, the traditions, and the lore of his
G28 0330 11    region a critical, skeptical mind- the same mind which
G28 0340  7    has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary
G28 0350  4    form and technique. He has employed from his section
G28 0360  3    rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can
G28 0360 12    be termed Southern. The fact that he has cast over
G28 0370  9    those materials the light of a skeptical mind does
G28 0380  6    not make him any the less Southern, I rather think,
G28 0390  2    for the South has been no more solid than other regions
G28 0390 13    except in the political and related areas where patronage
G28 0400  9    and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface
G28 0410  8    uniformity. Some of us might be inclined to argue,
G28 0420  5    in fact, that an independence of mind and action and
G28 0430  2    an intolerance of regimentation, either mental or physical,
G28 0440  1    are particularly Southern traits.
G28 0440  5       There is no necessity, I suppose, to assert that
G28 0450  4    Mr. Faulkner is Southern. It would not be easy to discover
G28 0460  4    a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his
G28 0470  1    family. And, after all, he has lived comfortably at
G28 0470 10    both Oxford, Mississippi, and Charlottesville, Virginia.
G28 0480  4    The young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920's
G28 0490  7    impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously
G28 0500  4    conscious of being a Southerner, and there is no evidence
G28 0510  2    that since then he has ever considered himself any
G28 0510 11    less so. Besides showing no inclination, apparently,
G28 0520  6    to absent himself from his native region even for short
G28 0530  6    periods, and in addition writing a shelf of books set
G28 0540  4    in the region, he has handled in those books an astonishingly
G28 0550  1    complete list of matters which have been important
G28 0550  9    in the South during the past hundred years.
G28 0560  6       It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most
G28 0570  4    authors to say what is the extent and what is the source
G28 0580  3    of his knowledge. His own testimony is that he has
G28 0580 13    read very little in the history of the South, implying
G28 0590  9    that what he knows of that history has come to him
G28 0600  7    orally and that he knows the world around him primarily
G28 0610  3    from his own unassisted observation. His denials of
G28 0610 11    extensive reading notwithstanding, it is no doubt safe
G28 0620  8    to assume that he has spent time schooling himself
G28 0630  6    in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance
G28 0640  4    with the chief literary authors who have lived in the
G28 0650  3    South or have written about the South. To believe otherwise
G28 0660  1    would be unrealistic.
G28 0660  4       But in looking at Faulkner against his background
G28 0670  3    in Mississippi and the South, it is important not to
G28 0680  1    lose the broader perspective. His earliest work reflected
G28 0680  9    heavy influences from English and continental writers.
G28 0690  6    Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he
G28 0710  5    has been indebted to the Gothic romancers, who deal
G28 0720  3    in extravagant horror, to the symbolists writing at
G28 0720 11    the end of the preceding century, and in particular
G28 0730  8    to the stream-of-consciousness novelists, Henry James
G28 0740  4    and James Joyce among them. His repeated experimentation
G28 0750  2    with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence
G28 0760  1    of mind and an originality of approach, but it also
G28 0760 11    shows him touching at many points the stream of literary
G28 0770  9    development back of him. My intention, therefore, is
G28 0780  5    not to say that Faulkner's awareness has been confined
G28 0790  4    within the borders of the South, but rather that he
G28 0800  2    has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably
G28 0800 13    his outlook is Southern.
G28 0810  3       The ingredients of Faulkner's novels and stories
G28 0820  2    are by no means new with him, and most of the problems
G28 0820 14    he takes up have had the attention of authors before
G28 0830  9    him. A useful comment on his relation to his region
G28 0840  7    may be made, I think, by noting briefly how in handling
G28 0850  4    Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated
G28 0860  1    from the pattern set by other Southern authors while
G28 0860 10    remaining faithful to the essential character of the
G28 0870  8    region.
G28 0870  9       The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature
G28 0880  6    at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn
G28 0890  5    in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether
G28 0900  4    presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the
G28 0910  2    most persistent tradition of Southern literature. The
G28 0910  9    thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did
G28 0920  7    not come, however, until after the Civil War when Southern
G28 0930  8    writers were eager to defend a way of life which had
G28 0940  7    been destroyed. As they looked with nostalgia to a
G28 0950  3    society which had been swept away, they were probably
G28 0950 12    no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors
G28 0960  9    which had never existed. Their books found no less
G28 0970  6    willing readers outside than inside the South, even
G28 0980  3    while memories of the war were still sharp. The tradition
G28 0990  1    reached its apex, perhaps, in the works of Thomas Nelson
G28 0990 11    Page toward the end of the century, and reappeared
G28 1000  8    undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel
G28 1010  6    So Red the Rose, by Stark Young. Although Faulkner
G28 1020  3    was the heir in his own family to this tradition, he
G28 1030  2    did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize
G28 1030 10    and sentimentalize the planter society.
G28 1040  4       The myth of the Southern plantation has had only
G28 1050  4    a tangential relation with actuality, as Francis Pendleton
G28 1060  2    Gaines showed forty years ago, and I suspect it has
G28 1060 12    had a far narrower acceptance as something real than
G28 1070  8    has generally been supposed. Faulkner has found it
G28 1080  5    useful, but he has employed it with his habitual independence
G28 1090  3    of mind and skeptical outlook. Without saying or seeming
G28 1100  2    to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson
G28 1100 12    families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism,
G28 1110  7    we can say nevertheless that through those families
G28 1120  5    he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties
G28 1130  3    as they have existed since the decades before the Civil
G28 1140  1    War. It may be that in this comment he has broken from
G28 1140 13    the conventional pattern more violently than in any
G28 1150  7    other regard, for the treatment in his books is far
G28 1160  6    removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow,
G28 1170  2    who was the only important novelist before him to challenge
G28 1180  1    the conventional picture of planter society.
G28 1180  7       Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts
G28 1190  6    in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation
G28 1200  4    life. They have an ancestry extending back, however,
G28 1210  2    at least to 1728, when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders
G28 1220  1    he encountered in the back country of Virginia and
G28 1220 10    North Carolina. The chief literary antecedents of the
G28 1240  7    Snopes clan appeared in the realistic, humorous writing
G28 1250  4    which originated in the South and the Southwest in
G28 1260  3    the three decades before the Civil War. These narratives
G28 1270  1    of coarse action and crude language appeared first
G28 1270  9    in local newspapers, as a rule, and later found their
G28 1280  8    way between book covers, though rarely into the planters'
G28 1290  5    libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace,
G28 1300  3    Mr. Addison, Mr. Pope, and Sir Walter Scott. There
G28 1310  2    is evidence to suggest, in fact, that many authors
G28 1310 11    of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them-
G28 1320  7    or to make them as indelicate as they are- by way of
G28 1330  7    protesting against the artificial refinements which
G28 1340  2    had come to dominate the polite letters of the South.
G28 1340 12    William Gilmore Simms, sturdy realist that he was,
G28 1350  8    pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in
G28 1360  3    his favorites the great Elizabethans, to vivify the
G28 1370  4    pale writings being produced around him. Simms admired
G28 1380  1    the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods, but
G28 1380  9    he had himself social affiliations which would not
G28 1390  5    allow him to approve them fully. Augustus Baldwin Longstreet,
G28 1400  3    a preacher and a college and university president in
G28 1410  2    four Southern states, published the earliest of these
G28 1410 10    backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle,
G28 1420  8    in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging
G28 1430  7    physical combat, and in the shockingly unliterary speech
G28 1440  3    of his characters, he set an example followed by many
G28 1450  3    after him.
G28 1450  5       Others who wrote of low characters and low life
G28 1460  2    included Thomas Bangs Thorpe, creator of the Big Bear
G28 1460 11    of Arkansas and Tom Owen, the Bee-Hunter; Johnson Jones
G28 1470  9    Hooper, whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship
G28 1480  8    to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel
G28 1490  7    advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with
G28 1500  3    which he habitually carried out his will; and George
G28 1510  1    Washington Harris, whose Tennessee hillbilly character
G28 1510  7    Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief
G28 1520  5    and more unintended pain than any other character in
G28 1530  6    literature. It would be profitable, I believe, to read
G28 1540  3    these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works,
G28 1550  1    the thought being not that he necessarily read them
G28 1550 10    and owed anything to them directly, but rather that
G28 1560  7    they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people
G28 1570  5    and a type of life which have continued down to our
G28 1580  1    time, to Faulkner's time. Such a comparison reminds
G28 1580  9    us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner
G28 1590  7    is recording actuality in the South and moreover is
G28 1600  7    following a long-established literary precedent. Such
G28 1610  2    characters, with their low existence and often low
G28 1610 10    morality, produce humorous effects in his novels and
G28 1620  8    tales, as they did in the writing of Longstreet and
G28 1630  6    Hooper and Harris, but it need not be added that he
G28 1640  4    gives them far subtler and more intricate functions
G28 1640 12    than they had in the earlier writers; nor is there
G28 1650 10    need to add that among them are some of the most highly
G28 1660  8    individualized and most successful of his characters.
G28 1670  4       One of the early humorists already mentioned, Thomas
G28 1680  2    Bangs Thorpe, can be used to illustrate another point
G28 1690  1    where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials
G28 1690  7    and also earlier literary treatment of those materials.
G28 1700  6    Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man
G28 1710  7    prepared to find in the new country the setting of
G28 1720  2    romantic adventure and idealized beauty. But Thorpe
G28 1720  9    saw also the hardships of pioneer existence, the cultural
G28 1730  8    poverty of the frontier settlements, and the slack
G28 1740  5    morality which abounded in the new regions. As a consequence
G28 1750  4    of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings,
G28 1760  2    he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting
G28 1760 12    trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of
G28 1770 11    Hardscrabble, Arkansas, where no one had ever seen
G28 1780  7    a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier
G28 1790  3    humor, "The Big Bear of Arkansas", in which earthy
G28 1800  2    realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the
G28 1800 10    backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates
G28 1810 10    the grandeur and the mysteries of nature.
