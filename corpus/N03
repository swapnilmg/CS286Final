N03 0010  1       The sentry was not dead. He was, in fact, showing
N03 0010 11    signs of reviving. He had been carrying an Enfield
N03 0020  7    rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol. A bayonet
N03 0030  4    hung in a belt scabbard. He was partially uniformed
N03 0040  2    in a cavalry tunic and hat. Mike stripped these from
N03 0040 12    him and donned them. He and Dean tied and gagged the
N03 0050 11    man, using his belt and shirt for the purpose. They
N03 0060  7    dragged him inside the building.
N03 0070  1       Fiske joined them, unsteady on his feet. Julia,
N03 0070  9    seeing the bandage, rushed to him. "You are hurt"!
N03 0080  7    she breathed.
N03 0090  1       "I never felt better in my life", Fiske blustered.
N03 0090  9       He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek.
N03 0100  9    "Thank you, My dear", he said. "You are very brave".
N03 0120  6       Mike silenced them. "We'll talk later. First, we've
N03 0130  5    got to get out of here".
N03 0130 11       "We'll grab horses", Dean said. "The main bunch
N03 0140  8    is outside, but there are some over there inside the
N03 0150  8    wall".
N03 0150  9       Mike debated it, trying to decide whether Fiske
N03 0160  6    was strong enough to ride. But it at least offered
N03 0170  3    him a chance for living. He had none here. And, for
N03 0180  1    the sake of Julia and Susan, it had to be tried.
N03 0180 12       The guerrilla bivouac remained silent. Light showed
N03 0190  5    in the orderly room across the parade ground. Someone
N03 0200  4    evidently was on duty there. No doubt there would be
N03 0210  3    men guarding the horses.
N03 0210  7       About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade,
N03 0220  5    as best Mike could make out in the moonlight. Evidently
N03 0230  2    this was a precaution so that mounts would be available
N03 0240  1    in an emergency.
N03 0240  4       He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske. "Dean and
N03 0250  2    myself will try to cut out horses to ride", he said.
N03 0250 13    "We'll stampede the rest. You stay with the ladies.
N03 0260  9    All of you be ready to ride hell for leather".
N03 0270  6       He added, "If this doesn't work out, the three of
N03 0280  6    you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms
N03 0290  2    with them".
N03 0290  4       He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.
N03 0300  2    Susan halted Dean and kissed him. She clung to him,
N03 0300 12    talking to him, and dabbing at her eyes.
N03 0310  8       Mike turned away. He was thinking that the way she
N03 0320  6    had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he
N03 0330  3    had believed it had. He felt unutterably weary.
N03 0330 11       Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in
N03 0340  9    his arms. He kissed her also, and with deep tenderness.
N03 0350  6    She too began to weep. He released her and joined Mike.
N03 0360  5    "All right", he said.
N03 0360  9       Mike only said, "Later".
N03 0370  2       "Be careful, McLish"! Susan said fiercely.
N03 0390  1       "The way you were careful"? he snorted. "Running
N03 0400  1    around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a
N03 0400 10    man with a rock"?
N03 0410  1       He kept going. He wanted no more sentimental scenes
N03 0410 10    with her. He might say or do something foolish. Something
N03 0420 10    all of them would regret. He might tell her how sorry
N03 0430  9    a spectacle she was making of herself, pretending to
N03 0440  5    be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's
N03 0450  2    affections from her. And using him, Mike McLish, as
N03 0450 11    a sop to her pride.
N03 0460  5       He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.
N03 0470  2    "Stay well back of me", he said. "I'm going to walk
N03 0480  1    up to the horses, bold as brass, pretending I'm one
N03 0480 11    of the guerrillas. There's bound to be someone on guard,
N03 0490  8    but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get
N03 0500  7    close".
N03 0500  8       Holding the pistol concealed, he walked to the rear
N03 0510  6    wall of the stockade. It was pierced by a wagon gate
N03 0520  4    built of two wings. One wing stood open. Mike passed
N03 0520 14    through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses.
N03 0530 10    They were tethered, army style, on stable lines.
N03 0540  6       A voice spoke near-at-hand. "Who's thet"?
N03 0550  2       Just me", Mike said. "Is that you, Bill"?
N03 0560  2       He located his man. The guard stood in the shadow
N03 0570  1    of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight.
N03 0570 12    Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before
N03 0580  8    the man became suspicious and straightened from his
N03 0590  5    lax slouch.
N03 0590  7       Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol. But the
N03 0600  6    luck that had been running their way left him. The
N03 0610  3    guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle.
N03 0610 11    He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's
N03 0620 10    body.
N03 0630  1       Mike, off balance, managed to bat the muzzle away
N03 0630  9    a moment before it exploded. The bullet went wide.
N03 0640  5    Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash. This time
N03 0650  3    it connected solidly on the man's temple, felling him.
N03 0660  2       The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the
N03 0660 11    walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still
N03 0670 10    rolling in the hills. The startled horses began rearing
N03 0680  5    on their tethers.
N03 0680  8       Dean came rushing up. "Are you hit"? he demanded.
N03 0690  8       "No, but the fat's in the fire"! Mike said. "There's
N03 0700  8    no chance now of all of us getting away. You'll have
N03 0710  7    to try it alone".
N03 0710 11       The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby,
N03 0720  7    having been kept handy in case of need.
N03 0730  5       Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed
N03 0740  2    the picket line. "Up you go"! he said. "Ride"!
N03 0750  1       Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward
N03 0750  9    the horse. "Why not you"? he protested.
N03 0760  6       "Dammit"! Mike said frantically. "You're lighter
N03 0770  4    than me. It's our only chance now. Try to find these
N03 0780  5    Feds. The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang
N03 0790  3    on until you get back. You're the one that's taking
N03 0790 13    the big chance".
N03 0800  3       Dean still hesitated, but Mike lifted him almost
N03 0810  1    bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his
N03 0810 11    hand.
N03 0820  1       "No telling how good this horse is", Mike panted.
N03 0820  9    "Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble.
N03 0830  8    Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight. Take
N03 0840  5    the pistol. You might need it. We'll still have the
N03 0850  3    rifle, and I might be able to round up some more. I'll
N03 0860  1    stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase
N03 0860 11    you".
N03 0870  1       Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty
N03 0870 11    whack on the back. "McLish", he said as he kicked the
N03 0880  8    horse into motion, "I'd be a mighty sad man if we never
N03 0890  9    met again".
N03 0890 11       Then he was on his way at a gallop. Mike ran down
N03 0900  9    the line, slashing picket ropes with the bayonet. He
N03 0910  5    lifted a screeching war whoop. That touched off a total
N03 0920  3    stampede. He darted inside the stockade and freed the
N03 0920 12    horses there. These poured through the gate and joined
N03 0930  9    the flight. The animals thundered away into the moonlight,
N03 0940  6    heading for the ridges.
N03 0950  1       The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac
N03 0950  7    at the west end of the enclosure.
N03 0960  2       "'Paches"! Mike yelled. "They're stealin' the stock"!
N03 0970  3       He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the
N03 0980  3    stockade and then followed the south wall until he
N03 0980 12    was at the rear of the two frame buildings. He crouched
N03 0990  9    there.
N03 0990 10       His shout had been taken up and repeated. The guerrillas
N03 1000  9    were running across the parade ground and through the
N03 1010  7    rear gate in the wake of the departing horses. All
N03 1020  3    were carrying guns they had seized up, but they were
N03 1030  1    half-clad or hardly clad at all.
N03 1030  8       Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post. They
N03 1040  5    had pistols in their hands. They bawled questions that
N03 1050  2    were not answered in the uproar. They followed the
N03 1050 11    others toward the east gate. Beyond the stockade rifles
N03 1060  9    began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at
N03 1070  3    shadows that they imagined were Apaches.
N03 1080  1       Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings.
N03 1080 12    He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood
N03 1090  7    between the buildings and peered around a corner. The
N03 1100  5    area was deserted. A man was standing in the open door
N03 1110  3    of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left,
N03 1120  1    but he, too, suddenly made up his mind and went racing
N03 1120 12    to join the confused activity at the east end of the
N03 1130  9    stockade.
N03 1130 10       Mike crawled to the door and peered in. The orderly
N03 1140  9    room seemed to be deserted. A lantern hung from a peg,
N03 1150  7    giving light. Ducking inside, he found that three rifles
N03 1160  3    were stacked in a corner. A brace of pistols, holstered
N03 1170  1    on belts, hung from a peg, along with ammunition pouches.
N03 1170 11    An ammunition case stood open, containing canisters
N03 1180  6    which contained powder cartridges.
N03 1190  1       Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner,
N03 1190 11    spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in
N03 1200 13    which he placed his booty.
N03 1210  1       Shouldering the load he peered from the door. His
N03 1210 10    looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute
N03 1220 10    or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas.
N03 1230  6       He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons,
N03 1240  5    struck by a new inspiration. He set his bundle down.
N03 1250  2    Snatching the lantern from its peg, he shattered its
N03 1250 11    globe with a blow against a post. He picked up the
N03 1260 10    powder canister and ran out. Bursting paper cartridges,
N03 1270  4    he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped
N03 1280  3    the contents of the canister upon it.
N03 1280 10       He shouldered the blanket again, backed off, and
N03 1290  7    tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon.
N03 1300  5    He turned and raced across the parade ground toward
N03 1310  2    the rock house.
N03 1310  5       Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon. The stockade
N03 1320  3    was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted
N03 1320 10    him. They realized the truth. Bullets began to snap
N03 1330  9    past him. One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles
N03 1340  8    that projected from the shoulder pack. Its force spun
N03 1350  5    him around, but he recovered and got into stride again.
N03 1360  2       A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when
N03 1360 12    he was a stride or two from safety. Another struck
N03 1370 10    him heavily in the thigh and he went down.
N03 1380  5       Guerrillas were racing toward him. Susan and Julia
N03 1390  3    came from the door and dragged him with them. The three
N03 1400  1    of them floundered through the door into the interior
N03 1400 10    and fell in a heap.
N03 1410  1       Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door.
N03 1410 10    She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal, chewing
N03 1420  9    into the planks. Some tore entirely through the whipsawed
N03 1430  6    post oak. The iron hinges held, but the planks were
N03 1440  5    in danger of being torn from the crossbars.
N03 1450  1       mike rolled to Susan, grasped her around the knees,
N03 1450 10    dragging her off her feet. He hovered over her to shield
N03 1460  9    her, for spent bullets were thudding against the rear
N03 1470  5    walls.
N03 1470  6       He peered from a loophole. Guerrillas were only
N03 1480  3    a dozen yards away, charging the house. Mike snatched
N03 1490  1    a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired.
N03 1490 11    He dropped a man with the first bullet. At the same
N03 1500 10    moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given
N03 1510  6    him and another guerrilla was hit. That halted the
N03 1520  2    rush. The guerrillas scattered for cover.
N03 1520  8       The wagons were burning fiercely. The mudwagon had
N03 1530  7    caught fire also. The blaze was spreading to the frame
N03 1540  6    buildings.
N03 1540  7       The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem.
N03 1550  6    "Gawdamighty"! one screeched. "There goes our grub
N03 1560  4    an' ammunition"!
N03 1560  6       "Get a bucket line going"! Calhoun shouted. "Hurry!
N03 1570  5    Hurry"!
N03 1570  6       The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails
N03 1580  7    in which to bring water from the spring. But what few
N03 1590  6    containers they found were inadequate. Many of them,
N03 1600  3    in increasing panic, came running with water in their
N03 1600 12    hats in a ludicrous effort. Both buildings were in
N03 1610  9    flames. The heat drove the guerrillas back. The roof
N03 1620  6    of the command post began to buckle.
N03 1630  1       "Drag the wagons to the spring"! Lew Durkin yelled.
N03 1630 10    "Run 'em right into the spring! Hustle"!
N03 1640  7       One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame.
N03 1650  8    A sizable supply of powder had been touched off. The
N03 1660  6    wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were
N03 1670  3    the buildings.
N03 1670  5       The glow of the fire reached through the openings
N03 1680  2    in the windows, giving light enough to examine Mike's
N03 1680 11    wound. The bullet had torn through the flesh just above
N03 1690 10    the knee, inflicting an ugly gash that was forming
N03 1700  7    a pool of blood on the floor. But it had missed the
N03 1710  5    bone and had passed on through. Susan and Julia ripped
N03 1720  2    strips from their clothing and bound the injury.
N03 1720 10       Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to
N03 1730 10    hobble around on it.
