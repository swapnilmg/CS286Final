D01 0010  1    As a result, although we still make use of this distinction,
D01 0010 12    there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic
D01 0020 10    terms employed. Just what is meant by "spirit" and
D01 0030  6    by "matter"? The terms are generally taken for granted
D01 0040  4    as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements
D01 0050  2    in the common experience of all. Yet in the contemporary
D01 0060  1    context this is precisely what one must not do. For
D01 0060 11    in the modern world neither "spirit" nor "matter" refer
D01 0070  6    to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience.
D01 0080  4    We are in a transitional stage in which many of the
D01 0090  4    connotations of former usage have had to be revised
D01 0090 13    or rejected. When the words are used, we are never
D01 0100  9    sure which of the traditional meanings the user may
D01 0110  5    have in mind, or to what extent his revisions and rejections
D01 0120  3    of former understandings correspond to ours.
D01 0130  1       One of the most widespread features of contemporary
D01 0130  9    thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality
D01 0140  7    of spirit. Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits
D01 0150  6    was as populous and real as the world of material entities.
D01 0160  3    Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly
D01 0170  1    educated as well was this true. Demons, fairies, angels,
D01 0170 10    and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a
D01 0180  9    part of the experiential world of western man as were
D01 0190  7    rocks and trees and stars. In such a world the words
D01 0200  3    "matter" and "spirit" both referred to directly known
D01 0210  2    realities in the common experience of all. In it important
D01 0210 12    elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of
D01 0220  9    reality in general, which now cause us much difficulty,
D01 0230  7    could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously.
D01 0240  3       The progress of science over these last few centuries
D01 0250  3    and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific
D01 0260  1    categories of reality have to a large extent emptied
D01 0260 10    the spirit world of the entities which previously populated
D01 0270  7    it. In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly
D01 0280  5    performed a very considerable service for which it
D01 0290  4    can claim due credit. The objectification of the world
D01 0300  1    of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone
D01 0300  9    far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify
D01 0310  6    or support. Science is fully competent to deal with
D01 0320  4    any element of experience which arises from an object
D01 0330  1    in space and time. When, therefore, it turned its attention
D01 0330 11    to the concrete entities with which popular imagination
D01 0340  7    had peopled the world of spirit, these entities soon
D01 0350  6    lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements
D01 0360  4    of external reality. In doing so science has unquestionably
D01 0370  1    cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous
D01 0380  1    and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable
D01 0380 10    popular superstitions. There have been, indeed, many
D01 0390  7    important and valuable gains from the development of
D01 0400  5    our present scientific view of the world for which
D01 0410  3    we may be rightly grateful.
D01 0410  8       All this has not, however, been an unmixed blessing.
D01 0420  5    The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been
D01 0430  3    in a way too successful and too thorough. The house
D01 0430 13    has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been
D01 0440 10    left with no means, or at best with wholly inadequate
D01 0450  7    means, for dealing with his experience of spirit. Although
D01 0460  4    the particular form of conceptualization which popular
D01 0470  2    imagination had made in response to the experience
D01 0470 10    of spirit was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience
D01 0480  7    itself which led to such excesses remains with us as
D01 0490  6    vividly as ever. We simply find ourselves in the position
D01 0500  4    of having no means for inquiring into the structure
D01 0510  1    and meaning of this range of our experience. There
D01 0510 10    is no framework or structure of thought with respect
D01 0520  7    to which we can organize it and no part of reality,
D01 0530  3    as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which
D01 0530 13    we can refer this experience. Science has simply left
D01 0540  9    us helpless and powerless in this important sector
D01 0550  5    of our lives.
D01 0550  8       The situation in which we find ourselves is brought
D01 0560  7    out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The
D01 0570  4    Crucible, which deals with the Salem witch trials.
D01 0580  2    As the play opens the audience is introduced to the
D01 0580 12    community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of
D01 0590 10    the eighteenth century. Aside from a quaint concern
D01 0600  6    with witches and devils which provides the immediate
D01 0610  3    problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal
D01 0610 13    community. The conversation of the characters creates
D01 0620  7    an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures,
D01 0630  6    foibles, irritations, and concerns which would characterize
D01 0640  4    the common life of a normal village in any age. There
D01 0650  3    is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these
D01 0650 13    people. Instead, the audience can sit back at ease
D01 0660  9    and, from the perspective of an enlightened time which
D01 0670  6    no longer believes in such things, enjoy the dead seriousness
D01 0680  5    with which the characters in the play take the witches
D01 0690  3    and devils which are under discussion. A teenage girl,
D01 0690 12    Abigail Williams, is being sharply questioned by her
D01 0700  8    minister uncle, the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a
D01 0710  7    wild night affair in the woods in which she and some
D01 0720  6    other girls had seemed to have had contact with these
D01 0730  2    evil beings. For all involved in this discussion the
D01 0730 11    devil is a real entity who can really be confronted
D01 0740  9    in the woods on a dark night, the demon world is populated
D01 0750  6    with real creatures, and witches actually can be seen
D01 0760  4    flying through the air.
D01 0760  8       As the play unfolds, however, the audience is subtly
D01 0770  5    brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows
D01 0780  3    with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the
D01 0780 11    community. Everyone in Salem, saint and sinner alike,
D01 0790  8    is swept up by it. It is like a mysterious epidemic
D01 0800  7    which, starting first with Abigail and Parris, spreads
D01 0810  4    inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through
D01 0820  1    the whole town until all have been infected by it.
D01 0820 11    It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves
D01 0830  7    in its wake a trail of misery, moral disintegration,
D01 0840  3    and destruction. The audience leaves the play under
D01 0850  2    a spell, It is the kind of spell which the exposure
D01 0850 13    to spirit in its living active manifestation always
D01 0860  7    evokes.
D01 0860  8       If one asks about this play, what it is that comes
D01 0870  9    upon this community and works within it with such terrible
D01 0880  6    power, there is no better answer to give than "spirit".
D01 0890  3    This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but only
D01 0900  2    to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply
D01 0900 12    identify a common experience. In the end the good man,
D01 0910  9    John Proctor, expresses what the audience has already
D01 0920  6    come to feel when he says, "A fire, a fire is burning!
D01 0930  5    I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face"!
D01 0940  2    The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief
D01 0940 13    in and concern with a devil who could be met in the
D01 0950 11    woods and combatted with formulae set out in books
D01 0960  6    was the very thing that prevented them from detecting
D01 0970  2    the real devil when he came among them. We marvel at
D01 0970 13    their blindness for not seeing this. Yet are not we
D01 0980 10    of the mid-twentieth century, who rightly do not believe
D01 0990  7    there is any such "thing" as the devil, just as bad
D01 1000  5    off as they- only in a different way? In our disbelief
D01 1010  2    we think that we can no longer even use the word and
D01 1010 14    so are unable to even name the elemental power which
D01 1020  9    is so vividly real in this play. We are left helpless
D01 1030  7    to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it
D01 1040  4    as anything real for fear that to do so would imply
D01 1040 15    a commitment to that which has already been discredited
D01 1050  8    and proved false.
D01 1060  1       Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this
D01 1060  9    score. In a long commentary which he has inserted in
D01 1070  9    the published text of the first act of the play, he
D01 1080  7    says at one point: "However, that experience never
D01 1090  2    raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the
D01 1090 14    underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced
D01 1100  8    lieutenants. And his belief is not to his discredit.
D01 1110  7    Better minds than Hale's were- and still are- convinced
D01 1120  5    that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken".
D01 1130  3    (page 33) On the other hand, a little later on he says:
D01 1140  1    "Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped
D01 1140 10    out God's beard and the Devil's horns, but the world
D01 1150  9    is still gripped between two diametrically opposed
D01 1160  4    absolutes. The concept of unity, in which positive
D01 1170  2    and negative are attributes of the same force, in which
D01 1170 12    good and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always
D01 1180  9    joined to the same phenomenon- such a concept is still
D01 1190  8    reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who
D01 1200  6    have grasped the history of ideas ... When we see
D01 1210  1    the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity
D01 1210  8    of the idea of man's worthlessness- until redeemed-
D01 1220  3    the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a
D01 1230  5    weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again
D01 1240  2    in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular
D01 1240 14    church or church-state". (page 34)
D01 1250  6       Apparently he does not intend that those who read
D01 1260  5    or view this play should think of the devil as being
D01 1270  1    actually real. Yet such is the dramatic power of his
D01 1270 11    writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the
D01 1280  8    grip of the terrible power and potency of that which
D01 1290  5    came over Salem. It casts a spell upon them so that
D01 1300  3    they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious
D01 1300 14    presence of an evil power. It is not enough in accounting
D01 1310 11    for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness
D01 1320  7    of individual people added together to produce a cumulative
D01 1330  5    effect. For this does not account for the integral,
D01 1340  2    elemental power of that which grows with abounding
D01 1340 10    vigor as the play unfolds, nor does it explain the
D01 1350  9    strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over
D01 1360  4    those who watch the play like a spell. The reality
D01 1370  2    of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's
D01 1370 13    convictions to the contrary.
D01 1380  4    #SPIRIT AND COMMUNITY#
D01 1380  7       There is nothing in the whole range of human experience
D01 1390  9    more widely known and universally felt than spirit.
D01 1400  5    Apart from spirit there could be no community, for
D01 1410  2    it is spirit which draws men into community and gives
D01 1410 12    to any community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence.
D01 1420  7    Think, for example, of the spirit of the Marine Corps.
D01 1430  8    Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge. We cannot,
D01 1440  5    of course, assign it any substance. It is not material
D01 1450  4    and is not a "thing" occupying space and time. Yet
D01 1460  1    it exists and has an objective reality which can be
D01 1460 11    experienced and known. So it is too with many other
D01 1470  9    spirits which we all know: the spirit of Nazism or
D01 1480  5    Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street corner
D01 1490  2    gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the
D01 1490 13    Ku Klux Klan. Every community, if it is alive has a
D01 1500 10    spirit, and that spirit is the center of its unity
D01 1510  7    and identity.
D01 1510  9       In searching for clues which might lead us to a
D01 1520  7    fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, the close
D01 1530  3    connection between spirit and community is likely to
D01 1530 11    prove the most fruitful. For it is primarily in community
D01 1540 10    that we know and experience spirit. It is spirit which
D01 1550  7    gives life to a community and causes it to cohere.
D01 1560  5    It is the spirit which is the source of a community's
D01 1570  1    drawing power by means of which others are drawn into
D01 1570 11    it from the world outside so that the community grows
D01 1580  9    and prospers. Yet the spirit which lives in community
D01 1590  6    is not identical with the community. The idea of community
D01 1600  5    and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable
D01 1610  1    ideas.
D01 1610  2       One characteristic of the spirit in community is
D01 1620  1    its givenness. The members of the community do not
D01 1620 10    create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting
D01 1630  8    for them. It is for them a given which they and they
D01 1640  5    alone possess. The spirit of the Marine Corps was present
D01 1650  3    and operative before any of the present members of
D01 1650 12    it came into it. It is they, of course, who keep it
D01 1660 11    alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue
D01 1670  7    to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find
D01 1680  4    as they come into it.
