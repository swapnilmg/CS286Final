H21 0010  1       Strategy and tactics of the U.S. military forces
H21 0010  9    are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions
H21 0020  7    in history. The change of emphasis from conventional-type
H21 0030  5    to missile-type warfare must be made with care, mindful
H21 0040  4    that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected
H21 0050  1    in favor of the other. Our military forces must be
H21 0050 11    capable of contending successfully with any contingency
H21 0060  6    which may be forced upon us, from limited emergencies
H21 0070  5    to all-out nuclear general war.
H21 0070 11    #FORCES AND MILITARY PERSONNEL STRENGTH.#
H21 0080  5    - This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961
H21 0090  5    for the continued support of our forces at approximately
H21 0100  1    the present level- a year-end strength of 2,489,000
H21 0100 10    men and women in the active forces. The forces to be
H21 0110 10    supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000
H21 0120  6    men; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men; a
H21 0130  4    Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000
H21 0140  1    men; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000
H21 0140 12    men.
H21 0150  1       If the reserve components are to serve effectively
H21 0150  9    in time of war, their basic organization and objectives
H21 0160  6    must conform to the changing character and missions
H21 0170  4    of the active forces. Quality and combat readiness
H21 0180  1    must take precedence over mere numbers. Under modern
H21 0180  9    conditions, this is especially true of the ready reserve.
H21 0190  9    I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine
H21 0200  6    the roles and missions of the reserve components in
H21 0210  3    relation to those of the active forces and in the light
H21 0220  1    of the changing requirements of modern warfare.
H21 0220  8       Last year the Congress discontinued its previously
H21 0230  6    imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the
H21 0240  4    Army Reserve. Similar restrictions on the strength
H21 0250  2    of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department
H21 0260  1    of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped.
H21 0260  9    I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance
H21 0270  7    of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components
H21 0280  7    so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments
H21 0290  4    in keeping with military necessity.
H21 0290  9       I again proposed a reduction in the Army National
H21 0300  8    Guard and Army Reserve- from their present strengths
H21 0310  7    of 400,000 and 300,000, respectively, to 360,000 and
H21 0320  4    270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961. These strengths
H21 0330  2    are considered adequate to meet the essential roles
H21 0330 10    and missions of the reserves in support of our national
H21 0340  9    security objectives.
H21 0350  1    #MILITARY PERSONNEL COSTS.#
H21 0350  4    - About 30% of the expenditures for the Department
H21 0360  3    of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs,
H21 0370  1    including pay for active, reserve, and retired military
H21 0370  9    personnel. These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1
H21 0380  7    billion, an increase of $187 million over 1960, reflecting
H21 0390  5    additional longevity pay of career personnel, more
H21 0400  2    dependents, an increased number of men drawing proficiency
H21 0410  1    pay, and social security tax increases (effective for
H21 0410  9    the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in
H21 0420  9    1960). Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million
H21 0430  5    in 1961 over 1960, partly because of a substantial
H21 0440  1    increase in the number of retired personnel. These
H21 0440  9    increased costs are partially offset by a decrease
H21 0450  7    of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces,
H21 0460  5    largely because of the planned reduction in strength
H21 0470  1    of the Army Reserve components during 1961.
H21 0470  8       Traditionally, rates of pay for retired military
H21 0480  7    personnel have been proportionate to current rates
H21 0490  4    of pay for active personnel. The 1958 military pay
H21 0500  2    act departed from this established formula by providing
H21 0500 10    for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase
H21 0510  7    for everyone retired prior to its effective date of
H21 0520  6    June 1, 1958. I endorse pending legislation that will
H21 0530  3    restore the traditional relationship between retired
H21 0530  9    and active duty pay rates.
H21 0540  5    #OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.#
H21 0540  8    - Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations
H21 0550  7    and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to
H21 0560  5    be $10.3 billion in 1961, which is $184 million more
H21 0570  3    than in 1960. The increase stems largely from the growing
H21 0580  1    complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required
H21 0580  9    for newer weapons and equipment.
H21 0590  3       A substantial increase is estimated in the cost
H21 0600  2    of operating additional communications systems in the
H21 0600  9    air defense program, as well as in all programs where
H21 0610  9    speed and security of communications are essential.
H21 0620  3    Also, the program for fleet modernization will be stepped
H21 0630  4    up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures. Further
H21 0640  1    increases arise from the civilian employee health program
H21 0640  9    enacted by the Congress last year.
H21 0650  6       Other factors increasing operating costs include
H21 0660  3    the higher unit cost of each flying hour, up 11% in
H21 0660 14    two years, and of each steaming hour, up 15%. In total,
H21 0670 11    these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings
H21 0680  7    that result from declining programs and from economy
H21 0690  5    measures, such as reduced numbers of units and installations,
H21 0700  3    smaller inventories of major equipment, and improvements
H21 0710  1    in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed
H21 0710 10    Forces.
H21 0720  1       In the budget message for 1959, and again for 1960,
H21 0720 11    I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the
H21 0730  8    Act of September 28, 1951 (65 Stat. 365). This section
H21 0740  6    prevents the military departments and the Office of
H21 0750  4    Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain
H21 0760  1    transactions involving real property unless they come
H21 0760  8    into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services
H21 0770  7    of the Senate and the House of Representatives. As
H21 0780  4    I have stated previously, the Attorney General has
H21 0790  3    advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional
H21 0800  1    principles. Accordingly, if it is not repealed by the
H21 0800 10    Congress at its present session, I shall have no alternative
H21 0810 10    thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to
H21 0820  8    disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction
H21 0830  6    determines otherwise.
H21 0830  8       Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now
H21 0840  8    provided through Federal facilities operated by the
H21 0850  5    Army, Air Force, and Federal Aviation Agency. The growing
H21 0860  4    communications needs of this new State can best be
H21 0870  2    met, as they have in other States, through the operation
H21 0870 12    and development of such facilities by private enterprise.
H21 0880  7    Legislation has already been proposed to authorize
H21 0890  5    the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska,
H21 0900  4    and its early enactment is desirable.
H21 0900 10    #PROCUREMENT, RESEARCH, AND CONSTRUCTION.#
H21 0910  4    - Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department
H21 0920  4    of Defense are for procurement, research, development,
H21 0930  2    and construction programs. In 1961, these expenditures
H21 0940  1    are estimated at $18.9 billion, compared to $19.3 billion
H21 0940 10    in 1960. The decreases, which are largely in construction
H21 0950  7    and in aircraft procurement, are offset in part by
H21 0960  6    increases for research and development and for procurement
H21 0970  3    of other military equipment such as tanks, vehicles,
H21 0980  1    guns, and electronic devices. Expenditures for shipbuilding
H21 0980  8    are estimated at about the same level as in 1960.
H21 0990  9       New obligational authority for 1961 recommended
H21 1000  4    in this budget for aircraft procurement (excluding
H21 1010  1    amounts for related research and construction) totals
H21 1010  8    $4,753 million, which is $1,390 million below that
H21 1020  8    enacted for 1960. On the other hand, the new authority
H21 1030  6    of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement
H21 1040  2    (excluding research and construction) in 1961 is $581
H21 1040 10    million higher than for 1960. These contrasting trends
H21 1050  8    in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the
H21 1060  6    composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the
H21 1070  4    years ahead.
H21 1070  6       The Department of Defense appropriation acts for
H21 1080  3    the past several years have contained a rider which
H21 1090  1    limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries
H21 1090  9    on certain military supply items. As I have repeatedly
H21 1100  8    stated, this provision is much more restrictive than
H21 1110  5    the general law, popularly known as the Buy American
H21 1120  2    Act. I urge once again that the Congress not reenact
H21 1130  1    this rider.
H21 1130  3       The task of providing a reasonable level of military
H21 1140  1    strength, without endangering other vital aspects of
H21 1140  8    our security, is greatly complicated by the swift pace
H21 1150  8    of scientific progress. The last few years have witnessed
H21 1160  6    what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military
H21 1170  3    technology in history. Some weapons systems have become
H21 1180  2    obsolescent while still in production, and some while
H21 1180 10    still under development.
H21 1190  2       Furthermore, unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological
H21 1200  2    break-through on any one weapon system, in itself,
H21 1200 11    often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive
H21 1210  8    systems. This has necessitated a continuous review
H21 1220  6    and reevaluation of the defense program in order to
H21 1230  5    redirect resources to the newer and more important
H21 1240  1    weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on
H21 1240 10    weapons systems which have been overtaken by events.
H21 1250  7    Thus, in the last few years, a number of programs which
H21 1260  5    looked very promising at the time their development
H21 1270  1    was commenced have since been completely eliminated.
H21 1270  8    For example, the importance of the Regulus II, a very
H21 1280  9    promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed
H21 1290  6    to be launched by surfaced submarines, was greatly
H21 1300  3    diminished by the successful acceleration of the much
H21 1300 11    more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by
H21 1310  7    submerged submarines.
H21 1320  1       Another example is the recent cancellation of the
H21 1320  9    F-108, a long-range interceptor with a speed three
H21 1330  9    times as great as the speed of sound, which was designed
H21 1340  6    for use against manned bombers in the period of the
H21 1350  4    mid-1960's. The substantial progress being made in
H21 1350 12    ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the
H21 1360  7    main threat from manned bombers to missiles. Considering
H21 1370  5    the high cost of the F-108 system- over $4 billion
H21 1380  4    for the force that had been planned- and the time period
H21 1390  4    in which it would become operational, it was decided
H21 1390 13    to stop further work on the project. Meanwhile, other
H21 1400  9    air defense forces are being made effective, as described
H21 1410  7    later in this message.
H21 1420  1       The size and scope of other important programs have
H21 1420 10    been reduced from earlier plans. Notable in this category
H21 1430  7    are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic
H21 1440  4    missiles, which have been successfully developed, produced,
H21 1450  2    and deployed, but the relative importance of which
H21 1460  1    has diminished with the increasing availability of
H21 1460  8    the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile.
H21 1470  3       The impact of technological factors is also illustrated
H21 1480  4    by the history of the high-energy fuel program. This
H21 1490  2    project was started at a time when there was a critical
H21 1490 13    need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin
H21 1500 10    of range for high performance aircraft, particularly
H21 1510  3    our heavy bombers. Continuing technical problems involved
H21 1520  3    in the use of this fuel, coupled with significant improvements
H21 1530  2    in aircraft range through other means, have now raised
H21 1530 11    serious questions about the value of the high-energy
H21 1540  9    fuel program. As a result, the scope of this project
H21 1550  8    has been sharply curtailed.
H21 1560  1       These examples underscore the importance of even
H21 1560  7    more searching evaluations of new major development
H21 1570  5    programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging
H21 1580  3    analyses of the potentialities of future technology.
H21 1580 10    The cost of developing a major weapon system is now
H21 1590 10    so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised
H21 1600  6    in selecting new systems for development, in determining
H21 1610  3    the most satisfactory rate of development, and in deciding
H21 1620  2    the proper time at which either to place a system into
H21 1620 13    production or to abandon it.
H21 1630  5    #STRATEGIC FORCES.#
H21 1630  7    - The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from
H21 1640  7    both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their
H21 1650  3    capability to conduct other essential operations in
H21 1650 10    any form of war. The first capability is represented
H21 1660  9    by a combination of manned bombers, carrier-based aircraft,
H21 1670  7    and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles.
H21 1680  3    The second capability is represented by our deployed
H21 1690  2    ground, naval, and air forces in essential forward
H21 1690 10    areas, together with ready reserves capable of effecting
H21 1700  7    early emergency reinforcement.
H21 1710  1       The Strategic Air Command is the principal element
H21 1720  1    of our long-range nuclear capability. One of the important
H21 1720 11    and difficult decisions which had to be made in this
H21 1730  9    budget concerned the role of the B-70, a long-range
H21 1740  8    supersonic bomber. This aircraft, which was planned
H21 1750  3    for initial operational use about 1965, would be complementary
H21 1760  1    to but likewise competitive with the four strategic
H21 1760  9    ballistic missile systems, all of which are scheduled
H21 1770  7    to become available earlier. The first Atlas ICBM's
H21 1780  5    are now operational, the first two Polaris submarines
H21 1790  3    are expected to be operational this calendar year,
H21 1800  1    and the first Titan ICBM's next year. The Minuteman
H21 1800 10    solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about
H21 1810  8    mid-1963. By 1965, several or all of these systems
H21 1820  8    will have been fully tested and their reliability established.
H21 1830  4       Thus, the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon
H21 1840  5    system is doubtful. However, I am recommending that
H21 1850  2    development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines
H21 1850 12    be continued. It is expected that in 1963 two prototype
H21 1860  9    aircraft will be available for flight testing. By that
H21 1870  6    time we should be in a much better position to determine
H21 1880  4    the value of that aircraft as a weapon system.
H21 1890  1       I am recommending additional acquisitions of the
H21 1890  8    improved version of the B-52 (the B-52H with the
H21 1900 10    new turbofan engine) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic
H21 1910  8    medium bomber, together with the supporting refueling
H21 1920  4    tankers in each case. These additional modern bombers
H21 1930  2    will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers;
H21 1940  1    one B-52 can do the work of several B-47's which
H21 1940 13    it will replace. Funds are also included in this budget
H21 1950  8    to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the
H21 1960  8    Hound Dog air-to-surface missile.
H21 1970  1       In the coming fiscal year additional quantities
H21 1970  8    of Atlas, Titan, and Polaris missiles also will be
H21 1980  7    procured.
