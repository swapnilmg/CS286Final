A44 0010  1       EVERY library borrower, or at least those whose
A44 0010  9    taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows
A44 0020  8    what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically,
A44 0030  3    "I'm sorry, but we don't have that book. There wouldn't
A44 0040  4    be much demand for it, I'm afraid".
A44 0050  1       Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the
A44 0050 10    ever-present budget problem all libraries must face,
A44 0060  6    from the largest to the smallest. What to buy out of
A44 0070  6    the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles? What
A44 0080  2    to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction
A44 0080 13    and nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly
A44 0090  9    diversified, when your budget is pitifully small? Most
A44 0100  7    library budgets are hopelessly inadequate. A startlingly
A44 0110  4    high percentage do not exceed $500 annually, which
A44 0120  2    includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New
A44 0130  1    York Public has enough money to meet its needs- this
A44 0130 11    in the world's richest city. The plight of a small
A44 0140  8    community library is proportionately worse.
A44 0150  2       Confronted with this situation, most libraries either
A44 0160  2    endure the severe limitations of their budgets and
A44 0160 10    do what they can with what they have, or else depend
A44 0170  9    on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement
A44 0180  5    their annual funds. In some parts of the country, however,
A44 0190  4    a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under the
A44 0200  2    wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial
A44 0200 10    help of the state, libraries share their book resources
A44 0210  7    on a county-wide or regional basis.
A44 0220  2       New York State has what is probably the most advanced
A44 0230  1    of these co-operative systems, so well developed that
A44 0230 10    it has become a model for others to follow. Because
A44 0240  8    it is so large a state, with marked contrasts in population
A44 0250  5    density, the organization of the New York co-operative
A44 0260  4    offers a cross-section of how the plan works. At one
A44 0270  2    extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where
A44 0270 12    libraries in two or more counties combine to serve
A44 0280  9    a large, sparsely populated area. At the other are
A44 0290  6    organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library
A44 0300  1    System, in a high-density area, with ample resources
A44 0300 10    and a rapidly growing territory to serve.
A44 0310  5       Both these types, and those in between, are in existence
A44 0320  6    by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that
A44 0330  2    began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation
A44 0330 12    by the legislature of county library systems financed
A44 0340  7    by county governments with matching funds from the
A44 0350  6    state. It was a step in the right direction, but it
A44 0360  3    took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish
A44 0360 12    fully the thriving systems of today.
A44 0370  6       Under this law annual grants are given to systems
A44 0380  4    in substantial amounts. An earlier difficulty was overcome
A44 0390  2    by making it clear that individual libraries in any
A44 0390 11    area might join or not, as they saw fit. Some library
A44 0400 10    boards are wary of the plan. A large, well-stocked
A44 0410  6    library, surrounded in a county by smaller ones, may
A44 0420  3    feel that the demands on its resources are likely to
A44 0420 13    be too great. A small library may cherish its independence
A44 0430  9    and established ways, and resist joining in a cooperative
A44 0440  8    movement that sometimes seems radical to older members
A44 0450  5    of the board.
A44 0450  8       Within a system, however, the autonomy of each member
A44 0460  6    library is preserved. The local community maintains
A44 0470  2    responsibility for the financial support of its own
A44 0470 10    library program, facilities, and services, but wider
A44 0480  7    resources and additional services become available
A44 0490  4    through membership in a system. All services are given
A44 0500  4    without cost to members. So obvious are these advantages
A44 0510  1    that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York
A44 0510 12    State now has access to a system, and enthusiastic
A44 0520  9    librarians foresee the day, not too distant, when all
A44 0530  6    the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op.
A44 0540  4    ##
A44 0540  5    TO SET up a co-operative library system, the law requires
A44 0550  2    a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes
A44 0550 10    as the nucleus, and the system is organized around
A44 0560  9    it. The collection may be in an existing library, or
A44 0570  7    it may be built up in a central collection. Each system
A44 0580  3    develops differently, according to the area it serves,
A44 0590  1    but the universal goal is to pool the resources of
A44 0590 11    a given area for maximum efficiency. The basic state
A44 0600  6    grant is thirty cents for each person served, and there
A44 0610  5    is a further book incentive grant that provides an
A44 0620  2    extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if
A44 0620 12    a library spends a certain number of dollars.
A44 0630  6       In Nassau County, for example, the heavily settled
A44 0640  4    Long Island suburb of New York City, the system is
A44 0650  3    credited by the state with serving one million persons,
A44 0650 12    a figure that has doubled since 1950. This system,
A44 0660  8    by virtue of its variety and size, offers an inclusive
A44 0670  6    view of the plan in operation.
A44 0680  1       The Nassau system recognizes that its major task
A44 0680  9    it to broaden reference service, what with the constant
A44 0690  6    expansion of education and knowledge, and the pressure
A44 0700  4    of population growth in a metropolitan area. The need
A44 0710  2    is for reference works of a more specialized nature
A44 0710 11    than individual libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday
A44 0720  6    needs, could afford. Nassau is currently building a
A44 0730  5    central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead
A44 0740  4    headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000
A44 0750  1    volumes by 1965.
A44 0750  4       The major part of this collection is in the central
A44 0760  2    headquarters building, and the remainder is divided
A44 0760  9    among five libraries in the system designated as subject
A44 0770  8    centers. Basic reference tools are the backbone of
A44 0790  6    the collection, but there is also specialization in
A44 0800  2    science and technology, an indicated weakness in local
A44 0800 10    libraries. On microfilm, headquarters also has a file
A44 0810  8    of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to
A44 0820  8    the present day, as well as bound volumes of important
A44 0830  4    periodicals. The entire headquarters collection is
A44 0840  2    available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary
A44 0840 11    loans.
A44 0850  1       Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day.
A44 0850  8    It is connected by teletype with the State Library
A44 0860  7    in Albany, which will supply any book to a system that
A44 0870  6    the system itself cannot provide. The books are carried
A44 0880  2    around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to
A44 0880 11    the other libraries.
A44 0890  2       Each subject center library was chosen because of
A44 0900  2    its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which
A44 0900 10    headquarters could then build upon. East Meadow has
A44 0910  8    philosophy, psychology, and religion; Freeport houses
A44 0920  4    social science, pure science, and language; history,
A44 0930  2    biography, and education are centered in Hempstead;
A44 0930  9    Levittown has applied science, business, and literature;
A44 0940  7    while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art, music,
A44 0950  7    and foreign languages. The reference coordinator at
A44 0960  5    headquarters also serves as a consultant, and is available
A44 0970  4    to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen
A44 0980  1    local reference service.
A44 0980  4       This kind of cooperation is not wholly new, of course.
A44 0990  5    Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending
A44 1000  2    books to each other by mail for a quarter-century,
A44 1000 12    but the system enables this process to operate on an
A44 1010  8    organized and far more comprehensive basis. Local libraries
A44 1020  4    find, too, that the new plan saves tax dollars because
A44 1030  4    books can be bought through the system, and since the
A44 1040  2    system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts
A44 1040 13    than would be available to an individual library. The
A44 1050  8    system passes on these savings to its members. Further
A44 1060  6    money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical
A44 1070  3    detail as the result of central billing.
A44 1080  1       Books are not the only resource of the system. Schools
A44 1080 11    and community groups turn to the headquarters film
A44 1090  7    library for documentary, art, and experimental films
A44 1100  4    to show at libraries that sponsor local programs, and
A44 1110  2    to organizations in member communities. The most recent
A44 1110 10    film catalogue, available at each library, lists 110
A44 1120  8    titles presently in the collection, any of which may
A44 1130  6    be borrowed without charge. This catalogue lists separately
A44 1140  3    films suitable for children, young adults, or adults,
A44 1150  1    although some classics cut across age groups, such
A44 1150  9    as "Nanook of the North", "The Emperor's Nightingale",
A44 1160  7    and "The Red Balloon". Workshops are conducted by the
A44 1170  8    system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of
A44 1180  6    member libraries, teaching them the effective use of
A44 1190  3    film as a library service.
A44 1190  8       The system well understands that one of its primary
A44 1200  6    responsibilities is to bring children and books together;
A44 1210  4    consequently an experienced children's librarian at
A44 1220  2    headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to
A44 1220  9    promote well-planned library activities, cooperating
A44 1230  4    with the children's librarians in member libraries
A44 1240  4    by means of individual conferences, workshops, and
A44 1250  2    frequent visits. Headquarters has also set up a central
A44 1250 11    juvenile book-review and book-selection center, to
A44 1260  8    provide better methods of purchasing and selection.
A44 1270  4    Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters,
A44 1280  3    where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or
A44 1280 11    in workshop groups. Story hours, pre-school programs,
A44 1290  8    activities with community agencies, and lists of recommended
A44 1300  7    reading are all in the province of the children's consultant.
A44 1310  5       Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly
A44 1320  5    busy place these days, threatening to expand beyond
A44 1330  2    its boundaries. In addition to the interlibrary loan
A44 1330 10    service and the children's program, headquarters has
A44 1340  7    a public relations director who seeks to get wider
A44 1350  7    grassroots support for quality library service in the
A44 1360  4    county; it prepares cooperative displays (posters,
A44 1370  1    booklists, brochures, and other promotional material)
A44 1370  7    for use in mber libraries; it maintains a central
A44 1380  6    exhibi/t collection to share displays already created
A44 1390  3    and used; and it publishes Sum and Substance, a monthly
A44 1400  3    newsletter, which reports the system's activities to
A44 1410  1    the staffs and trustees of member libraries. The system
A44 1410 10    itself is governed by a board of trustees, geographically
A44 1420  7    representing its membership.
A44 1430  1       In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective
A44 1440  1    is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear
A44 1440 11    on the schools, and on adult education in general.
A44 1450  6    Librarians, a patient breed of men and women who have
A44 1460  5    borne much with dedication, can begin to see results
A44 1470  1    today. Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk
A44 1470 10    of the newcomers are those maligned Americans, the
A44 1480  6    teen-agers. To them especially the librarians, with
A44 1490  4    the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to say,
A44 1500  2    "I'm sorry, we don't have that book".
A44 1510  1       TODAY, more than ever before, the survival of our
A44 1510 10    free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed
A44 1520  9    and concerned. The great advances made in recent years
A44 1530  7    in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy
A44 1540  5    require an educated citizenry in the Western world.
A44 1550  2    The need for lifetime reading is apparent. Education
A44 1550 10    must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing
A44 1560 11    process through our entire lives, for it is only through
A44 1570  8    knowledge that we, as a nation, can cope with the dangers
A44 1580  6    that threaten our society.
A44 1580 10       The desire and ability to read are important aspects
A44 1590  8    of our cultural life. We cannot consider ourselves
A44 1600  4    educated if we do not read; if we are not discriminating
A44 1610  2    in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we
A44 1620  1    do read. We must not permit our society to become a
A44 1620 12    slave to the scientific age, as might well happen without
A44 1630  7    the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from
A44 1640  4    the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed
A44 1650  2    from the written word.
A44 1650  6       A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today
A44 1660  5    is the book found in our libraries. Although progress
A44 1670  2    has been made in America's system of libraries it still
A44 1680  1    falls short of what is required if we are to maintain
A44 1680 12    the standards that are needed for an informed America.
A44 1690  7    The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge,
A44 1700  6    and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the
A44 1710  3    written word, continue to expand. The inadequacy of
A44 1710 11    our library system will become critical unless we act
A44 1720  9    vigorously to correct this condition. There are, for
A44 1730  6    example, approximately 25,000,000 people in this country
A44 1740  5    with no public library service and about 50,000,000
A44 1750  1    with inadequate service. In college libraries, 57 per
A44 1750  9    cent of the total number of books are owned by 124
A44 1760  9    of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S.
A44 1770  6    Office of Education. And over 66 per cent of the elementary
A44 1780  5    schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library
A44 1790  2    at all.
A44 1790  4    ##
A44 1790  5    IN every aspect of service- to the public, to children
A44 1800  3    in schools, to colleges and universities- the library
A44 1810  1    of today is failing to render vitally needed services.
A44 1810 10    Only public understanding and support can provide that
A44 1820  7    service.
A44 1820  8       This is one of the main reasons for National Library
A44 1830  9    Week, April 16-22, and for its theme: "For a richer,
A44 1840  7    fuller life, read"!
