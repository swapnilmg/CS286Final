F14 0010  1    Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate
F14 0010 10    had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective
F14 0020  9    dirge. For almost two months, the defendant and the
F14 0030  5    world heard from individuals escaped from the grave
F14 0040  2    about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents,
F14 0040  8    babies, starved, beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned,
F14 0050  7    gassed, burned. One who had been a boy in Auschwitz
F14 0060  8    had to tell how children had been selected by height
F14 0070  3    for the gas chambers. The gruesome humor of the Nazis
F14 0080  1    was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it
F14 0080 12    with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a
F14 0090  8    copper Star of David- nor the gratuitous sadism of
F14 0100  5    SS officers. Public relations strategists everywhere,
F14 0110  2    watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal
F14 0120  1    press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their
F14 0120  9    neighbors, studying interviews with men and women on
F14 0130  7    the street, cried out: Too much, too much- the mind
F14 0140  5    of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors are
F14 0150  2    losing their effect. And still another witness, one
F14 0150 10    who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses, had
F14 0160  9    to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves
F14 0170  6    head to foot one on top of the other before being shot.
F14 0180  3    ...
F14 0180  4       Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible
F14 0190  2    as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi
F14 0200  1    crime but seemed subject to question when not tied
F14 0200 10    to the part in it of the defendant's Department of
F14 0210  6    Jewish Affairs. Counsel for the defense, however, shrewdly
F14 0220  4    allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful
F14 0230  3    recollections, rarely raised an objection. Would not
F14 0230 10    the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this
F14 0240  8    awfulness have a calming, if not exhausting, effect
F14 0250  5    likely to improve his client's chances? Those who feared
F14 0260  4    "emotionalism" at the Trial showed less understanding
F14 0270  2    than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves
F14 0280  1    the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies.
F14 0280  8    Interruptions came largely from the bench, which numerous
F14 0300  7    times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his
F14 0310  5    witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious effort
F14 0320  2    to choke off the flow.
F14 0320  7       But there was a contrast even more decisive than
F14 0330  4    a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and
F14 0340  2    those in Moscow and New York. In each of the last,
F14 0340 13    the trial marked the beginning of a new course: in
F14 0350  9    Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the
F14 0360  7    tightening of Stalin's dictatorship; in the United
F14 0370  4    States the initiation of militant anti-Communism, with
F14 0380  2    the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard. These trials
F14 0380 11    were properly termed "political cases" in that the
F14 0390  8    trial itself was a political act producing political
F14 0400  6    consequences. But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate?
F14 0410  4    Of what new course could it mark the beginning? The
F14 0420  2    Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.
F14 0430  1    It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process
F14 0430 12    of tragic recollection, and of refining the recollection,
F14 0440  6    that will last as long as there are Jews. As such,
F14 0450  5    it was beyond politics and had no need of justification
F14 0460  1    by a "message".
F14 0460  4    ##
F14 0460  5    "IT IS NOT AN individual that is in the dock at this
F14 0470  8    historical trial"- said Ben Gurion, "and not the Nazi
F14 0480  5    regime alone- but anti-Semitism throughout history".
F14 0490  2    How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which
F14 0490 11    to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder
F14 0500  9    of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute
F14 0510  7    to a verdict against anti-Semitism? And if it was not
F14 0520  6    an individual who was in the dock, why was the Trial,
F14 0530  4    as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the
F14 0540  1    attempt to prove Eichmann a "fiend"? These questions
F14 0540  9    touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case.
F14 0550  8       It might be contended, of course, that Eichmann
F14 0560  5    in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying
F14 0570  4    or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.
F14 0580  1    But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind
F14 0580 13    of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the
F14 0590  9    indictment. In such a case the defendant should serve
F14 0600  5    as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue
F14 0610  4    by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism
F14 0620  1    only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good
F14 0620 10    specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout
F14 0630  7    at Eichmann though he might, the Prosecutor could not
F14 0640  5    establish that the defendant was falsifying the way
F14 0650  3    he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into
F14 0650 15    the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism.
F14 0660  6    Yes, he believed that the Jews were "enemies of the
F14 0670  6    Reich", and such a belief is, of course, typical of
F14 0680  3    "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy
F14 0690  4    in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member
F14 0700  1    of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The
F14 0700 11    real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism
F14 0710  7    of this sort to murder, and the answer to this question
F14 0720  4    is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In regard
F14 0725  2    to Eichmann, it was to be found in the Nazi outlook,
F14 0730 10    which contained a principle separate from and far worse
F14 0740  8    than anti-Semitism, a principle by which the poison
F14 0750  6    of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent. Perhaps
F14 0760  2    under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,
F14 0770  1    as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward
F14 0770  8    the Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear
F14 0780 10    of disobeying orders, as Eichmann kept trying to explain,
F14 0790  7    but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance
F14 0800  7    of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation
F14 0810  5    of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories
F14 0820  2    into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical
F14 0830  1    rightness that was able to respond to any proposal,
F14 0830 10    and the more outrageous the better, "Well, let's try
F14 0840  6    it". At any rate, the substance of Eichmann's testimony
F14 0850  4    was that all his actions flowed from his membership
F14 0860  3    in the party and the SS, and though the Prosecutor
F14 0870  1    did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews,
F14 0870 11    his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic
F14 0880 10    lesson weakened to that extent.
F14 0890  3    ##
F14 0890  4    BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania
F14 0900  3    so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it
F14 0900 15    happened to light, neither did it warn very effectively
F14 0910  9    against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis
F14 0920  7    made such effective use in Germany and wherever else
F14 0930  4    they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial in
F14 0940  2    Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough
F14 0940 11    emphasis to capture the notice of the world press,
F14 0950  9    in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's
F14 0960  4    Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified by the
F14 0970  3    betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party
F14 0970 14    anti-Semites in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
F14 0980  9    Hungary? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich
F14 0990  8    in January 1942, to organize the material and technical
F14 1000  8    means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread
F14 1010  6    throughout the nations of Europe, was attended by representatives
F14 1020  4    of major organs of the German state, including the
F14 1030  2    Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary
F14 1030 10    in charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister
F14 1040 10    of Justice, the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
F14 1050  6    The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted
F14 1060  4    at the Conference affected industry, transportation,
F14 1070  1    civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening
F14 1070  8    the Conference, followed the reasoning and even the
F14 1080  7    phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering
F14 1090  5    which authorized the Final Solution as " a complement
F14 1100  4    to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews from
F14 1110  2    German living space through violence, economic strangulation,
F14 1120  1    forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words,
F14 1120  8    the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that
F14 1130  8    physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension
F14 1140  5    of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every
F14 1150  3    phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted
F14 1150 13    on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures
F14 1160 10    effective, as a readiness for murder. This, in fact,
F14 1170  8    it turned out to be. Since the magnitude of the plan
F14 1180  6    made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had began
F14 1190  2    to turn, persons controlling German industries, social
F14 1190  9    institutions, and armed forces became, through their
F14 1200  7    anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it, conscious accomplices
F14 1210  6    of Hitler's crimes; whether in the last degree or a
F14 1220  7    lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.
F14 1230  1       What more could be asked for a Trial intended to
F14 1230 11    warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity
F14 1240  9    to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite
F14 1250  8    and the concentration-camp brute? Not in Eichmann's
F14 1260  5    anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober
F14 1270  4    German man of affairs lay the potential warning of
F14 1280  2    the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third
F14 1280 13    Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent"
F14 1290  8    dislike of Jews, as do others like them today. The
F14 1300  8    Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety
F14 1310  6    exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality
F14 1320  2    and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial
F14 1320 11    have made every effort to demonstrate this once and
F14 1330  9    for all by showing how representative types of "mere"
F14 1340  5    anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program
F14 1350  5    of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor in his
F14 1360  3    opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"
F14 1370  1    among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed".
F14 1370  9    But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over
F14 1380 11    Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies
F14 1390  7    where he functioned, the press seems to have missed
F14 1400  5    it.
F14 1400  6    ##
F14 1400  7    NOR DID THE Trial devote much attention to exposing
F14 1410  4    the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis, both
F14 1420  2    in building their own power and in destroying that
F14 1420 11    of rival organizations and states. Certainly, one of
F14 1430  6    the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism
F14 1440  5    is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon.
F14 1450  2    Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the
F14 1450 13    enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man
F14 1460  9    of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors.
F14 1470  8    Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution
F14 1480  6    of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries
F14 1490  4    contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting
F14 1500  1    apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest
F14 1500  8    and most dishonest impulses, pulverizing trust and
F14 1510  5    personal dignity, and finally forcing people to follow
F14 1520  5    their masters into the abyss by making them partners
F14 1530  2    in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made
F14 1530 10    the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization:
F14 1540  8    fearful of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection
F14 1550 10    in his Nazi uniform; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea,
F14 1560  7    he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness;
F14 1570  4    once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal
F14 1580  4    opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania
F14 1590  1    and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen
F14 1590 13    you desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations.
F14 1600  9    But though this characterization in no way diminished
F14 1610  6    Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, more deeply involved
F14 1620  4    in the tactics of a criminal case than a political
F14 1630  2    one, would have none of it.
F14 1630  8       Finally, if the mission of the Trial was to convict
F14 1640  7    anti-Semitism, how could it have failed to post before
F14 1650  4    the world the contrasting fates of the countries in
F14 1650 13    which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters-
F14 1660 10    i.e., Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and
F14 1670  6    those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity-
F14 1680  7    Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, France? Should not
F14 1690  4    everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding
F14 1700  2    fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism
F14 1710  1    proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom
F14 1710 10    than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots
F14 1720  6    from the transports? Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's
F14 1730  5    experience in various countries worth highlighting?
F14 1750  1    ##
F14 1750  2    AS THE FIRST collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage,
F14 1760  5    the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the
F14 1770  3    Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery
F14 1770 13    that took fifteen years and which is still by no means
F14 1780  9    complete (though let no one believe that it could be
F14 1790  6    hastened by silence). Only across a distance of time
F14 1800  3    could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult
F14 1800 12    to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what
F14 1810 11    had been done to the Jews of Europe. It is not that
F14 1820  9    the facts of the persecution were unavailable; most
F14 1830  3    of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought
F14 1840  3    to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals
F14 1840 12    and investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs,
F14 1850  7    and survivors' accounts.
