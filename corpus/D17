D17 0010  1    I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts; this issue
D17 0010 11    that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary.
D17 0020  6       When I came into being, 15 years ago, I had one
D17 0030  6    primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere to
D17 0040  2    know God better, and through knowing Him better to
D17 0040 11    become happier and more effective people. That purpose
D17 0050  7    has never changed.
D17 0060  1       When you read me, you are holding in your hands
D17 0060 11    the product of many minds and hearts. Some of the people
D17 0070  8    who speak through my pages are famous; others unknown.
D17 0080  4    Some work with their hands. Some have walked through
D17 0090  2    pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope.
D17 0090 12    Some are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of
D17 0100 10    life and the love of God, that their joy spills out
D17 0110  6    on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom
D17 0120  2    they have never known, and will never see.
D17 0120 10       Fifteen years ago, there were no Guideposts at all.
D17 0130  9    This month a million Guideposts will circulate all
D17 0140  5    over the world. Experts in the publishing field consider
D17 0150  3    this astounding. They do not understand how a small
D17 0160  1    magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale
D17 0160  9    could have achieved such a following.
D17 0170  4       To me, the explanation is very simple. I am not
D17 0180  3    doing anything, of myself. I am merely a channel for
D17 0180 13    ... something.
D17 0190  1       What is this something? I cannot define it fully.
D17 0200  1    It is the force in the universe that makes men love
D17 0200 12    goodness, even when they turn away from it. It is the
D17 0210 10    power that holds the stars in their orbits, but allows
D17 0220  5    the wind to bend a blade of grass. It is the whisper
D17 0230  2    in the heart that urges each one to be better than
D17 0230 13    he is. It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world
D17 0240  8    of justice and peace.
D17 0250  1       All things are possible to God, but He chooses-
D17 0250 10    usually- to work through people. Sometimes such people
D17 0260  7    sense that they are being used; sometimes not.
D17 0270  4       Fifteen years ago, troubled by the rising tide of
D17 0280  3    materialism in the post-war world, a businessman and
D17 0280 12    a minister asked themselves if there might not be a
D17 0290  9    place for a small magazine in which men and women,
D17 0300  6    regardless of creed or color, could set forth boldly
D17 0310  3    their religious convictions and bear witness to the
D17 0310 11    power of faith to solve the endless problems of living.
D17 0320 10       The businessman was Raymond Thornburg. The minister
D17 0330  6    was Norman Vincent Peale. Neither had any publishing
D17 0340  5    experience, but they had faith in their idea. They
D17 0350  3    borrowed a typewriter, raised about $2,000 in contributions,
D17 0360  1    hired a secretary, persuaded a couple of young men
D17 0360 10    to join them for almost no pay ... and began mailing
D17 0370  8    out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called
D17 0380  4    Guideposts.
D17 0380  5       Compared to the big, established magazines, my first
D17 0390  4    efforts seemed feeble indeed. But from the start they
D17 0400  3    had two important ingredients: sincerity and realism.
D17 0400 10    The people who told the stories were sincere. And the
D17 0410 10    stories they told were true.
D17 0420  3       For example, early in my life, when one of my editorial
D17 0430  1    workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic
D17 0430 10    organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers,
D17 0440 10    he didn't just ask questions. Len LeSourd went and
D17 0450  8    lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days.
D17 0460  5       That was nearly 13 years ago. Len LeSourd is my
D17 0470  4    executive editor today.
D17 0470  7       Many of you are familiar, I'm sure, with the story
D17 0480  6    of my early struggles: the fire in January, 1947, that
D17 0490  5    destroyed everything- even our precious list of subscribers.
D17 0500  3    The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere.
D17 0510  1    The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm
D17 0510 11    me.
D17 0520  1       That was when a remarkable woman, Teresa Durlach,
D17 0520  9    came to my aid- not so much with money, as with wisdom
D17 0530  9    and courage. "You're not living up to your own principles",
D17 0540  8    she told my discouraged people. "You're so preoccupied
D17 0550  4    that you've let your faith grow dim. What do you want-
D17 0560  5    a hundred thousand subscribers? Visualize them, then,
D17 0570  3    believe you are getting them, and you will have them"!
D17 0580  1       And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality. And
D17 0580  9    then 500,000. And now a million January Guideposts
D17 0590  7    are in circulation.
D17 0600  1       With our growth came expansion into new fields of
D17 0600 10    service. Today more than a thousand industries distribute
D17 0610  7    me to their employees. They say all personnel have
D17 0620  5    spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet. Hundreds
D17 0630  3    of civic clubs, business firms and individuals make
D17 0630 11    me available to school teachers throughout the land.
D17 0640  8    They say it helps them bring back into schools the
D17 0650  7    spiritual and moral values on which this country was
D17 0660  3    built.
D17 0660  4       Thousands of free copies are sent each month to
D17 0670  3    chaplains in the Armed Forces, to prison libraries
D17 0670 11    and to hospitals everywhere. Bedridden people say I
D17 0680  6    am easy to hold- and read. Three years ago it became
D17 0690  6    possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers.
D17 0700  4       Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate
D17 0710  2    for, although I have never offered great financial
D17 0710 10    inducements, talent has found its way to me: William
D17 0720  9    Boal who so ably organizes business operations; John
D17 0730  4    Beach who guides circulation; Irving Granville and
D17 0740  4    Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business
D17 0750  1    firms.
D17 0750  2       Searching for the best in spiritual stories, my
D17 0760  1    roving editors cover not only the country, but the
D17 0760 10    whole world. Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa,
D17 0770  7    once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer. Last
D17 0780  4    summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska.
D17 0790  3    Van Varner recently returned from Russia.
D17 0790  9       Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York
D17 0800 10    for an early supper, then a long evening of idea-exchange.
D17 0810  8    Around the table sit Protestant, Catholic, and Jew.
D17 0820  4    Each contributes something different, and something
D17 0830  1    important: Ruth Peale, her wide experience in church
D17 0830  9    work; Sidney Fields, years of experience as a New York
D17 0840 10    columnist; Catherine Marshall LeSourd the insight that
D17 0850  6    has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore,
D17 0860  4    the keen perception of an advertising executive.
D17 0870  2       There are people who travel long distances to assure
D17 0880  1    my continued existence. Elaine St. Johns may fly in
D17 0880 10    from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings.
D17 0890  7    Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock,
D17 0900  5    milks his family cow, attends to farm chores, and then
D17 0910  3    takes a two-hour train trip to New York. Arthur Gordon
D17 0920  1    comes once a month all the way from Georgia.
D17 0920 10       We have also seen the power of faith at work among
D17 0930  9    us. Rose Weiss, who handles all the prayer-requests
D17 0940  4    that we receive, answering each letter personally,
D17 0950  1    has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering:
D17 0950  9    she has had many major operations, and now gets about
D17 0960  8    in a limited way on braces and crutches. Recently,
D17 0970  4    John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest
D17 0980  2    forms of cancer. We prayed for John, during surgery,
D17 0980 11    we asked others to pray; all over the country a massive
D17 0990 11    shield of prayer was thrown around him. Today the cancer
D17 1000  8    is gone.
D17 1000 10       Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without
D17 1010  9    mentioning all. But, you see, those who are not mentioned
D17 1020  7    will not resent it. That is the kind of people they
D17 1030  4    are.
D17 1030  5       Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn
D17 1040  3    affairs, a little sanctimonious? Not so. Serious, yes,
D17 1050  1    but also much laughter. Sharp division of opinion,
D17 1050  9    too, and strenuous debate. There are brain-wracking
D17 1060  6    searches for the right word, the best phrase, the most
D17 1070  4    helpful idea. And there is also something intangible
D17 1080  1    that hovers around the table. A good word for it is
D17 1080 12    fellowship. A shorter word is love.
D17 1090  6       Each meeting starts with a prayer, offered spontaneously
D17 1100  2    by one member of the group. It takes many forms, this
D17 1110  2    prayer, but in essence it is always a request for guidance,
D17 1110 13    for open minds and gentle hearts, for honesty and sincerity,
D17 1120  9    for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts'
D17 1130  8    readers.
D17 1130  9       For you, readers, are an all-important part of the
D17 1140  9    spiritual experiment that is Guideposts. I need your
D17 1150  6    support, your criticism, your encouragement, your prayers.
D17 1160  3       I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts. My message,
D17 1170  3    today, is the same as it was 15 years ago: that there
D17 1180  1    is goodness in people, and strength and love in God.
D17 1180 11       May He bless you all.
D17 1200  1       HAVANA was filled with an excitement which you could
D17 1200 10    see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the
D17 1210 11    pitch of their voices. The hated dictator Batista had
D17 1220  6    fled. Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro
D17 1230  4    was on his way to Havana, coming from the mountains
D17 1240  1    where he had fought Batista for five years. Already
D17 1240 10    the city was filled with Barbudos, the bearded, war-dirty
D17 1250  8    Revolutionaries, carrying carbines, waving to the crowds
D17 1260  6    that lined the Prado.
D17 1260 10       And then Castro himself did come, bearded, smiling;
D17 1270  8    yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did
D17 1280  7    not pick up the smile on his lips.
D17 1290  1       At first I was happy to throw the support of our
D17 1290 12    newspaper behind this man. I am sure that Castro was
D17 1300 10    happy, too, about that support. Diario de la Marina
D17 1310  5    was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba,
D17 1320  3    with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.
D17 1320 11    My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials.
D17 1330  9    My own earliest memories are of exiles: my three brothers
D17 1340  8    and I were taken often to the United States "to visit
D17 1350  7    relatives" while my father stayed on to fight the dictator
D17 1360  6    Machado.
D17 1360  7       When it was my turn, I, too, printed the truth as
D17 1370  5    I knew it about Batista, and rejoiced to see his regime
D17 1380  3    topple. None of us was aware that the biggest fight
D17 1380 13    was still ahead.
D17 1390  3       I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana.
D17 1400  1    Within a week, however, I began to suspect that something
D17 1400 11    was wrong. For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom,
D17 1410  9    but hatred. He spent long hours before the TV spitting
D17 1420  7    out promises of revenge. He showed us how he dealt
D17 1430  6    with his enemies: he executed them before TV cameras.
D17 1440  3    On home sets children were watching the death throes
D17 1450  1    of men who were shot before the paredon, the firing
D17 1450 11    wall.
D17 1450 12       Castro's reforms? He seemed bent on coupling them
D17 1460  8    with vengeance. New schools were rising, but with this
D17 1470  7    went a harsh proclamation: any academic degree earned
D17 1480  4    during Batista's regime was invalid.
D17 1490  1       Economic aid? He had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily
D17 1490  8    he cut all rents in half, whether the landlord was
D17 1500  9    a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income
D17 1510  7    was the rental of a spare room. Under another law,
D17 1520  3    hundreds of farms were seized. Farm workers had their
D17 1520 12    wages cut almost in half. Of this, only 50 cents a
D17 1530 11    day was paid in cash, the rest in script usable only
D17 1540  7    in "People's Stores".
D17 1550  1       A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a
D17 1560  9    Communist. In my mind, I began to review: his use of
D17 1570  8    hate to gain support; his People's Courts; his division
D17 1580  4    of society into two classes, one the hero, the other
D17 1590  3    the villain. But most disturbing of all were the advisers
D17 1600  1    he called to sit with him in the Palace; many came
D17 1600 12    from Communist countries.
D17 1610  2       What should I do about it, I asked myself? I had
D17 1620  3    watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon.
D17 1620 11    There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him,
D17 1630 12    mobs would appear outside our windows shouting "Paredon!
D17 1640  5    Paredon! ..."
D17 1640  7       What should I do? I was proud of the new buildings
D17 1650 11    which housed Diario now: the rotogravures, gleaming
D17 1660  5    behind glass doors; the thump and whir of our new presses.
D17 1670  7    Here was a powerful, ready-made medium, but it could
D17 1680  4    speak only if I told it to.
D17 1680 11       Then one day, early in January, 1960, I sat down
D17 1690  7    at my desk, and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix.
D17 1700  4    It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had
D17 1710  1    given me. I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over
D17 1710 13    my desk to remind me always to use the power of the
D17 1720  9    paper in a Christian manner. Now it seemed almost as
D17 1730  6    if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His
D17 1740  3    eyes, saying:
D17 1740  5       "You will lose the paper. You may lose your life.
D17 1750  4    But do you have any choice"?
D17 1750 10       I knew in that moment that I did not have any choice.
D17 1760  9    From that day on I began to write editorials about
D17 1770  5    the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's
D17 1780  3    regime.
