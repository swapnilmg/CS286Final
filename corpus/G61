G61 0010  1       The turn of the century, or to be more precise,
G61 0010 11    the two decades preceeding and following it, marks
G61 0020  6    a great change in the history of early English scholarship.
G61 0030  4    At the bottom of this change were great strides forward
G61 0040  2    in the technical equipment and technical standards
G61 0040  9    of the historian. In archaeology, for example, the
G61 0050  7    contributions of Frederick Haverfield and Reginald
G61 0060  4    Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria County
G61 0070  2    Histories raised the discipline from the status of
G61 0070 10    an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable
G61 0080  9    single tool of the early English historian. And with
G61 0090  6    the publication of E. T. Leeds' Archaeology of the
G61 0100  4    Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with
G61 0110  4    an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then
G61 0120  2    known.
G61 0120  3       What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name
G61 0130  1    studies. The value of place-names in the reconstruction
G61 0130 10    of early English history had long been recognized.
G61 0140  7    Place-names, in fact, had been extensively utilized
G61 0150  5    for this purpose from the time of Camden onwards. Without
G61 0160  3    a precise knowledge of Germanic philology, however,
G61 0170  1    it is debatable whether their use was not more often
G61 0170 11    a source of confusion and error than anything else.
G61 0180  6    Even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists
G61 0190  4    as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous
G61 0200  4    errors because of their failure to recognize that modern
G61 0210  2    forms of place names are not necessarily the result
G61 0210 11    of logical philological development. It was therefore
G61 0220  6    not until the publication of J.H. Round's "The Settlement
G61 0230  6    of the South and East Saxons", and W.H. Stevenson's
G61 0240  5    "Dr. Guest and the English Conquest of South Britain",
G61 0250  5    that a scientific basis for place-name studies was
G61 0260  3    established.
G61 0260  4       Diplomatic is another area for which the dawn of
G61 0270  5    the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern
G61 0280  1    standards of scholarship. Although because of the important
G61 0280  9    achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the
G61 0290  7    field of textual criticism the advance is not so striking
G61 0300  7    as it was in the case of archaeology and place-names,
G61 0310  4    the editorial principles laid down by Stevenson in
G61 0320  1    his great edition of Asser and in his Crawford Charters
G61 0320 11    were a distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors
G61 0330  8    and remain unimproved upon today.
G61 0340  3       In sum, it can be said that the techniques and standards
G61 0350  2    of present day have their origin at the turn of the
G61 0350 13    century. And it is this, particularly the establishment
G61 0360  8    of archaeology and place-name studies on a scientific
G61 0370  7    basis, which are immediately pertinent to the Saxon
G61 0380  4    Shore.
G61 0380  5       Almost inevitably, the first result of this technological
G61 0390  4    revolution was a reaction against the methods and in
G61 0400  2    many cases the conclusions of the Oxford school of
G61 0400 11    Stubbs, Freeman and (particularly) Green regarding
G61 0410  5    the nature of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain.
G61 0420  4    Even before the century was out the tide of reaction
G61 0430  2    had set in. Charles Plummer in the introduction and
G61 0430 11    notes to his splendid edition of Bede voiced some early
G61 0440  9    doubts concerning the "elaborate superstructure" they
G61 0450  4    raised up over the slim foundations afforded by the
G61 0460  4    traditional narratives of the conquest. It was Plummer,
G61 0470  1    in fact, who coined the much quoted remark: "Mr. Green
G61 0480  1    indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing
G61 0480 12    of the Saxons and had watched every step of their subsequent
G61 0490  9    progress". Sir Henry Howorth, writing in 1898, put
G61 0500  6    himself firmly in the Lappenburg-Kemble tradition by
G61 0510  3    attacking the veracity of the West Saxon annals.
G61 0520  1       Early in the present century, W. H. Stevenson continued
G61 0530  1    the attack with a savage article against Guest. Following
G61 0530 10    him in varying degrees of scepticism were T.W. Shore,
G61 0540  7    H.M. Chadwick, Thomas Hodgkin and F. G. Beck. By 1913,
G61 0550  9    Ferdinand Lot could begin an article subtitled "La
G61 0560  7    conquete de la Grande-Bretagne par les Saxons" with
G61 0570  5    the words, "Il est difficile aujourd 'hui d'entretenir
G61 0580  3    des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel de
G61 0590  2    la conquete de la Grande-Bretagne ...". It is also
G61 0590 12    worthy of note that Lot cited both Kemble and Lappenberg
G61 0600 10    with favor in that article. It would seem that the
G61 0610  8    wheel had turned full circle.
G61 0620  1       In fact, modern scholarly opinion in the main has
G61 0620 10    not retreated all the way back to the destructive scepticism
G61 0630  9    of the first half of the nineteenth century. Although
G61 0640  4    one meets with occasional extremists like Zachrisson
G61 0650  2    or, very recently, Arthur Wade-Evans the majority of
G61 0660  1    scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes
G61 0660 10    of scepticism and gullibility. Most now admit that
G61 0670  7    Bede, Gildas, Nennius and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles
G61 0680  5    cannot be the infallible guides to early English history
G61 0690  3    that Guest, Freeman and Green thought them to be. As
G61 0700  2    R.H. Hodgkin has remarked: "The critical methods of
G61 0710  1    the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque
G61 0710  9    narrative. On the other hand, the consensus of opinion
G61 0730  8    is that, used with caution and in conjunction with
G61 0740  5    other types of evidence, the native sources still provide
G61 0750  2    a valid rough outline for the English settlement of
G61 0750 11    southern Britain. As Sir Charles Oman once said, "it
G61 0760  9    is no longer fashionable to declare that we can say
G61 0770  7    nothing certain about Old English origins".
G61 0780  2       Therefore, in one way Kemble and Lappenberg have
G61 0790  2    been vindicated. Their conclusions concerning the
G61 0790  8    untrustworthiness
G61 0800  1    of the West Saxon annals, the confused chronology of
G61 0800 10    Bede, the unreliability of the early positions of the
G61 0810  8    Anglo-Saxon genealogies and the mythological elements
G61 0820  5    contained in Nennius are now mostly accepted. Nevertheless,
G61 0830  2    in another way modern historians still labor in the
G61 0840  2    vineyard of the Oxford school. For it is their catastrophic
G61 0840 12    concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather than Kemble's
G61 0850  9    gradualist approach which dominates the field. Despite
G61 0860  7    the rejection of the traditional accounts on many points
G61 0870  5    of detail, as late as 1948 it was still possible to
G61 0880  3    postulate a massive and comparatively sudden (beginning
G61 0890  1    in ca. 450) influx of Germans as the type of invasions.
G61 0890 12       At this point, of course, the issue has become complicated
G61 0900 10    by a development unforeseen by Lappenberg and Kemble.
G61 0910  6    They, however much they were in disagreement with the
G61 0920  5    late Victorians over the method by which Britain was
G61 0930  3    Germanized, agreed with them that the end result was
G61 0930 12    the complete extinction of the previous Celtic population
G61 0950  8    and civilization. But beginning, for all practical
G61 0960  6    purposes, with Frederick Seebohm's English Village
G61 0970  3    Community scholars have had to reckon with a theory
G61 0980  4    involving institutional and agrarian continuity between
G61 0990  1    Roman and Anglo-Saxon times which is completely at
G61 0990 10    odds with the reigning concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions.
G61 1000  7    Against Seebohm formidable foes have taken the field,
G61 1010  6    notably F. W. Maitland, whose Domesday Book and Beyond
G61 1020  5    was written expressly for this purpose, and Sir Paul
G61 1030  4    Vinogradoff whose The Growth of the Manor had a similar
G61 1050  3    aim. Largely due to their efforts the catastrophic
G61 1050 11    invasion-theory has maintained its position although
G61 1060  6    Seebohm has always found supporters. H.L. Gray in his
G61 1070  6    English Field Systems and Zachrisson's Romans, Kelts
G61 1080  4    and Saxons defended in part the Seebohm thesis while
G61 1090  4    at the present time H.P.R. Finberg and Gordon Copley
G61 1100  3    seem to fall into the Celtic survivalist camp. This
G61 1110  1    is nevertheless a minority view. Most scholars, while
G61 1110  9    willing to accept a survival (revival?) of Celtic art
G61 1120  7    forms and a considerable proportion of the Celtic population,
G61 1130  5    reject any institutional legacy from pre-Anglo-Saxon
G61 1140  4    Britain.
G61 1140  5       Therefore, it is plain that the clear distinctions
G61 1150  3    of the nineteenth century are no longer with us. In
G61 1160  2    the main stream of historical thinking is a group of
G61 1160 12    scholars, H.M. Chadwick, R.H. Hodgkin, Sir Frank Stenton
G61 1170  7    et al. who are in varying degrees sceptical of the
G61 1180  9    native traditions of the conquest but who defend the
G61 1190  5    catastrophic type of invasion suggested by them. They,
G61 1200  3    in effect, have compromised the opposing positions
G61 1200 10    of the nineteenth century. On the other side are the
G61 1210  9    Celtic survivalists who have taken a tack divergent
G61 1220  6    from both these schools of nineteenth century thought.
G61 1230  2    As a group they should be favorable to a concept of
G61 1230 13    gradual Germanic infiltration although the specialist
G61 1240  6    nature of much of their work, e.g. Seebohm, Gray and
G61 1250  7    Finberg, tends to obscure their sympathies. Those who
G61 1260  5    do have occasion to deal with the invasions in a more
G61 1270  4    general way, like T.W. Shore and Arthur Wade-Evans,
G61 1280  1    are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful Germanic
G61 1280 12    penetration into Britain. Wade-Evans, in fact, denies
G61 1290  8    that there were any Anglo-Saxon invasions at all other
G61 1300  5    than a minor Jutish foray in A.D. 514.
G61 1310  2       Now omitting for a moment some recent developments
G61 1320  1    we can say the Saxon Shore hypothesis of Lappenberg
G61 1320 10    and Kemble has undergone virtual eclipse in this century.
G61 1330  7    It is no longer possible to say that a sceptical attitude
G61 1340  7    towards the received accounts of the invasions almost
G61 1350  3    automatically produces a "shore occupied by" interpretation.
G61 1360  1    Everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no
G61 1360 10    one has been willing to accept Lappenberg or Kemble's
G61 1370  8    position on that point. One reason is, of course, that
G61 1380  8    the new scepticism has been willing to maintain the
G61 1390  4    general picture of the invasions as portrayed in the
G61 1400  2    traditional sources. The few scholars who have adopted
G61 1400 10    the "shore occupied by" interpretation, Howorth, Shore,
G61 1410  6    and Wade-Evans, have all been Celtic survivalists.
G61 1420  6    Moreover, they have done so in rather special circumstances.
G61 1430  3       The primary reason for the abandonment of the "shore
G61 1440  4    occupied by" thesis has been the assimilation and accumulation
G61 1450  2    of archaeological evidence, the most striking feature
G61 1451  1    of early English studies in this century. Again omitting
G61 1451 10    recent developments, E.T. Leeds' dictum of 1913 has
G61 1460  6    stood unchallenged: "So far as archaeology is concerned,
G61 1470  5    there is not the least warrant for the second (shore
G61 1480  3    occupied by) of these theories". Even earlier Haverfield
G61 1490  1    had come to the same conclusion. What they meant was
G61 1490 11    that there was no evidence to show that the south and
G61 1500 10    east coasts of Britain received Germanic settlers conspicuously
G61 1510  4    earlier than some other parts of England. That is,
G61 1520  4    there was no trace of Anglo-Saxons in Britain as early
G61 1530  3    as the late third century, to which time the archaeological
G61 1540  1    evidence for the erection of the Saxon Shore forts
G61 1540 10    was beginning to point. In the face of a clear judgment
G61 1550  9    from archaeology, therefore, it became impossible for
G61 1560  4    a time for scholars to re-adopt the "shore settled
G61 1570  1    by" theory.
G61 1570  3       In recent years, however, a wind of change seems
G61 1580  2    to be blowing through early English historical circles.
G61 1580 10    The great increase in the amount of archaeological
G61 1590  8    activity, and therefore information, in the years immediately
G61 1600  6    preceeding and following the Second World War has brought
G61 1610  5    to light data which has changed the complection of
G61 1620  2    the Saxon Shore dispute. Where there were none fifteen
G61 1620 11    years ago, several scholars currently are edging their
G61 1630  8    way cautiously towards the acceptance of the "shore
G61 1640  6    occupied by" position. We must, therefore, have a look
G61 1650  5    at the new archaeological material and re-examine the
G61 1660  2    literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the
G61 1660 11    problem.
G61 1670  1    #@#
G61 1670  2    What exactly are we trying to prove? We know that the
G61 1680  1    Saxon Shore was a phenonenon of late Roman defensive
G61 1680 10    policy; in other words its existence belongs to the
G61 1690  8    period of Roman Britain. So whenever the Romans finally
G61 1700  5    withdrew from the island, the Saxon Shore disappeared
G61 1710  2    in the first decade of the fifth century. We also know
G61 1720  1    that the Saxon Shore as reflected in the Notitia was
G61 1720 11    created as a part of the Theodosian reorganization
G61 1730  8    of Britain (post-A.D. 369). My argument is that there
G61 1740  7    was no Saxon Shore prior to that time even though the
G61 1750  5    forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius.
G61 1760  1    Therefore, what we must prove or disprove is that there
G61 1760 11    were Saxons, in the broad sense in which we must construe
G61 1770 11    the word, in the area of the Saxon Shore at the time
G61 1780 10    it was called the Saxon Shore. That is, we must find
G61 1790  6    Saxons in East Anglia, Kent, Sussex and Hampshire in
G61 1800  3    the last half of the fourth century.
G61 1800 10       The problem, in other words, is strictly a chronological
G61 1810  8    one. In Gaul the Saxon element on its Saxon Shore was
G61 1820  7    plainly visible because there the Saxons were an intrusive
G61 1830  5    element in the population. In Britain, obviously, the
G61 1840  2    archaeological and place-name characteristics of the
G61 1840  9    Saxon Shore region are bound to be Saxon. It is a matter
G61 1850 12    of trying to sort out an earlier fourth-century Saxon
G61 1860  8    element from the later, fifth-century mainstream of
G61 1870  3    Anglo-Saxon invasions. This, naturally, will be difficult
G61 1880  3    to do since both the archaeological and place-name
G61 1880 12    evidence in this period, with some fortunate exceptions,
G61 1890  8    is insufficient for precise chronological purposes.
G61 1900  5       It might be well to consider the literary evidence
G61 1910  4    first because it can provide us with an answer to one
G61 1920  3    important question; namely, is the idea that there
G61 1920 11    were Saxon mercenaries in England at all reasonable?
