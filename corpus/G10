G10 0010  1       THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement
G10 0010 10    on sovereignty, through all their dispute about it,
G10 0020  7    than were the Founding Fathers. The truth in their
G10 0030  5    conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of
G10 0040  2    the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in
G10 0040 11    the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee.
G10 0050 10    The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion
G10 0060  6    to basic democratic principles, in understanding of
G10 0070  3    and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their
G10 0080  1    Union. Repeated efforts- beginning with the Missouri
G10 0080  8    Compromise of 1821- were made by such master moderates
G10 0090  9    as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully
G10 0100  6    by compromise, rather than clear thought and timely
G10 0110  4    action. Even so, confusion in this period gained such
G10 0120  2    strength (from compromise and other factors) that it
G10 0120 10    led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century.
G10 0130  7    Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the
G10 0140  6    danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively
G10 0150  3    slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.
G10 0160  1       The present issue in Atlantica- whether to transform
G10 0160  9    an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union
G10 0170  9    of sovereign citizens- resembles the American one of
G10 0180  8    1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil
G10 0190  5    War. And so I would only touch upon it now (much as
G10 0200  3    I have long wanted to write a book about it). I think
G10 0200 15    it is essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference
G10 0210  8    between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to
G10 0220  6    war in 1861- if only to see better how imperative is
G10 0230  4    our need today to clarify completely our far worse
G10 0240  1    confusion on this subject.
G10 0240  5       The difference came down to this: The Southern States
G10 0250  4    insisted that the United States was, in last analysis,
G10 0260  2    what its name implied- a Union of States. To their
G10 0260 12    leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the
G10 0270  9    people of sovereign states, who therefore retained
G10 0280  5    the right to secede from it. This right of the State,
G10 0290  4    its upholders contended, was essential to maintain
G10 0300  1    the federal balance and protect the liberty of the
G10 0300 10    people from the danger of centralizing power in the
G10 0310  6    Union government. The champions of the Union maintained
G10 0320  4    that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, the
G10 0330  2    united people of America, that it was a compact among
G10 0330 12    sovereign citizens rather than states, and that therefore
G10 0340  8    the states had no right to secede, though the citizens
G10 0350  6    could. Writing to Speed on August 24, 1855, Lincoln
G10 0360  4    made the latter point clear. In homely terms whose
G10 0370  1    timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his
G10 0370  9    own right to secede. "
G10 0380  1       We began by declaring that all men are created equal.
G10 0390  1    We now practically read it, all men are created equal
G10 0390 11    except negroes. When the Know-nothings get control,
G10 0400  7    it will read, All men are created equal except negroes
G10 0410  6    and foreigners and Catholics. When it comes to this,
G10 0420  5    I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they
G10 0430  2    make no pretence of loving liberty- to Russia, for
G10 0430 11    instance, where despotism can be taken pure, without
G10 0440  7    the base alloy of hypocrisy". [His emphasis]
G10 0450  3       When the Southern States exercised their "right
G10 0460  3    to secede", they formed what they officially styled
G10 0460 11    "The Confederate States of America". Dictionaries,
G10 0470  6    as we have seen, still cite this government, along
G10 0480  7    with the Articles of Confederation of 1781, as an example
G10 0490  6    of a confederacy. The fact is that the Southern Confederacy
G10 0500  3    differed from the earlier one almost as much as the
G10 0510  2    Federal Constitution did. The Confederate Constitution
G10 0510  8    copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and
G10 0520  8    most of the rest in substance. It operated on, by and
G10 0530  7    for the people individually just as did the Federal
G10 0540  4    Constitution. It made substantially the same division
G10 0550  1    of power between the central and state governments,
G10 0550  9    and among the executive, legislative and judicial branches.
G10 0560  6    #THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONFEDERACY AND FEDERAL UNION
G10 0570  5    IN 1861#
G10 0570  7    Many believe- and understandably- that the great difference
G10 0580  7    between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy
G10 0590  4    and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized
G10 0600  3    the right of each state to secede. But though each
G10 0610  1    of its members had asserted this right against the
G10 0610 10    Union, the final Constitution which the Confederacy
G10 0620  5    signed on March 11- nearly a month before hostilities
G10 0630  3    began- included no explicit provision authorizing a
G10 0640  2    state to secede. Its drafters discussed this vital
G10 0640 10    point but left it out of their Constitution. Their
G10 0650  8    President, Jefferson Davis, interpreted their Constitution
G10 0660  4    to mean that it "admits of no coerced association",
G10 0670  2    but this reremained so doubtful that "there were frequent
G10 0680  2    demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution".
G10 0690  1       The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation"
G10 0700  1    differed from that of the Federal Union only in two
G10 0700 11    important respects: It openly, defiantly, recognized
G10 0710  5    slavery- an institution which the Southerners of 1787,
G10 0720  6    even though they continued it, found so impossible
G10 0730  2    to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided
G10 0730 10    mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution. They
G10 0740  8    recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely
G10 0750  9    an economic interest, and that to recognize it explicitly
G10 0760  5    in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction
G10 0770  2    to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in
G10 0780  1    the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal,
G10 0780 11    that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
G10 0790  8    unalienable rights, that among them are life, liberty
G10 0800  5    and the pursuit of happiness ...". The other important
G10 0810  3    difference between the two Constitutions was that the
G10 0820  1    President of the Confederacy held office for six (instead
G10 0820 10    of four) years, and was limited to one term.
G10 0830  8       These are not, however, differences in federal structure.
G10 0840  4    The only important differences from that standpoint,
G10 0850  2    between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles.
G10 0860  1    The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government
G10 0860 12    the people were acting through their states, whereas
G10 0870  7    the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed, as clearly as language
G10 0880  6    can, the opposite concept, that they were acting directly
G10 0890  4    as citizens. Here are the two Preambles:
G10 0900  1    _FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, 1789_
G10 0900  3       "we the People of the United States, in order to
G10 0910  4    form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure
G10 0920  1    domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence,
G10 0920  8    promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings
G10 0930  6    of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain
G10 0940  5    and establish this Constitution for the United States
G10 0950  2    of America".
G10 0950  4    _CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION, 1861_
G10 0960  1       "We the people of the Confederate States, each state
G10 0960  9    acting in its sovereign and independent character,
G10 0970  5    in order to form a permanent federal government, establish
G10 0980  3    justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure the
G10 0990  2    blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity-
G10 0990 10    invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God-
G10 1000  9    do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate
G10 1010  6    States of America".
G10 1020  1       One is tempted to say that, on the difference between
G10 1020 11    the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles,
G10 1030  7    the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought.
G10 1040  4    But though the Southern States, when drafting a constitution
G10 1050  3    to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this
G10 1060  1    fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede,
G10 1060 11    the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they
G10 1070  8    had already acted on the concept that it was composed
G10 1080  5    primarily of sovereign states. If the Union conceded
G10 1090  2    this to them, the same right must be conceded to each
G10 1090 13    remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede: This
G10 1100  9    would destroy the federal balance between it and the
G10 1110  6    states, and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty
G10 1120  3    of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained
G10 1130  1    by their Union.
G10 1130  4       Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue
G10 1140  2    for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of
G10 1140 14    sovereign citizens that should continue to live, or
G10 1150  8    an association of sovereign states that must fall prey
G10 1160  6    either to "anarchy or despotism".
G10 1170  1       Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always
G10 1170  9    willing to concede to each "slave state" the right
G10 1180  8    to decide independently whether to continue or end
G10 1190  5    it. Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners
G10 1200  3    as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal
G10 1210  1    balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed
G10 1210 10    no such change in the rights the Constitution gave
G10 1220  7    the states. After the war began, he long refused to
G10 1230  5    permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even
G10 1240  2    in the Border States that stayed with the Union. He
G10 1240 12    issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt
G10 1250  8    that necessity left him no other way to save the Union.
G10 1260  9    In his Message of December 2, 1862, he put his purpose
G10 1270  7    and his policy in these words- which I would call the
G10 1280  4    Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: "In giving freedom
G10 1290  2    to the slave, we assure freedom to the free".
G10 1290 11       What Lincoln could not concede was that the states
G10 1300  9    rather than the people were sovereign in the Union.
G10 1310  6    He fought to the end to preserve it as a "government
G10 1320  4    of the people, by the people, for the people".
G10 1330  1    #THE TRUTH ON EACH SIDE WON IN THE CIVIL WAR#
G10 1330 10    The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty
G10 1340  5    of their states did this in order to keep many of their
G10 1350  5    people more securely in slavery- the antithesis of
G10 1360  2    individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer, and
G10 1360  9    the greater. Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged,
G10 1370  8    in the South as in the North, as America's true sovereign,
G10 1380  5    in "a new birth of freedom", as Lincoln promised. But
G10 1390  4    before this came about, 214,938 Americans had given
G10 1400  2    their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign
G10 1400 13    rights of men and of states.
G10 1410  6       On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish
G10 1420  4    between them when he paid tribute to the "brave men,
G10 1430  2    living and dead, who fought here". He understood that
G10 1430 11    both sides were at fault, and he reached the height
G10 1440 10    of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural.
G10 1450  5       To my knowledge, Lincoln remains the only Head of
G10 1460  5    State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting a
G10 1470  2    fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough
G10 1470 12    to say this publicly- to give his foe the benefit of
G10 1480  8    the fact that in all human truth there is some error,
G10 1490  6    and in all our error, some truth. So great a man could
G10 1500  4    not but understand, too, that the thing that moves
G10 1500 13    men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their
G10 1510 10    thought, which their opponents see and attack, but
G10 1520  6    the truth which the latter do not see- any more than
G10 1530  6    they see the error which mars the truth they themselves
G10 1540  1    defend.
G10 1540  2       It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's
G10 1540 11    day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had
G10 1550 10    given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the
G10 1560  8    balance between the powers they had delegated to the
G10 1570  4    States and to their Union. They differed in the balance
G10 1580  2    they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen-
G10 1590  1    but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain
G10 1590 10    a still more fundamental truth: That individual life,
G10 1600  5    liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between
G10 1610  6    the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty, in all
G10 1620  3    its aspects, which this involves. The 140,414 Americans
G10 1630  1    who gave "the last full measure of devotion" to prevent
G10 1630 11    disunion, preserved individual freedom in the United
G10 1640  7    States from the dangers of anarchy, inherent in confederations,
G10 1650  6    which throughout history have proved fatal in the end
G10 1660  6    to all associations composed primarily of sovereign
G10 1670  1    states, and to the liberties of their people. But the
G10 1670 11    fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure
G10 1680  8    of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union
G10 1690  6    in other essential ways.
G10 1700  1       Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter
G10 1700 10    ended by costing the Southerners their right to have
G10 1710  7    slaves- a right that was even less compatible with
G10 1720  4    the sovereignty of man. The very fact that they came
G10 1730  2    so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly
G10 1730 13    to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they
G10 1740 10    fought for, since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves
G10 1750  6    as a military measure. There was a divine justice in
G10 1760  5    one wrong thus undoing another. There was also a lesson,
G10 1770  2    one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in
G10 1770 12    their conflicts with one another, from turning from
G10 1780  7    the ballot to the bullet. Yet though the Southern States
G10 1790  6    lost the worst errors in their case, they did not lose
G10 1800  5    the truth they fought for. The lives so many of them
G10 1810  1    gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal
G10 1810 11    encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to
G10 1820  9    their states have continued ever since to safeguard
G10 1830  5    all Americans against freedom's other foe.
