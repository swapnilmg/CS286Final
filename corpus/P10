P10 0010  1       Among us, we three handled quite a few small commissions,
P10 0010 11    from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown
P10 0020  7    to magazine work and quick lettering jobs. Each of
P10 0030  5    us had his own specialty besides. George did wonderful
P10 0040  3    complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out
P10 0040 11    of a medieval miniature: hundreds of delicate details
P10 0050  6    crammed into an eight-by-ten sheet and looking as if
P10 0060  6    they had been done under a jeweler's glass. He also
P10 0070  4    drew precise crisp spots, which he sold to various
P10 0070 13    literary and artistic journals, The New Yorker, for
P10 0080  8    instance, or Esquire. I did book jackets and covers
P10 0090  8    for paperback reprints: naked girls huddling in corners
P10 0100  6    of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway, daring
P10 0110  3    the cops to take him, is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching
P10 0120  1    a revolver. The book could be The Brothers Karamazov,
P10 0120 10    but it would still have the same jacket illustration.
P10 0130  9    I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press; the
P10 0140  8    book was a fine historical novel about Edward III,
P10 0150  4    and I did a week of research to get the details just
P10 0160  2    right: the fifteenth-century armor, furnishings, clothes.
P10 0160  9    I even ferreted out the materials from which shields
P10 0170  9    were made- linden wood covered with leather- so I'd
P10 0180  7    get the light reflections accurate. McKenzie, the art
P10 0190  4    editor, took one look at my finished sketch and said,
P10 0200  3    "Nothing doing, Rufus. In the first place, it's static;
P10 0210  1    in the second place, it doesn't look authentic; and
P10 0210 10    in the third place, it would cost a fortune to reproduce
P10 0220  9    in the first place- you've got six colors there including
P10 0230  7    gold". I said, "Mr. McKenzie, it is as authentic as
P10 0240  6    careful research can make it". He said, "That may be,
P10 0250  5    but it isn't authentic the way readers think. They
P10 0260  2    know from their researches into television and the
P10 0260 10    movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful
P10 0270  8    flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy, and only
P10 0280  5    the villains had beards. And girls couldn't have dressed
P10 0290  3    like that- it isn't transparent enough". In the end,
P10 0300  4    I did the same old picture, the naked girl and the
P10 0300 15    guy in the doorway, only I put a Lord Byron shirt on
P10 0310 11    the guy, gave him a sword instead of a pistol, and
P10 0320  7    painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie.
P10 0330  4    McKenzie was as happy as a clam. "That's authenticity",
P10 0340  2    he said.
P10 0340  4       As for Donald, he actually sold paintings. We all
P10 0350  3    painted in our spare time, and we had all started as
P10 0360  1    easel painters with scholarships, but he was the only
P10 0360 10    one of us who made any regular money at it. Not much;
P10 0370  8    he sold perhaps three or four a year, and usually all
P10 0380  6    to Joyce Monmouth or her friends. He had style, a real
P10 0390  3    inner vision of his very own. It was strange stuff-
P10 0390 13    it reminded me of the pictures of a child, but a child
P10 0400 12    who has never played with other kids and has lived
P10 0410  7    all its life with adults. There was the freshness of
P10 0420  4    color, the freedom of perception, the lack of self-consciousness,
P10 0430  1    but with a twist that made the forms leap from the
P10 0430 12    page and smack you in the eye. We used to kid him by
P10 0440 12    saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted.
P10 0450  8    It may have been true for all I know, because his glasses
P10 0460  6    were like the bottoms of milk bottles, but it didn't
P10 0470  4    prevent the paintings from being exciting. He also
P10 0470 12    had, at times, an uncanny absent-minded air like a
P10 0480 10    sleepwalker; he would look right through you while
P10 0490  6    you were talking to him, and if you said, "For Christ's
P10 0500  3    sake, Donald, you've got Prussian blue all over your
P10 0510  3    shirt", he would smile, and nod, and an hour later
P10 0510 13    the paint would be all over his pants as well. Mrs.
P10 0520 10    Monmouth thought of him as her discovery, and she paid
P10 0530  8    two to three hundred dollars for a painting. It was
P10 0540  4    all gravy, and Donald didn't need much to live on;
P10 0550  1    none of us did. We shared the expenses of the studio,
P10 0550 12    and we all lived within walking distance of it, in
P10 0560  8    cheap lodgings of one kind or another.
P10 0570  2       Attending the life class was my idea- or rather,
P10 0570 11    Askington's idea, but I was ripe for it, and the other
P10 0580 11    two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into
P10 0590  9    it. I wanted to paint again. I hadn't done a serious
P10 0600  6    picture in almost a year. It wasn't just the pressure
P10 0610  4    of work, although that was the excuse I often used,
P10 0620  1    even to myself. It was the kind of work I was doing,
P10 0620 13    the quality of the ambition it awoke in me, that kept
P10 0630  9    me from painting. I kept saying, "If I could just build
P10 0640  6    up a reputation for myself, make some real money, get
P10 0650  3    to be well known as an illustrator- like Peter Askington,
P10 0660  1    for instance- then I could take some time off and paint".
P10 0670  1    Askington was a kind of goal I set myself; I had admired
P10 0670 13    him long before I talked to him. It looked to me as
P10 0680 12    though he had everything an artist could want, joy
P10 0690  6    in his work, standing in the profession, a large and
P10 0700  4    steady income. The night we first met, at one of Mrs.
P10 0710  1    Monmouth's giant parties, he was wearing a brown cashmere
P10 0710 10    jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella
P10 0720  9    shirt; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo
P10 0730  6    drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump
P10 0740  3    of pale pure jade. This set his tone: richness of texture
P10 0750  1    and color, and another kind of richness as well, for
P10 0750 11    his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off's
P10 0760  8    rent for a year. He was fifteen years older than I-
P10 0770  6    forty-four- but full of spring and sparkle. He didn't
P10 0780  4    look like what I thought of as an old man, and his
P10 0790  2    lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger.
P10 0790 11    He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators
P10 0800  7    in America; you saw one of his paintings on the cover
P10 0810  7    of one or another of the slick national magazines every
P10 0820  3    month. Life had included him in its "Modern American
P10 0830  1    Artists" series and had photographed him at his studio
P10 0830 10    in the East Sixties; the corner of it you could see
P10 0840 11    in the photograph looked as though it ought to have
P10 0850  8    Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain.
P10 0860  3       I had a long talk with him. We went into Mrs. Monmouth's
P10 0870  2    library, which had low bookshelves all along the walls,
P10 0880  1    and above them a Modigliani portrait, a Jackson Pollock
P10 0880 10    twelve feet long, and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow
P10 0890  9    background, that looked like an inscription from a
P10 0900  5    Martian tomb. The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs.
P10 0910  3    Monmouth by Picasso himself. Like certain expensive
P10 0910 10    restaurants, just sitting there gave you the illusion
P10 0920  8    of being wealthy yourself.
P10 0930  1       In the course of our talk, Askington mentioned that
P10 0930 10    he spent part of each week studying. "By yourself"?
P10 0940  9    I asked. "No, I take classes with different people",
P10 0950  7    he said. "I don't think I've reached the point, yet,
P10 0960  7    where I can say I know everything I ought to know about
P10 0970  6    the craft. Besides, it's important to the way a painter
P10 0980  4    thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere,
P10 0980 13    an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other
P10 0990 11    masters, as Du^rer went to Italy to meet Bellini and
P10 1000  8    Mantegna".
P10 1000  9       He made a circle with his thumb and fingers. "Painting
P10 1010  9    isn't this big, you know. It doesn't embrace only the
P10 1020  8    artist, alone before his easel. It is as large as all
P10 1030  7    of art, interdependent, varied, multitudinous". He
P10 1040  2    threw his arms wide, his face shining. "The artist
P10 1040 11    is like a fragment of a mosaic- no, he is more than
P10 1050 11    that, a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic.
P10 1060  5    One of these days, I'm going to organize a gigantic
P10 1070  3    exhibition that will span everything that's being painted
P10 1080  2    these days, from extreme abstract expressionism to
P10 1080  9    extreme photorealism, and then you'll be able to see
P10 1090  8    at a glance how much artists have in common with each
P10 1100  6    other. The eye is all, inward or outward. Ah, what
P10 1110  3    a title for the exhibition: The Eye is All"!
P10 1120  1       "What do you study"? I asked. I was fascinated;
P10 1120 10    just listening to him made me feel intelligent.
P10 1130  7       "I'm studying anatomy with Burns", he replied. "Maybe
P10 1140  6    you know him. He teaches at the Manhattan School of
P10 1150  5    Art". I nodded. I had studied with Burns ten years
P10 1160  3    before, during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave
P10 1160 11    me, along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my
P10 1170 10    paintings of bums on Hudson Street. Burns and I had
P10 1180  7    not loved each other. "I'm also studying enameling
P10 1190  3    with Hajime Iijima", he went on, "and twice a week
P10 1200  3    I go to a life class taught by Pendleton".
P10 1200 12       "Osric Pendleton"? I said. "My God, is he still
P10 1210  9    alive? He must be a million years old. I went to a
P10 1220 10    retrospective of his work when I was eighteen, and
P10 1230  5    I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's".
P10 1240  1       "Not quite". Askington laughed. "He's about sixty,
P10 1250  1    now. Still painting, still a kind of modern impressionist,
P10 1250 10    beautiful canvases of mountains and farms. He even
P10 1260  8    makes the city look like one of Thoreau's hangouts.
P10 1270  5    I've always admired him, and when I heard he was taking
P10 1280  5    a few pupils, I went to him and joined his class".
P10 1290  1       "Yes, it sounds great", I said, "but suppose you
P10 1300  1    don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter"?
P10 1300  9       "You're missing the point", he said. "He has the
P10 1310  9    magical eye. And he is a great man. Contact with him
P10 1320  9    is stimulating. And that's the trouble with so many
P10 1330  6    artists today. They lack stimulation. They sit alone
P10 1340  2    in their rooms and try to paint, and only succeed in
P10 1340 13    isolating themselves still farther from life. That's
P10 1350  7    one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation.
P10 1360  6    In the Middle Ages, in the Renaissance, right up to
P10 1370  4    the early nineteenth century, the painter was a giant
P10 1380  1    in the world. He was an artisan, a man who studied
P10 1380 12    his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a
P10 1390  7    goldsmith or a wood carver did. He filled a real need,
P10 1400  6    showing society what it looked like, turning it inside
P10 1410  3    out, portraying its wars and its leaders, its ugliness
P10 1410 12    and its beauties, reflecting its profound religious
P10 1420  6    impulses. He was a propagandist- they weren't afraid
P10 1430  6    of the word, then- satirist, nature lover, philosopher,
P10 1440  3    scientist, what you will, a member of every party and
P10 1450  2    of no party. But look at us today! We hold safe little
P10 1450 14    jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious
P10 1460  8    incidents in trivial novels, and most of our easel
P10 1470  6    painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the
P10 1480  3    navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity.
P10 1480 12    A bunch of amateur dervishes! What we need is to get
P10 1490 10    back to the group, to learning and apprenticeship,
P10 1500  4    to the cafe and the school".
P10 1500 10       He could certainly talk. The upshot of the evening
P10 1510  9    was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio- or
P10 1520  6    rather, of the studio in which he gave his classes,
P10 1530  5    for he didn't work there himself- and joined the life
P10 1540  3    class, which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten
P10 1540 12    to twelve in the morning. It was an awkward hour, but
P10 1550 10    I didn't have to punch any time clock, and it only
P10 1560  8    meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours
P10 1580  4    later at the drawing board to finish up a job. After
P10 1590  1    a short time, both George and Donald joined the class
P10 1590 11    with me so they wouldn't feel lonely, and we used to
P10 1610  8    hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading OUT
P10 1620  5    TO WORK. It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman,
P10 1630  3    because hardly anybody else ever visited us.
P10 1630 10       In a way, Askington was right. "Stimulating" was
P10 1640  8    the word for it. I don't know that it was always as
P10 1650  9    rewarding as I had expected it to be. Partly, it was
P10 1660  6    because Pendleton himself wasn't what I anticipated.
P10 1670  1    I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this
P10 1670 12    classic, and he turned out to be a rather bitter old
P10 1680 11    man who smelled of dead cigars.
P10 1690  1       No, that isn't quite fair. Actually, there was a
P10 1690 10    lot of force in him, which is why I kept on in that
P10 1700 13    class instead of quitting after a week.
