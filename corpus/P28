P28 0010  1       Martin felt it was incredible that the situation
P28 0010  9    had come to exist at all. And once begun, had grown
P28 0020  8    to such monstrous proportions. The pair of white cotton
P28 0030  6    shorts ruled his life.
P28 0030 10       Lying awake at night, he could see them, laid out
P28 0040  9    on the floor of his mind. When he rose in the morning,
P28 0050  6    the image was still there.
P28 0050 11       He had always been a messy and negligent man. In
P28 0060  8    his bachelor days, his bedroom had been strewn with
P28 0070  5    clothes which his mother, or later the hotel maid,
P28 0080  1    generally saw fit to put in order. No doubt Dolores
P28 0080 11    resented following in their footsteps.
P28 0090  4       But it was fun those first days, kidding about the
P28 0100  3    trail of garments he left littered across the rug.
P28 0100 12    There was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal
P28 0110  9    to pick them up. Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop
P28 0120  7    to lift the things.
P28 0120 11       He remembered the first time he saw her, standing
P28 0130  9    across the room at a party. The smooth curve of her
P28 0140  6    neck, very white against hair which curled against
P28 0150  2    it like petals. Her hair was the color of those blooms
P28 0150 13    which in seed catalogues are referred to as "black",
P28 0160  9    but since no flower is actually without color contain
P28 0170  6    always a hint of grape or purple or blue- he wanted
P28 0180  5    to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers,
P28 0190  1    searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might
P28 0190 11    reveal its true shade beneath the darkness.
P28 0200  6       So he sought her out, and spoke to her, and thought
P28 0210  5    of his hand in her hair. Or against her back, pressed
P28 0220  2    on the column of vertebrae, which held her so magnificently
P28 0230  1    straight and unyielding, until the segments of bone
P28 0230  9    made tiny sharp cracking noises, like the snapped stem
P28 0240  6    of a tulip.
P28 0240  9       But, to put it bluntly, nothing snapped. Yet that
P28 0250  6    had not seriously troubled him, not then. They married.
P28 0260  5    More he could take at leisure. All Martin thought he
P28 0270  3    needed was time: to what better use could time be put?
P28 0280  1       He saw later that they had made their marriage too
P28 0280 11    quickly. There was too little occasion beforehand for
P28 0290  7    resistance, the brave strong delights of emotional
P28 0300  4    clash and meeting. They had left themselves too much
P28 0310  3    to discover.
P28 0310  5       But, at the start, his new life felt invigorating.
P28 0320  1    Good.
P28 0320  2       It was on the tenth day after the wedding (how could
P28 0330  2    it have been so soon?) that he dropped the shorts on
P28 0330 13    the floor.
P28 0340  1       "Now, I'm not going to pick up those shorts"!
P28 0350  1       Martin gave her a teasing pat. "I think you'll get
P28 0350 11    tired of them there".
P28 0360  3       In the morning the shorts were where he had left
P28 0370  1    them. He smiled to himself, and decided not to mention
P28 0370 11    them till Dolores did. It was almost too easy. For
P28 0380  9    he had just remembered: tonight they were having their
P28 0390  6    first guests. The shorts would not be on the floor
P28 0400  4    when he came home that evening.
P28 0400 10       He was wrong. The rest of the bedroom had been groomed
P28 0410  8    to a superhuman neatness, but in the middle of the
P28 0420  5    carpet lay the disheveled shorts. They gave the room
P28 0430  1    a strange note of incongruity, like a mole on a beautiful
P28 0430 12    face.
P28 0440  1       He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last
P28 0440 11    minute, thinking he would get nervous. Quietly he determined
P28 0450  8    to foil her. I can be as stubborn as she can, he thought;
P28 0460  9    my nerves are as strong. She'll rush to the bedroom
P28 0470  5    when the doorbell rings.
P28 0470  9       It rang. Ten minutes early.
P28 0480  3       Martin was standing a few feet from the front door.
P28 0490  2    He swung around, eyes toward the bedroom, some fifteen
P28 0490 11    feet away. Dolores stood motionless in the doorway.
P28 0500  8       He could not cross the living room, brush past her,
P28 0510  7    and bend down to retrieve the shorts.
P28 0520  1       Martin turned his back. He strode to answer the
P28 0520 10    bell.
P28 0530  1       Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet. With
P28 0530 10    the most casual and relaxed manner in the world, Dolores
P28 0540  8    led Anthea to the bedroom. Martin strained his ears.
P28 0550  5       At first he could not be sure. Then he caught just
P28 0560  5    enough to know that the shorts were still there. A
P28 0570  2    glissade of giggles slid over their voices.
P28 0570  9       All evening Anthea favored him with odd, coy looks.
P28 0580  7    Clearly she had been instructed "not to say a word".
P28 0590  6    For some reason, this ellipsis in the conversation
P28 0600  1    spread until it swallowed up every other topic. At
P28 0600 10    last there was a void no one could fill. The Brainards
P28 0610 10    went home early.
P28 0620  1       Martin realized, later on, that he should have "had
P28 0620 10    it out" with Dolores that night. As violently as possible.
P28 0630  8    But he was so taken aback, he could not believe any
P28 0640  7    rage of his would make her give in. On the contrary,
P28 0650  4    it would only weaken his position if he fumed, while
P28 0660  1    she stayed calm and adamant. And if he surrendered
P28 0660 10    after raving at her. ... He shivered.
P28 0670  6       Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether? At
P28 0680  2    once. He considered the sober possibility.
P28 0680  8       In his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea.
P28 0690 11       There was something about private feminine whisperings
P28 0700  6    which always made him feel scabrous and unclean. He
P28 0710  5    remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood
P28 0715  2    women friends, lowering her voice to a penetrating
P28 0720  7    hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head
P28 0730 10    of the stairs, where he crouched listening. He could
P28 0740  5    even recall the last time he sat there. She was talking
P28 0750  4    about him that time, because he had done some bad thing,
P28 0760  1    something she disliked, but "Afterwards Martin said
P28 0760  8    he was sorry. He apologized so sweetly, I couldn't
P28 0770  7    keep being annoyed with him". It wasn't even true that
P28 0780  7    he'd said he was sorry that time; he had in fact said
P28 0790  6    simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened, which
P28 0800  2    was as honest as he could put it. But his mother told
P28 0800 14    the story over and over, till her "Martin said he was
P28 0810 11    sorry" was as much a part of her as the shape of her
P28 0820 11    thin, pallid ears.
P28 0820 14       The battle had to be fought. Let the best sex win.
P28 0830 11       But his resolution hardly seemed to help. If the
P28 0840  7    situation had been bad, it now got worse. About this
P28 0850  4    time people began "dropping in", considering that the
P28 0860  3    newly married had been left alone long enough. Angrily
P28 0860 12    Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone
P28 0870  9    on a trip- preferably one that lasted months- instead
P28 0880  6    of deciding not to postpone the date until he could
P28 0890  4    get away. Here they were at the mercy of anyone who
P28 0900  1    chose to come by. These stray people nearly always
P28 0900 10    insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment.
P28 0910  6    Of course, the tours of inspection included the ever-present
P28 0920  5    shorts.
P28 0920  6       It was curious how the different visitors took this.
P28 0930  5    Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance.
P28 0940  2    Others asked. Quite a few laughed. To them all Dolores
P28 0950  3    told a lighthearted and witty tale.
P28 0950  9       "It's a little contest Martin and I have", she would
P28 0960  8    begin gaily, carrying the anecdote through a frothy
P28 0970  6    and deceptive course. While he waited in the living
P28 0980  4    room.
P28 0980  5       Once Martin went along. They entered the bedroom,
P28 0990  2    and Dolores said nothing. Then one of the guests showed
P28 0990 12    his merriment. "You were in a hurry, weren't you"?
P28 1000  9    Martin would have liked to break the man's neck. Dolores
P28 1010  9    smiled; she let the interpretation stand. Now Martin
P28 1020  5    heard himself give a snort of mock good nature. With
P28 1030  4    her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth, ready to
P28 1040  1    begin: It's a little contest-
P28 1040  6       Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing
P28 1050  7    the apartment.
P28 1050  9       They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations.
P28 1060  6    But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything.
P28 1070  5    What to talk about?
P28 1070  9       Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes (except
P28 1080  8    the fatal shorts) which he left about, but he had been
P28 1090  6    robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions. He
P28 1100  2    fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers
P28 1100 12    and closets, so his life might impinge as little as
P28 1110  9    possible on hers. The shorts alone remained.
P28 1120  4       In his moments of worst agony, Martin imagined what
P28 1130  3    his friends were saying. The sound of their amazement.
P28 1140  1    Bizarre: He could hear the word. The most bizarre situation.
P28 1150  1    We were up to visit them and ...
P28 1150  9       He had thought her exactly what he wanted. Six weeks
P28 1160  6    of marriage and I'm using the past tense, he told himself
P28 1170  4    furiously. Pursuing his idea, he saw that it would
P28 1180  1    be impossible to leave her now. Everyone would know
P28 1180 10    why; he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure.
P28 1190  6       He was trapped.
P28 1190  9       Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from
P28 1200 10    the dilemma he had made for himself. His mind scurried
P28 1210  6    frantically, seeking an exit. Alternately he had periods
P28 1220  4    of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly,
P28 1230  1    morosely, to live out his life in this fashion. Nothing
P28 1230 11    would change, nothing would ever change.
P28 1240  6       When the solution finally came to him, one night
P28 1250  6    while he was in bed, he was so shaken by its simplicity
P28 1260  1    that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to
P28 1260 12    him before.
P28 1270  1       In a frenzy of excitement, he considered his plan.
P28 1280  1       Beside his shorts, he would place something of hers.
P28 1280  9       Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable
P28 1290  7    moral victory, for if she picked up, say, a pair of
P28 1300  6    her panties, she might just as well lift his shorts
P28 1310  2    lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost
P28 1310 10    the same. He felt that it would be a particular humiliation
P28 1320 10    to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had
P28 1330  8    laid on the floor. Furthermore, he could go on repeating
P28 1340  6    the maneuver endlessly: every time he went in the bedroom,
P28 1350  4    he could drop a slip or a brassiere, or maybe a girdle,
P28 1360  1    next to his shorts. Sooner or later, Dolores would
P28 1360 10    crack. On the other hand, if she didn't remove her
P28 1370  8    own things, it would be difficult to explain to the
P28 1380  5    parade of guests which traversed the apartment.
P28 1390  1       Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager
P28 1390 10    to tell the next installment of her story. The tale,
P28 1400  8    he thought, would become less gay. She had used his
P28 1410  6    rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness,
P28 1420  1    his lack of control, his general male looseness, while
P28 1420 10    she remained cool, airy, and untouched, the charming
P28 1430  8    teacher who disciplined an unruly body. To have her
P28 1440  7    underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw
P28 1450  3    her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd.
P28 1460  1       Something in the back of his mind was aware that
P28 1460 11    the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith, that
P28 1470  9    the idea would work because he believed in it, since
P28 1480  4    his courage and virility were involved, because it
P28 1490  1    was truly his. The knowledge kept him from analyzing
P28 1490 10    his scheme to death, and took him through the last
P28 1500  7    hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism.
P28 1510  2       The next morning, while Dolores was out of the room,
P28 1520  3    he went to her bureau drawer, took out a pair of nylon
P28 1520 15    lace pants, and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts.
P28 1530 10    He sat down on the bed.
P28 1540  3       In a surprisingly short time, Dolores appeared.
P28 1540 10    To his delight, her eyes focused at once upon the two
P28 1550 11    garments. Slowly and deliberately she reached down
P28 1560  5    and touched the lace with her fingers, then hesitated
P28 1570  3    for about a second. Ah, he thought, she's going through
P28 1580  1    the chain of reasoning which says she might really
P28 1580 10    just as well pick up my shorts too. He saw that in
P28 1590 10    a moment she had grasped all the implications of a
P28 1600  4    plot which had been weeks in occurring to him. Extending
P28 1610  1    her fingers another inch, she caught up the shorts,
P28 1610 10    and swiftly left the room. She did not look at him,
P28 1620 10    but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes
P28 1630  6    unsteady.
P28 1630  7       They breakfasted together, but Martin did not refer
P28 1640  6    to his triumph, and Dolores found a great deal to do
P28 1650  4    in the kitchen, bobbing up and down from the table
P28 1650 14    so that talk was impossible. Well, Martin thought,
P28 1660  7    That'll save. He left for work in high spirits.
P28 1670  6       As he relaxed that day, Martin realized how tense
P28 1680  3    he had been these past weeks. He found that he no longer
P28 1690  1    hated Dolores (he knew how much he had hated her),
P28 1690 11    and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate
P28 1700  8    feeling.
