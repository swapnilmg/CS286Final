P07 0010  1       Spencer said nothing.
P07 0010  4       "Is there any word you would like to offer in your
P07 0020  5    own defense"?
P07 0020  7       Spencer shook his head.
P07 0030  1       Alexander said, "Answer me properly, Spencer".
P07 0040  1       Spencer was quiet for a moment longer, then he said,
P07 0040 10    "There is nothing I want to say, Captain".
P07 0050  6       "Very well". Alexander walked away. Naval procedure,
P07 0060  4    he thought, had its moments of grim humor. Philip Spencer
P07 0070  3    had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain,
P07 0080  1    yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of
P07 0080 13    proper address.
P07 0090  1       During the morning hours, it became clear that the
P07 0090 10    arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon
P07 0100  8    the men of the Somers. Those named in the Greek paper
P07 0110  7    were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence
P07 0120  4    of some call of duty, so as to be near Spencer, watching
P07 0130  1    an opportunity to communicate with him. Hostile glances
P07 0130  9    were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort. The
P07 0140  8    two met in the Captain's cabin.
P07 0150  2       "What is the next step, Captain"?
P07 0160  1       "More arrests, I fear".
P07 0160  5       In your opinion, who is this E. Andrews on the 'certain'
P07 0170  5    list"?
P07 0170  6       "Cromwell, of course. He is the oldest and most
P07 0180  7    experienced of the lot. He saw the dangers, not the
P07 0190  3    glories of being identified as a mutineer. Somehow
P07 0190 11    he talked Spencer into letting him use another name".
P07 0200  9       There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with
P07 0210 10    the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain.
P07 0220  5       "Have him come in".
P07 0220  9       Heiser, breathless and wild-eyed, brought the chilling
P07 0230  8    news that the handspikes, heavers and holystones had
P07 0240  5    been mysteriously removed from their customary places.
P07 0250  3       "And also, sir, two articles which were considered
P07 0260  1    souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely.
P07 0260 10    An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being
P07 0270 11    sharpened by McKinley and Green. McKinley was overheard
P07 0280  6    to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's
P07 0290  7    possession and that"-
P07 0300  1       "Where did you gather all this information, Heiser?
P07 0300  8    Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes
P07 0310  7    and heavers and who"-
P07 0320  1       He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and
P07 0320 11    sprang toward the ladder, with Gansevoort and Heiser
P07 0330  6    behind him. A glance revealed that the main topgallant
P07 0340  5    mast had been carried away. The aimless milling about
P07 0350  2    of what had been a well-trained, well-organized crew
P07 0350 12    struck Alexander with horror. He bellowed orders and
P07 0360  8    watched the alert response of some of his men and watched,
P07 0370  8    too, the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly
P07 0380  4    toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction.
P07 0390  3       Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander's side. "Small
P07 0400  3    violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full
P07 0410  1    intention to carry away the mast. I saw him myself
P07 0410 11    and it was done after consultation with Cromwell. I
P07 0420  5    swear it, sir".
P07 0420  8       And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken, for
P07 0430  8    both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding
P07 0440  6    in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip
P07 0450  3    Spencer had given the signal to obey. Then, with disappointment
P07 0460  1    evident upon their faces, they moved to the work. Alexander
P07 0470  1    guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil,
P07 0470  9    thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle
P07 0480  8    and bloodshed. Their strategy was sound enough and,
P07 0490  5    he reasoned, had been defeated only by Philip Spencer's
P07 0500  2    unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated.
P07 0510  1       When the mast was raised, Alexander gave the order
P07 0510 10    for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest, and
P07 0520  9    now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck
P07 0530  6    and terror stalked the Somers.
P07 0540  1       Spencer's potential followers were openly sullen
P07 0540  7    and morose, missing muster without excuse, expressing
P07 0550  5    in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners
P07 0560  4    being kept in irons, communicating with the three by
P07 0570  2    glance and signal. One of the missing handspikes came
P07 0570 11    out of its hiding place after Midshipman Tillotson
P07 0580  6    had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman Wilson. Tillotson
P07 0590  5    had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later,
P07 0600  5    with back turned, had been attacked by Wilson, brandishing
P07 0610  1    the weapon. Wilson, shackled and snarling, was thrown
P07 0610  9    with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green,
P07 0620  9    McKee and McKinley. Not a man on the brig, loyal or
P07 0630  9    villainous, could be unaffected by the sight of seven
P07 0640  5    men involved in the crime of mutiny.
P07 0640 12       In the tiny cabin, Alexander met with Gansevoort,
P07 0650  7    Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen. Three days
P07 0660  7    had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had
P07 0670  5    brought new dangers, new fears.
P07 0670 10       Gansevoort said, "It requires an omniscient eye
P07 0680  6    to select those if any on whom we can now rely. To
P07 0690  5    have the Greek paper is not the great help that at
P07 0700  1    first flush it seemed. From actions aboard, it is easy
P07 0700 11    to guess that Spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers
P07 0710  7    was a modest estimate".
P07 0720  1       "Well", Heiser ventured, "why don't we hold an investigation
P07 0730  1    with questioning and"-
P07 0730  4       "That would be worse than useless", Alexander broke
P07 0740  5    in. "There is not space to hold or force to guard any
P07 0750  6    increased number of prisoners. Besides, suppose we
P07 0760  2    hold a court of inquiry, then what? Then we have informed
P07 0760 13    a large number of our crew that when they reach the
P07 0770 10    United States, they will be punished but that in the
P07 0780  7    meanwhile, they may run loose and are expected to perform
P07 0790  4    their jobs in good order. Mr. Heiser, does this sound
P07 0800  2    like a truly workable plan to you? Do you not think
P07 0800 13    these men might choose the black flag here and now"?
P07 0810  9       Wales said, "Of course they would. They are about
P07 0830  7    to do so at any moment as it is. All that is needed
P07 0840  6    is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take
P07 0850  2    the lead. As soon as that one man is appointed by himself
P07 0850 14    or the others or by a signal from Spencer, we are going
P07 0860 11    to be rushed. We are going to be rushed and murdered".
P07 0870  8       "That is extravagant language, Mr. Wales. We are
P07 0880  6    not going to be rushed and murdered", Alexander said.
P07 0890  3    "We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor
P07 0900  3    safe and sound".
P07 0900  6       "Of course, I agree with the Captain", Gansevoort
P07 0910  4    said thoughtfully, "but the conspiracy is ferocious
P07 0920  3    and desperate. The instinct of discipline has been
P07 0920 11    lost. Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper
P07 0930  9    hand". He paused, then added, "Everything on a ship
P07 0940  7    is a weapon. Implements of wood and iron are available
P07 0950  5    for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands.
P07 0960  4    And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so
P07 0960 15    many".
P07 0970  1       "We ourselves must stand sentinel". Alexander said.
P07 0980  1    "Under arms day and night, watch and watch about. Those
P07 0980 11    of us present, the Perry brothers, Deslonde and the
P07 0990  7    other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the
P07 1000  5    Somers. A great deal of labor we have as well, for
P07 1010  4    we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed".
P07 1020  1       And when he was alone again in the cabin, Alexander
P07 1020 11    lowered his head into his arms and wept, for he knew
P07 1030 10    full well what must be done, what in the end would
P07 1040  6    be done. With all his heart he had loved the Navy and
P07 1050  2    now he must act in accordance with the Navy's implacable
P07 1050 12    laws. And when he did, when he gave to his ship that
P07 1060 12    protection necessary to preserve her honor, he knew
P07 1070  7    he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated
P07 1080  5    his soul.
P07 1080  7       Where had he failed? How had he failed? He who had
P07 1090  7    tried so hard, who had yearned so passionately to be
P07 1100  3    a great officer. It came to him as he wept there aboard
P07 1100 15    the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness
P07 1110 11    as to seek to storm the gates of heaven. It was given
P07 1120 10    or it was not given. One did one's best and if fortune
P07 1130  7    smiled, there was a reward. One did one's best and
P07 1140  4    if fortune frowned, an eighteen-year-old boy with murder
P07 1150  1    in his heart sailed aboard one's ship. And Alexander
P07 1150 10    sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had, and he
P07 1160 12    felt no shame. God knew his tears were his to shed
P07 1170  7    if he so desired, for it had not been with an egotist's
P07 1180  3    rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career.
P07 1190  1    Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy
P07 1190 10    any egotist. It was for love that he had served the
P07 1200  9    Navy. To have someday that love returned was what he
P07 1210  5    had lived for. Now the hope was gone. Yes, he would
P07 1220  2    bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at
P07 1220 12    a price. Dear God, at what a price.
P07 1230  7       And after a while, he dried his tears and walked
P07 1240  5    the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity.
P07 1250  2    Stern-faced, he inspected the prisoners, satisfying
P07 1250  9    himself that they were clean, well fed and comfortable
P07 1260  9    within reason. The prisoners averted their eyes but
P07 1270  5    not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger. Only Cromwell,
P07 1280  3    the giant boatswain, was mild-mannered and respectful.
P07 1290  1       He said, "Captain, may I speak, please? Captain,
P07 1300  1    I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship".
P07 1300 12       "Are you, Cromwell"?
P07 1310  3       "Yes, sir. Before God I swear I am innocent. I know
P07 1320  4    nothing of any plot, if there is such a thing".
P07 1330  1       "You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt".
P07 1340  1       "I cannot speak for others, sir, but I am innocent".
P07 1340 11    He leaned closer to Alexander, squinting up at him
P07 1350  8    from the deck. "Surely, Captain, you did not find my
P07 1360  6    name on any suspicious paper or anything".
P07 1370  1       "No, Cromwell, I did not find your name. You were
P07 1370 11    careful about that".
P07 1380  3       Now Spencer, seeming with effort to shake himself
P07 1390  2    from lethargy, spoke. He said, "Cromwell is telling
P07 1390 10    you the truth. He is innocent".
P07 1400  5       Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer. The calmness
P07 1410  3    and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of
P07 1420  2    how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had
P07 1420 13    used to defend Cromwell. Alexander knew Spencer too
P07 1430  6    well to think him nai^ve or thick-skulled. And in a
P07 1440  6    sudden wave of painful clarity, Alexander recognized
P07 1450  1    a kinship with Spencer. Here was another human who
P07 1450 10    understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable.
P07 1460  8    There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip
P07 1470  7    Spencer, in handcuffs and ankle irons, knew it to be
P07 1480  5    a truth. He expected nothing for himself but that which
P07 1490  2    naturally follows those marked for misfortune. The
P07 1490  9    red-haired captain, towering above the prisoner as
P07 1500  7    a symbol of decency and authority, was shocked to find
P07 1510  5    himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer.
P07 1520  1    This tragic lad had forged his own shackles. But he
P07 1520 11    could not have done so, could not have found the way,
P07 1530 10    had fortune favored him. And because fortune had favored
P07 1540  6    neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain, they
P07 1550  3    would be each other's undoing.
P07 1550  8       "Spencer, if there is guilt, if you do not deny
P07 1560 10    your own, how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent?
P07 1570  5    He was your constant companion".
P07 1580  1       The hazel eyes met Alexander's. "I tell you he is
P07 1580 11    innocent".
P07 1590  1       "And do you think there is a reason why I should
P07 1590 12    accept your word"?
P07 1600  3       "Yes. I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell".
P07 1610  1       "Nothing to lose, either, Spencer".
P07 1620  1       "That's true", Spencer agreed and withdrew himself
P07 1620  7    from the conversation. His eyes went back to contemplation
P07 1630  7    of the sea.
P07 1630 10       "I am innocent, Captain", Cromwell said again. "Before
P07 1640  8    God, Captain, I am innocent".
P07 1650  4       And though it was logical that a man who could plot
P07 1660  4    mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth,
P07 1660 13    still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke
P07 1670  9    only for Cromwell. The boatswain was as guilty as any.
P07 1680  8    No action of his could be interpreted in his favor
P07 1690  4    and four midshipmen, prior to their knowing the significance
P07 1700  2    of the Greek paper, had seen it in Cromwell's hands
P07 1710  1    while Spencer whispered explanations.
P07 1710  5       "I thought", Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander,
P07 1720  5    "that Spencer was teaching him geometry".
P07 1730  2       It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles
P07 1740  1    to the wardroom, where a class of apprentices awaited
P07 1740 10    him. This was a training ship and the training would
P07 1750  9    continue, but there was an element of frightful absurdity
P07 1760  5    here which Alexander recognized. Some of these apprentices
P07 1770  4    were, in physical strength, already men and doubtless
P07 1780  1    a percentage of them were Spencer's followers.
