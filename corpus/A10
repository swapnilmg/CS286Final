A10 0010  1       Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary
A10 0010  8    assistant district attorney, it was announced Monday
A10 0020  7    by Charles E. Raymond, District Attorney.
A10 0030  3       Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has
A10 0040  3    been called to active military service but is expected
A10 0040 12    back on the job by March 31.
A10 0050  7       Ierulli, 29, has been practicing in Portland since
A10 0060  4    November, 1959. He is a graduate of Portland University
A10 0070  1    and the Northwestern College of Law. He is married
A10 0070 10    and the father of three children.
A10 0090  1       Helping foreign countries to build a sound political
A10 0090  9    structure is more important than aiding them economically,
A10 0100  8    E. M. Martin, assistant secretary of state for economic
A10 0110  7    affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday
A10 0120  5    night.
A10 0120  6       Martin, who has been in office in Washington, D.
A10 0130  6    C., for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting
A10 0140  4    at the Multnomah Hotel. He told some 350 persons that
A10 0150  3    the United States' challenge was to help countries
A10 0150 11    build their own societies their own ways, following
A10 0160  8    their own paths.
A10 0170  1       "We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which,
A10 0170 12    if not identical, is congenial with ours", he said
A10 0180  7    but adding that if they do not develop the kind of
A10 0190  6    society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality
A10 0200  1    and loyalty.
A10 0200  3    #PATIENCE NEEDED#
A10 0200  5    Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice,
A10 0210  6    he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union.
A10 0220  2       He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet
A10 0230  2    rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep
A10 0230 13    the people in, and added, "so long as people rebel,
A10 0240  9    we must not give up".
A10 0250  1       Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.
A10 0260  1       "The countries are trying to build in a decade the
A10 0260 10    kind of society we took a century to build", he said.
A10 0270  8       By leaving our doors open the United States gives
A10 0280  5    other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare,
A10 0290  3    he said.
A10 0290  5    #INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST#
A10 0290  8    "We have no reason to fear failure, but we must be
A10 0300  8    extraordinarily patient", the assistant secretary said.
A10 0310  3       Economically, Martin said, the United States could
A10 0320  3    best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
A10 0330  1    Private business is more effective than government
A10 0330  8    aid, he explained, because individuals are able to
A10 0340  6    work with the people themselves.
A10 0350  1       The United States must plan to absorb the exported
A10 0350 10    goods of the country, at what he termed a "social cost".
A10 0360 10       Martin said the government has been working to establish
A10 0370  8    firmer prices on primary products which may involve
A10 0380  5    the total income of one country.
A10 0390  1       The Portland school board was asked Monday to take
A10 0390 10    a positive stand towards developing and coordinating
A10 0400  6    with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's
A10 0410  6    schools in event of attack.
A10 0420  1       But there seemed to be some difference of opinion
A10 0420 10    as to how far the board should go, and whose advice
A10 0430  6    it should follow.
A10 0430  9       The board members, after hearing the coordination
A10 0440  5    plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar, 1409 SW Maplecrest
A10 0450  5    Dr., said they thought they had already been cooperating.
A10 0460  3       Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps
A10 0470  4    this was not strictly a school board problem, in case
A10 0480  1    of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate
A10 0480 10    so far as possible to get the children to where the
A10 0490  8    parents wanted them to go.
A10 0495  1       Dr. Melvin W. Barnes, superintendent, said he thought
A10 0500  5    the schools were waiting for some leadership, perhaps
A10 0510  7    on the national level, to make sure that whatever steps
A10 0520  7    of planning they took would "be more fruitful", and
A10 0530  3    that he had found that other school districts were
A10 0540  1    not as far along in their planning as this district.
A10 0540 11       "Los Angeles has said they would send the children
A10 0550  8    to their homes in case of disaster", he said. "Nobody
A10 0560  5    really expects to evacuate. I think everybody is agreed
A10 0570  4    that we need to hear some voice on the national level
A10 0580  2    that would make some sense and in which we would have
A10 0580 13    some confidence in following.
A10 0590  3       Mrs. Molvar, who kept reiterating her request that
A10 0600  2    they "please take a stand", said, "We must have faith
A10 0610  1    in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be
A10 0610 11    possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their
A10 0620 10    children".
A10 0620 11       Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling
A10 0630  9    that evacuation plans, even for a high school where
A10 0640  6    there were lots of cars "might not be realistic and
A10 0650  2    would not work".
A10 0650  5       Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking
A10 0660  6    a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program. The board
A10 0670  3    said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so
A10 0670 14    far and asked for more information to be brought at
A10 0680 10    the next meeting.
A10 0690  1       It was generally agreed that the subject was important
A10 0690 10    and the board should be informed on what was done,
A10 0700  8    is going to be done and what it thought should be done.
A10 0720  1    _SALEM (AP)_
A10 0720  3       - The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in
A10 0730  2    Salem will hear a greeting from Gov. Mark Hatfield.

A10 0830  1       Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined
A10 0830  9    blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior
A10 0840  7    high schools at a Monday night workshop session.
A10 0850  5       A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5
A10 0860  4    million for construction of the two 900-student schools
A10 0870  1    was defeated by district voters in January.
A10 0870  8       Last week the board, by a 4 to 3 vote, decided to
A10 0890  6    ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 (junior high
A10 0900  6    school) system or the 8-4 system. Board members indicated
A10 0910  2    Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll
A10 0910 12    to be taken on Nov. 15, the same date as a $581,000
A10 0920 11    bond election for the construction of three new elementary
A10 0930  6    schools.

A10 1150  1       A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp
A10 1150 11    on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the
A10 1160  9    29th general council of the Assemblies of God, in session
A10 1170  7    at the Memorial Coliseum.
A10 1180  1       The council revised, in an effort to strengthen,
A10 1180  8    the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.
A10 1190  7       The changes, unanimously adopted, were felt necessary
A10 1200  4    in the face of modern trends away from the Bible. The
A10 1210  3    council agreed it should more firmly state its belief
A10 1210 12    in and dependence on the Bible.
A10 1220  6       At the adoption, the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman, general
A10 1230  4    superintendent, commented, "The Assemblies of God has
A10 1240  4    been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days
A10 1250  1    and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths
A10 1250 10    of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing
A10 1260 10    to give their lives".
A10 1270  1    #NEW POINT ADDED#
A10 1270  4    Many changes involved minor editing and clarification;
A10 1280  1    however, the first belief stood for entire revision
A10 1280  9    with a new third point added to the list.
A10 1290  8       The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination, now
A10 1300  4    reads:
A10 1300  5       "The scriptures, both Old and New Testament, are
A10 1310  4    verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of
A10 1320  2    God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith
A10 1320 11    and conduct".
A10 1330  1       The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the
A10 1330  9    Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ, and:
A10 1340  7       - emphasizes the Virgin birth
A10 1350  1       - the sinless life of Christ
A10 1350  6       - His miracles
A10 1360  3       - His substitutionary work on the cross
A10 1360  9       - His bodily resurrection from the dead
A10 1370  5       - and His exaltation to the right hand of God.
A10 1380  4    #SUPER AGAIN ELECTED#
A10 1380  7    Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected
A10 1390  6    for his second consecutive two-year term as general
A10 1400  4    superintendent of Assemblies of God. His offices are
A10 1410  2    in Springfield, Mo. Election came on the nominating
A10 1410 10    ballot.
A10 1420  1       Friday night the delegates heard the need for their
A10 1420 10    forthcoming program, "Breakthrough" scheduled to fill
A10 1430  6    the churches for the next two years. In his opening
A10 1440  7    address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, urged the
A10 1450  4    delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program,
A10 1460  1    with "Breakthrough" the theme for the first two years.
A10 1470  1       The Rev. R. L. Brandt, national secretary of the
A10 1470  9    home missions department, stressed the need for the
A10 1480  7    first two years' work.
A10 1490  1       "Surveys show that one out of three Americans has
A10 1490 10    vital contact with the church. This means that more
A10 1500  8    than 100 million have no vital touch with the church
A10 1510  5    or religious life", he told delegates Friday.
A10 1520  1    #CHURCH LOSES PACE#
A10 1520  4    Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards of
A10 1530  2    12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering
A10 1530 10    the United States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said "our
A10 1540  9    organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge".
A10 1550  7       "In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches", the
A10 1560  5    Rev. Mr. Brandt said, adding that the denomination
A10 1570  3    had a national goal of one church for every 10,000
A10 1580  1    persons.
A10 1580  2       "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois,
A10 1590  1    where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we
A10 1590 11    have 60; we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none",
A10 1600 10    he said.
A10 1600 12       To step up the denomination's program, the Rev.
A10 1610  7    Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies
A10 1620  7    of God churches in the next 10 years.
A10 1630  2       To accomplish this would necessitate some changes
A10 1630  9    in methods, he said.
A10 1640  3    #'CHURCH MEETS CHANGE'#
A10 1640  6    "The church's ability to change her methods is going
A10 1650  8    to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this
A10 1660  5    hour".
A10 1660  6       A capsule view of proposed plans includes:
A10 1670  1       - Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies
A10 1680  1    of God churches to start new churches.
A10 1680  8       - Engaging mature, experienced men to pioneer or
A10 1690  7    open new churches in strategic population centers.
A10 1700  1       - Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers
A10 1710  2    (laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of
A10 1710 13    new churches in the interest of lending their support
A10 1720  9    to the new project).
A10 1730  3       - Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from
A10 1730 10    6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches.
A10 1750  1       U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions
A10 1760  1    made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance
A10 1760  9    fraud trial.
A10 1770  2       Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance,
A10 1770  9    mistrial, separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony
A10 1780  7    and directed verdict.
A10 1790  2       In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated
A10 1800  1    that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other
A10 1800 11    courts and that "a person may join a conspiracy without
A10 1810  8    knowing who all of the conspirators are".
A10 1820  2       Attorney Dwight L. Schwab, in behalf of defendant
A10 1830  2    Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking
A10 1830 10    Weinstein to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared
A10 1840  8    this is a matter for the jury to decide.
A10 1850  6    #PROOF LACK CHARGED#
A10 1850  9    Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's
A10 1860  7    entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud,
A10 1870  5    to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied:
A10 1880  3       "It is not necessary that a defendant actually have
A10 1890  3    conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as
A10 1900  2    there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were
A10 1900 12    then used to carry it out".
A10 1910  5       In the afternoon, defense attorneys began the presentation
A10 1920  3    of their cases with opening statements, some of which
A10 1930  1    had been deferred until after the government had called
A10 1930 10    witnesses and presented its case.
