E30 0010  1    #GENERAL#
E30 0010  2    How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives
E30 0020  1    of your benefit and service program? Have you permitted
E30 0020 10    it to become a giveaway program rather than one that
E30 0030  8    has the goal of improved employee morale and, consequently,
E30 0040  4    increased productivity?
E30 0040  6       What effort do you make to assess results of your
E30 0050 10    program? Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism,
E30 0060  6    turnover, accidents, and grievances, and to improved
E30 0070  4    quality and output?
E30 0070  7       Have you set specific objectives for your employee
E30 0080  5    publication? Is it reaching these goals? Is it larger
E30 0090  5    or fancier than you really need? Are you using the
E30 0100  2    most economical printing methods, paper, etc. Are
E30 0100  9    there other, cheaper communications techniques that
E30 0110  5    could be substituted?
E30 0120  1       Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged
E30 0120  8    an excess of free "government" work in your plant?
E30 0130  8       Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying
E30 0140  7    service for employees?
E30 0150  1       When improvements are recommended in working conditions-
E30 0150  8    such as lighting, rest rooms, eating facilities,
E30 0160  6    air-conditioning-
E30 0160  8    do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness
E30 0170  8    on productivity?
E30 0170 10       When negotiating with your union, do you make sure
E30 0180  9    employees have a choice between new benefits and their
E30 0190  6    cents-per-hour cost in wages.
E30 0200  1       Can you consider restricting any additional employee
E30 0200  8    benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money,
E30 0210  7    such as was done in the union contract recently signed
E30 0220  3    by American Motors Corporation?
E30 0220  7    #INSURANCE#
E30 0230  1    Do your employees understand all the benefits to which
E30 0230 10    your insurance entitles them? Are they encouraged to
E30 0240  7    take full legal advantage of these benefits? Have you
E30 0250  6    publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's
E30 0260  4    share of insurance premiums?
E30 0260  8       When did you last compare your present premium costs
E30 0270  7    with the costs of insurance from other sources?
E30 0280  4       Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative
E30 0290  2    costs?
E30 0290  3       Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed
E30 0300  4    (as opposed to fully company-paid) programs?
E30 0310  1    #HOLIDAYS, TIME OFF, OVERTIME#
E30 0310  5    Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance
E30 0320  5    requirement both before and after the holiday?
E30 0330  1       Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area
E30 0330 10    and/or industrial patterns?
E30 0340  3       Have you investigated the possibility of moving
E30 0350  3    midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday
E30 0350 12    in order to have an uninterrupted work week?
E30 0360  8       Are you carefully policing wash-up time and rest
E30 0370  7    periods to be certain that all other time is productive?
E30 0380  3       Are you watching work schedules for boiler operators,
E30 0390  2    guards, and other 24-hour-day, 7-day-week operations
E30 0390 12    in order to minimize overtime?
E30 0400  4       Are you careful to restrict the number of people
E30 0410  3    on leave at one time so that your total employment
E30 0410 13    obligation is minimized?
E30 0420  3    #PLANT FEEDING FACILITIES#
E30 0420  6    Have you considered using vending equipment to replace
E30 0430  6    or reduce the number of cafeteria employees?
E30 0440  2       What are the possibilities for operating your cafeteria
E30 0450  2    for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines
E30 0460  1    or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift
E30 0460 11    operations?
E30 0470  1       Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your
E30 0470  9    cafeteria operation in order to save administrative
E30 0480  7    costs?
E30 0480  8       Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help
E30 0490  6    work part-time on custodial or other jobs?
E30 0500  3       Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity
E30 0510  1    strain on your feeding facilities?
E30 0510  6       Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order
E30 0520  6    to reduce feeding costs?
E30 0520 10       Have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies
E30 0530  5    to your in-plant feeding operation?
E30 0540  1       Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings
E30 0550  1    or discussions?
E30 0550  3    #RECREATION FACILITIES#
E30 0550  5    Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the
E30 0560  6    number of employees who benefit from your program?
E30 0570  3       Have you audited your program recently to weed out
E30 0580  2    those phases that draw least participation?
E30 0580  8       Do employees contribute their share of money to
E30 0590  7    recreational facilities?
E30 0600  1       Have you considered delegating operational responsibility
E30 0600  6    to your employee association and carefully restricting
E30 0610  5    your plant's financial contribution?
E30 0620  2       Could an employee's garden club take over partial
E30 0630  1    care of plant grounds? Would a camera club be useful
E30 0630 11    in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety?
E30 0640  6       Are you spending too much money on team uniforms
E30 0650  5    that benefit only a few employees? Are you underwriting
E30 0660  2    expensive team trips?
E30 0660  5       Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help
E30 0670  5    pay for your program?
E30 0670  9    #TRANSPORTATION AND PARKING#
E30 0680  3    Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access
E30 0690  1    roads and parking lots?
E30 0690  5       If you use parking attendants, can they be replaced
E30 0700  4    by automatic parking gates?
E30 0700  8       Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain
E30 0710  6    the bus stops at your plant?
E30 0720  1       If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this
E30 0720  9    be replaced by available public transportation? If
E30 0730  6    you use company transportation to meet trains or to
E30 0740  6    haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?
E30 0750  1       How efficient and necessary are your intra-company
E30 0750  9    vehicles? Can they be re-scheduled? Can part-time drivers
E30 0760  9    be assigned to other productive work?
E30 0770  3    #PAID VACATIONS#
E30 0770  5    Which is more economical for your plant- a vacation
E30 0780  5    shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees
E30 0790  2    for vacation fill-ins?
E30 0790  6       Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months
E30 0800  5    to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?
E30 0810  1       Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take
E30 0810  9    their vacations during plant shutdowns?
E30 0820  4       What can your sales and purchasing departments do
E30 0830  3    to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation
E30 0840  1    shutdown periods?
E30 0840  3    #RETIREMENT#
E30 0840  4    Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing
E30 0850  6    your plant money?
E30 0850  9       What sort of effort do you make to assure that older
E30 0860  9    or disabled workers are fully productive? Would early
E30 0870  4    retirement of non-productive, disabled employees reduce
E30 0880  2    the number of make-work jobs?
E30 0880  8       Will your union accept seniority concessions in
E30 0890  5    assigning work for older or disabled employees?
E30 0900  1    #MEDICAL AND HEALTH#
E30 0900  4    Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring
E30 0910  5    plants?
E30 0910  6       If you have a full-time doctor now, can he be replaced
E30 0920  7    with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case
E30 0930  6    basis only?
E30 0930  8       Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid
E30 0940  6    man who works full-time on some other assignment?
E30 0950  1       Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected
E30 0960  1    health problems and avoid treating the latter?
E30 0960  8       Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical
E30 0970  6    services- flu shots, sun lamp treatments, etc.?
E30 0980  5       If you have an annual or regular physical examination
E30 0990  3    program, is it worth what it is costing you?
E30 1000  1    #A PROGRAM TO FIT YOUR NEEDS#
E30 1000  7    Consider what you can afford to spend and what your
E30 1010  6    goals are before setting up or revamping your employee
E30 1020  1    benefit program. Too many plant officials are all too
E30 1020 10    eager to buy a package program from an insurance company
E30 1030  9    simply because it works for another plant.
E30 1040  4       But even if that other plant employs the same number
E30 1050  3    of workers and makes the same product, there are other
E30 1050 13    facts to consider. How old is your working force? What's
E30 1060 10    your profit margin? In what section of the country
E30 1070  8    are you located? Are you in a rural or urban area?
E30 1080  8    These factors can make the difference between waste
E30 1090  3    and efficiency in any benefit program.
E30 1090  9       Above all, don't set up extravagant fringe benefits
E30 1100  7    just to buy employee good will. Unions stress fringe
E30 1110  5    benefits, but the individual hourly worker prefers
E30 1120  2    cash every time.
E30 1120  5       Aim to balance your employee benefit package. Some
E30 1130  3    plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal
E30 1140  1    retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere.
E30 1140  8    They're asking for union trouble.
E30 1150  5    #COMMUNICATIONS#
E30 1150  6    If you want credit for your employee services program,
E30 1160  6    let your workers know what they're entitled to. Encourage
E30 1170  4    them to exercise their benefits. This can be done by
E30 1180  5    stories in your house organs, posters, special publications,
E30 1185  2    letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth
E30 1190  5    through your chain of command.
E30 1190 10       Some companies find a little imagination helpful.
E30 1200  6    Hallmark Cards, Inc., Kansas City, Mo., has a do-it-yourself
E30 1210  8    quiz game called "Benefit Bafflers", which it distributes
E30 1220  4    to employees. M + R Dietetic Laboratories, Inc.,
E30 1230  2    Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook-
E30 1240  3    each check showing the amount the company spends on
E30 1240 12    a particular fringe. U. S. Rubber Company, New York,
E30 1250  8    passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits.
E30 1260  6    The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package,
E30 1270  4    for example, costs $227.72.
E30 1270  8    #INSURANCE#
E30 1270  9    Have the insurance company or your own accounting department
E30 1280  9    break down the cost of your insurance package periodically.
E30 1290  8    You may find certain coverage costing much more than
E30 1300  6    is economically feasible, thereby alerting you to desirable
E30 1310  4    revisions.
E30 1310  5       Check to see if some of your benefits- such as on-the-job
E30 1320  6    disability pay- can be put on a direct payment rather
E30 1330  3    than an insured basis at a savings to you.
E30 1340  1       Use deductable insurance wherever feasible. It can
E30 1340  8    put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with
E30 1350  6    your insurance rates. Also, beware of open-end policies,
E30 1360  5    especially in the medical field. This will mean that
E30 1370  2    every time there's an increase in hospital rates your
E30 1370 11    cost will go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents
E30 1380 11    limit on benefits.
E30 1390  1       Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits
E30 1390  9    only upon death. Generally, your employee will greatly
E30 1400  6    appreciate benefits that protect him during his working
E30 1410  6    life or during retirement.
E30 1410 10    #SPECIAL TIME OFF#
E30 1420  2    In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum
E30 1420  9    time off and list what the worker's relation to the
E30 1430  9    deceased must be to qualify. Thus, you avoid headaches
E30 1440  5    when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's
E30 1450  2    funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of
E30 1460  1    death despite the fact that you'll probably never use
E30 1460 10    it.
E30 1460 11       Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated.
E30 1470 10    Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the
E30 1480  8    cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of
E30 1490  3    production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria,
E30 1500  1    let a few workers in each department get it for the
E30 1500 12    whole group. Consider installing supplemental serving
E30 1510  4    lines in production areas. Make sure milk for the coffee
E30 1520  6    is placed in dispensers rather than in containers,
E30 1530  1    if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may
E30 1530 10    be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers.
E30 1540 10    #RETIREMENT POLICIES#
E30 1550  1    Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen
E30 1550  9    such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job
E30 1560 10    for the convenience of the company. And so deadheads
E30 1570  4    on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible
E30 1580  2    age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job
E30 1580 14    requirements tied into your pension plan. Younger men
E30 1590  8    usually don't think of pensions as an important job
E30 1600  7    benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change
E30 1610  4    jobs several times before settling down.
E30 1610 10       Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory
E30 1620  7    pension plans. There are two sides of a coin for this
E30 1630 10    decision. Workers usually think more of a plan they
E30 1640  6    contribute to. And they can at least collect the money
E30 1650  3    they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company.
E30 1650 13    A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the
E30 1660 10    worker until he retires. Thus, there is an added incentive
E30 1670  8    to stay on the job.
E30 1670 13    #HOLIDAYS#
E30 1680  1    Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when
E30 1680 11    an employee would not otherwise be working. These include:
E30 1690  8    leaves of absences, illnesses, and layoffs.
E30 1700  4       Consider adopting a system of holidays in which
E30 1710  3    time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience
E30 1720  1    to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too
E30 1720 11    hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer
E30 1730  9    holiday periods. For example, the Friday after Thanksgiving
E30 1740  5    can be substituted for Washington's birthday. This
E30 1750  3    reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and
E30 1760  1    startups.
E30 1760  2       Require each employee to work his last shift both
E30 1770  1    before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay.
E30 1770 11    This cuts the absentee rate.
E30 1780  2    #EATING FACILITIES#
E30 1780  4    Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized
E30 1790  4    cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable
E30 1800  1    prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire
E30 1800 11    runs the cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and
E30 1810  9    price. If the soup tastes like dishwater, your employees
E30 1820  5    won't blame the concessionaire. You'll take the rap.
E30 1830  4       Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's
E30 1840  2    convenient for most employees. You may save valuable
E30 1840 10    production minutes with a change.
E30 1850  5    #VACATIONS#
E30 1850  6    Spread your vacation period over the widest possible
E30 1860  5    span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks.
E30 1870  2    This will cut the expense of vacation replacements.
E30 1870 10    And with the shutdown method there will be no argument
E30 1880  9    as to who gets the choice vacation dates.
E30 1890  3       Also make sure you have reasonable requirements
E30 1900  1    as to hours worked before a production employee is
E30 1900 10    entitled to a vacation. You might try providing standard
E30 1910  7    vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend
E30 1920  5    on the number of hours worked in the previous year.
