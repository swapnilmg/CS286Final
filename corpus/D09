D09 0010  1    Few persons who join the Church are insincere. They
D09 0010 10    earnestly desire to do the will of God. When they fall
D09 0020 10    by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature,
D09 0030  3    it is an indictment of the Church. These fatalities
D09 0040  2    are dramatic evidence of "halfway evangelism", a failure
D09 0050  1    to follow through. A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism
D09 0050 10    can end in dismal defeat with half the new members
D09 0060 10    drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous
D09 0070  5    efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship.
D09 0080  2       The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed
D09 0090  2    when all of the persons on the Responsibility List
D09 0090 11    have been interviewed. In the average situation about
D09 0100  8    one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ
D09 0110  5    and the Church. The pastor and the Membership Preparation
D09 0120  3    and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately
D09 0130  3    with a carefully planned program. The first thirty
D09 0140  1    to sixty days after individuals make their decision
D09 0140  9    will determine their interest and participation in
D09 0150  6    the life of the Church. Neglect means spiritual paralysis
D09 0160  4    or death.
D09 0160  6    #PREPARATION FOR MEMBERSHIP#
D09 0160  9    CHURCHES THAT HAVE a carefully planned program of membership
D09 0170  9    preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per
D09 0180  9    cent of their new members loyal and active. This is
D09 0190  6    the answer to the problem of "membership delinquency".
D09 0200  2       It is important that persons desiring to unite with
D09 0210  3    the Church be prepared for this experience so that
D09 0210 12    it may be meaningful and spiritually significant. It
D09 0220  8    is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the
D09 0230  8    sacred vows of Church membership before he has been
D09 0240  5    carefully instructed concerning their implications.
D09 0250  1       Preparation for Church membership begins immediately
D09 0250  7    after the commitment is received.
D09 0260  5    _1)_
D09 0260  6       The pastor writes a personal letter to each individual,
D09 0270  4    expressing his joy over the decision, assuring him
D09 0280  2    of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time,
D09 0280 11    and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes
D09 0290  7    and Membership Sunday. Some pastors write a letter
D09 0300  6    the same night the decision is reported by the visitors.
D09 0310  4    It should not be postponed later than the next day.
D09 0320  1    A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter.
D09 0320 10    _2)_
D09 0320 11       The pastor calls in the home of each individual
D09 0330  8    or family for a spiritual guidance conference. If possible,
D09 0340  4    he should make an appointment in order that all persons
D09 0350  4    involved may be present. This is not a social call.
D09 0360  2    It is definitely a "spiritual guidance conference".
D09 0360  9    He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment,
D09 0370  8    the necessity of family religion and private devotions,
D09 0380  7    and the importance of the membership preparation sessions.
D09 0390  4    There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief
D09 0400  4    which will require his counsel. Each conference should
D09 0410  2    be concluded naturally with prayer. A piece of devotional
D09 0410 11    material, such as The Upper Room, may be left in each
D09 0420 11    home.
D09 0430  1    _3)_
D09 0430  1       A minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership
D09 0430 10    is necessary for adults. Some churches require more.
D09 0440  7    None should ask less. Those who join the Church need
D09 0450  7    to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian
D09 0460  4    discipleship before they take the sacred vows. They
D09 0470  3    will have a greater appreciation for the Church and
D09 0470 12    a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something
D09 0480  8    of them.
D09 0480 10       Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be
D09 0490  9    the most practical time for adult preparation classes.
D09 0500  5    Others meet on Sunday night, at the mid-week service,
D09 0510  4    or for a series of four nights. Some pastors have two
D09 0520  2    sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period
D09 0520 10    between.
D09 0530  1       The sessions should cover four major areas:
D09 0530  7    _A_
D09 0530  8       - The Christian Faith
D09 0540  2    _B_
D09 0540  3       - History of the Church
D09 0540  7    _C_
D09 0540  8       - Duties of Church Membership
D09 0550  2    _D_
D09 0550  3       - The Local Church and Its Program
D09 0560  1       Following each instruction period a piece of literature
D09 0560  9    dealing with the topic should be handed each one for
D09 0570 10    further reading during the week. This procedure is
D09 0580  5    much more effective than giving out a membership packet.
D09 0590  2    #FOURTH SESSION IMPORTANT#
D09 0590  5    MOST PASTORS FIND that the fourth session should take
D09 0600  7    at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week
D09 0610  6    night prior to Reception Sunday. In this session the
D09 0620  2    persons seeking membership are provided information
D09 0620  8    concerning the work of the denomination as well as
D09 0630  8    the program and activities of the local church. The
D09 0640  4    lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak
D09 0650  1    on the various phases of church life, service opportunities,
D09 0650 10    the church school, missions, men's work, women's work,
D09 0660  7    youth program, social activities, and finances. The
D09 0670  5    budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited
D09 0680  4    at this session. An "interest finder" or "talent sheet"
D09 0690  3    may be filled out by each person. (See sample on pp.
D09 0700  2    78-79.) The fourth session may be concluded with a
D09 0700 12    tour of the church facilities and refreshments. The
D09 0710  6    social time gives an opportunity for church leaders
D09 0720  4    to become acquainted with the new members.
D09 0720 11    #ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP PREPARATION#
D09 0730  5    IN CONDUCTING the Membership Preparation-Inquirers'
D09 0740  5    Class, the pastor should plan a variety of teaching
D09 0750  6    techniques in order to develop greater interest on
D09 0760  2    the part of the class. The following have been found
D09 0760 12    effective.
D09 0770  1    _1)_
D09 0770  2       Extend the number of classes. Some churches have
D09 0780  1    six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally
D09 0780 11    held on Sunday night or during the week. This gives
D09 0790  8    greater opportunity for the learning process.
D09 0800  3    _2)_
D09 0800  4       Use dramatization- for example, in discussing the
D09 0810  3    Lord's Supper or church symbolism.
D09 0810  8    _3)_
D09 0810  9       Use audio-visual aids. Some excellent filmstrips
D09 0820  7    with recordings and motion pictures may be secured
D09 0830  5    from your denominational headquarters to enrich the
D09 0840  3    class session.
D09 0840  5    _4)_
D09 0840  6       Have a "Question Box". Some new members will hesitate
D09 0850  6    to ask questions audibly. Urge them to write out their
D09 0860  5    questions for the box.
D09 0860  9    _5)_
D09 0860 10       Use a textbook with assigned readings each week.
D09 0870  6    _6)_
D09 0870  7       Select class members for reports on various phases
D09 0880  5    of the study.
D09 0880  8    _7)_
D09 0880  9       Conduct examinations, using a true-false check sheet.
D09 0890  7    _8)_
D09 0890  8       Ask each member to write a statement on such topics
D09 0900  8    as: "What Christ Means to Me", "What the Church Means
D09 0910  6    to Me", "Why Join the Church", "The Duties of Church
D09 0920  5    Members", etc.
D09 0920  7    _9)_
D09 0920  8       Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized.
D09 0930  9    _10)_
D09 0940  1       Invite class members to share in an extra period
D09 0940  9    of Bible study each week.
D09 0950  2    _11)_
D09 0950  3       Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty
D09 0960  1    to the Reception Service.
D09 0960  5    #WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERS?#
D09 0960  8    THERE IS A GROWING CONVICTION among pastors and Church
D09 0970  9    leaders that all those who come into the fellowship
D09 0980  8    of the Church need preparatory training, including
D09 0990  3    those coming by transfer of membership. George E. Sweazey
D09 1000  2    writes: "There is danger in trying to make admission
D09 1010  1    to the Church so easy and painless that people will
D09 1010 11    scarcely know that anything has happened".
D09 1020  5       People appreciate experiences that demand something
D09 1030  4    of them. Those who transfer their membership are no
D09 1040  2    exception to the rule. For most of them, it will be
D09 1040 13    their first experience in membership training, since
D09 1050  6    this is a recent development in many churches. Those
D09 1060  5    coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity
D09 1070  3    to become informed.
D09 1070  6       The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face
D09 1080  6    group in which new members become acquainted with one
D09 1090  3    another. It provides a natural transition into the
D09 1090 11    life of the local church and its organizations.
D09 1100  8    #RECEPTION INTO THE CHURCH FELLOWSHIP#
D09 1110  2    THE TOTAL PROCESS of evangelism reaches the crescendo
D09 1120  1    when the group of new members stands before the congregation
D09 1120 11    to declare publicly their faith and to be received
D09 1130  9    into the fellowship of the Church. This should be a
D09 1140  8    high moment in their lives, a never-to-be-forgotten
D09 1150  1    experience. They should sense the tremendous significance
D09 1160  1    of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to
D09 1160  9    Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship
D09 1170  8    with the saints of the ages.
D09 1180  1       Every detail of the service merits careful attention-
D09 1180  9    the hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of
D09 1190 10    fellowship, the introduction to the congregation, the
D09 1200  5    welcome of the congregation. This is a vital part of
D09 1210  5    their spiritual growth and assimilation. It will help
D09 1220  1    to determine the attitude of the new members toward
D09 1220 10    the Church. It can mean the difference between participation
D09 1230  7    and inaction, spiritual growth and decay.
D09 1240  4       The worship service is the natural and logical time
D09 1250  2    to receive new members into the Church. The atmosphere
D09 1250 11    for this momentous experience can be created most effectively
D09 1260  9    through the worship experience. Psychologically the
D09 1270  5    reception should be the climax, following the sermon.
D09 1280  5    _1)_
D09 1280  6       Ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before
D09 1290  3    the service to complete "talent sheets" and pledge
D09 1300  1    cards. Some denominations ask new members to sign personally
D09 1300 10    the chronological membership register. Provide a name
D09 1310  7    card for each new member. Outline plans for the entire
D09 1320  8    service.
D09 1320  9    _2)_
D09 1320 10       Arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where
D09 1330  7    all new members may sit together. Sponsors may sit
D09 1340  4    with them also.
D09 1340  7    _3)_
D09 1340  8       Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back
D09 1350  5    of the new members in the reception service.
D09 1360  1    _4)_
D09 1360  2       Give each new member a certificate of membership.
D09 1360 10    _5)_
D09 1370  1       Introduce each new member to the congregation, asking
D09 1370  9    him to face the congregation.
D09 1380  3    _6)_
D09 1380  4       Lead the congregation in a response of welcome.
D09 1390  2    _7)_
D09 1390  3       Have a reception for new members in the parlor or
D09 1400  1    social hall immediately after the service.
D09 1400  7    _8)_
D09 1400  8       Take a picture of the group of new members to be
D09 1410  8    put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board.
D09 1420  3    _9)_
D09 1420  4       Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members
D09 1430  3    as guests.
D09 1430  5    #CHAPTER 6 PLANNING FOR THE ASSIMILATION AND GROWTH
D09 1440  2    OF NEW MEMBERS#
D09 1440  5    THE CHURCH is "the family of God". The members of the
D09 1450  5    "family" are drawn together by a common love for Christ
D09 1460  3    and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom. Every member
D09 1470  1    of the family must have a vital place in its life.
D09 1470 12    This is no spectator-type experience; everyone is to
D09 1480  5    be a participant.
D09 1480  8       Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program
D09 1490  8    of evangelism is right at this point- helping new members
D09 1500  7    to become participating, growing parts of the fellowship.
D09 1510  5    Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join
D09 1520  2    the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.
D09 1520  9       A study of major denominational membership statistics
D09 1530  6    over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact
D09 1540  5    that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church
D09 1550  4    were lost to the Church within seven years. One denomination
D09 1560  2    had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the
D09 1570  1    period under study, and twenty years later its membership
D09 1570 10    stood at 1,541,991- a net growth of only 122,158. Yet
D09 1580 10    during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions.
D09 1590  4    Another major church body had 4,499,608 members and
D09 1600  3    twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444.
D09 1600 11    During this time 4,122,354 new members were brought
D09 1610  8    into the fellowship. Still another denomination had
D09 1620  5    7,360,187 members twenty years ago. During this period
D09 1630  3    7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership
D09 1640  1    now is only 9,910,741. These figures indicate that
D09 1640  9    we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into
D09 1650  9    membership.
D09 1650 10       This problem is illustrated by the fact that many
D09 1660  8    local churches drop from the active membership rolls
D09 1670  4    each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.
D09 1680  1    Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where
D09 1680 10    population is expanding, show that numbers of churches
D09 1690  8    have had little net increase, though many new members
D09 1700  6    were received. Something is wrong when these things
D09 1710  3    happen. The local "family of God" has failed its new
D09 1720  2    members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual
D09 1720 10    welfare.
D09 1730  1    #BASIC NEEDS#
D09 1730  3    NEW MEMBERS can become participating, growing members.
D09 1740  2    But this will not happen merely through the natural
D09 1740 11    process of social life. It must be planned and carefully
D09 1750 10    developed. The entire membership of the local church
D09 1760  7    must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process.
D09 1770  5       If the church has followed the plan of cultivation
D09 1780  3    of prospects and carried through a program of membership
D09 1790  1    preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process
D09 1790 10    of assimilation and growth will be well under way.
D09 1800  8    Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently
D09 1810  6    and with Christian dedication will not so easily step
D09 1820  5    through the back door because of lost interest.
D09 1830  1       However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian
D09 1830 11    commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian
D09 1840  9    discipleship. When they unite with the Church they
D09 1850  7    must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their
D09 1860  3    basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into
D09 1870  1    effective Christians.
D09 1870  3       The Church expects certain things of those who become
D09 1880  4    members. The new members justifiably expect some things
D09 1890  1    from their church family:
D09 1890  5       - Welcome into the fellowship
D09 1900  3       - Sincere Christian love and understanding
D09 1900  8       - Inspiring and challenging worship experiences
D09 1910  5       - Social and recreational activities
D09 1920  1       - Opportunities for Christian service
D09 1930  3       - Opportunities for study of the Christian faith
D09 1930 10    and the Bible
D09 1940  3       - Creative prayer experiences
D09 1940  6       - Guidance in Christian social concerns
