A09 0010  1       City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday
A09 0010  7    that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project
A09 0020  8    were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting
A09 0030  5    company which had "an inside track" with the city.
A09 0040  4       Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job
A09 0050  2    have ranged as high as $200,000.
A09 0050  8    #'SHORTCUTS' UNNOTICED#
A09 0060  1    Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted
A09 0060 10    to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid
A09 0070 12    that was far less than the "legitimate" bids of competing
A09 0080  6    contractors.
A09 0080  7       The Hughes concern then took "shortcuts" on the
A09 0090  7    project but got paid anyway, Hemphill said.
A09 0100  3       The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest
A09 0110  3    development in an investigation which also brought
A09 0110 10    these disclosures Tuesday:
A09 0120  3       The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400
A09 0130  4    performance bond covering the contract.
A09 0130  9       The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating
A09 0140  6    the part its organization played in reviewing the project.
A09 0150  7       The signature of Harold V. Varani, former director
A09 0160  6    of architecture and engineering in the Department of
A09 0170  5    Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers certifying
A09 0180  2    work on the project. Varani has been fired on charges
A09 0180 12    of accepting gifts from the contractor.
A09 0190  6       Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to
A09 0200  6    cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp
A09 0210  4    disagreement on the matter.
A09 0210  8       The announcement that the city would sue for recovery
A09 0220  8    on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor
A09 0230  4    David Berger at a press conference following a meeting
A09 0240  3    in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the
A09 0240 13    city and the PTC as well as representatives of an
A09 0250 10    engineering firm that was pulled off the El project
A09 0260  7    before its completion in 1959.
A09 0260 12    #CONCERN BANKRUPT#
A09 0270  2    The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries,
A09 0280  1    Inc., both of 3646 N. 2d st., filed for reorganization
A09 0280 11    under the Federal bankruptcy law. On Monday, the Hughes
A09 0290  9    concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors
A09 0300  6    indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization.
A09 0310  7       Business relations between the companies and city
A09 0320  5    have been under investigation by Hemphill and District
A09 0330  2    Attorney James C. Crumlish, Jr.
A09 0330  7    #INTERVENES IN CASE#
A09 0340  2    The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas
A09 0340 13    Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding
A09 0350  9    firms. Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental
A09 0360  5    Casualty Co.
A09 0360  7       At Berger's direction, the city also intervened
A09 0370  6    in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court
A09 0380  6    in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.
A09 0390  2       "I am taking the position that the contract was
A09 0390 11    clearly violated", Berger said.
A09 0400  4       The contract violations mostly involve failure to
A09 0410  4    perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along
A09 0420  1    the El track. The contract called for overhauling of
A09 0420 10    102 joints. The city paid for work on 75, of which
A09 0430 10    no more than 21 were repaired, Hemphill charged.
A09 0440  3    #WIDE RANGE IN BIDS#
A09 0440  7    Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the
A09 0450  6    repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint. The bid from
A09 0460  5    A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass., which listed
A09 0470  3    the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.
A09 0480  1       But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors
A09 0480  8    ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint.
A09 0490  5       Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of
A09 0500  3    the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the
A09 0500 12    morning press conference. Wagner said the city paid
A09 0510  8    only $37,500 to the Hughes company. "We won't know
A09 0520  5    the full amount until we get a full report", Wagner
A09 0530  3    said.
A09 0530  4       "We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond",
A09 0540  4    Berger said.
A09 0540  6       Wagner replied, "Can't you just see the headline:
A09 0550  5    'City Hooked for $172,000'"?
A09 0550  9    #'KNOW ENOUGH TO SUE'#
A09 0560  4    Berger insisted that "we know enough to sue for the
A09 0570  4    full amount".
A09 0570  6       Douglas M. Pratt, president of the PTC, who attended
A09 0580  5    the meeting, said the transit company is reviewing
A09 0590  2    the work on the El.
A09 0590  7       "We want to find out who knew about it", Pratt said.
A09 0600  5    "Certain people must have known about it".
A09 0610  1       "The PTC is investigating the whole matter", Pratt
A09 0620  1    said.
A09 0630  1       Samuel D. Goodis, representing the Philadelphia
A09 0630  7    Hotel Association, objected on Tuesday to a proposed
A09 0640  7    boost by the city in licensing fees, saying that occupancy
A09 0650  5    rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent
A09 0660  6    last year.
A09 0660  8       Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's
A09 0670  3    Finance Committee.
A09 0670  5       For hotels with 1000 rooms, the increased license
A09 0680  6    fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year, Goodis said.
A09 0690  5    #TESTIFIES AT HEARING#
A09 0690  8    His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising
A09 0700  8    fees for a wide variety of licenses, permits and city
A09 0710  4    services. The new fees are expected to raise an additional
A09 0720  1    $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more
A09 0720 10    a year after that.
A09 0730  3       The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming
A09 0740  1    houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room.
A09 0740 11    The cost of a license now is $2, with an annual renewal
A09 0750  9    fee of $1.
A09 0750 12       Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent
A09 0760  8    of the accomodations in some hotels.
A09 0770  2    #REVENUE ESTIMATED#
A09 0770  4    The city expects the higher rooming house, hotel and
A09 0780  4    apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000
A09 0790  1    a year.
A09 0790  3       The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan,
A09 0800  1    spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia,
A09 0800  9    on behalf of association members who operate apartment
A09 0810  8    houses.
A09 0810  9       A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection
A09 0820 10    from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised
A09 0830  6    pedigreed dogs. The ordinance would increase fees from
A09 0840  5    $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog.
A09 0850  4    #COMMISSIONER REPLIES#
A09 0850  6    Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should
A09 0860  5    be penalized for the city's services to animal care.
A09 0870  2       In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary
A09 0880  2    said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually
A09 0880 11    to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000
A09 0890  8    in fees.
A09 0890 10       He reported that the city's contributions for animal
A09 0900  7    care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A.; $15,000
A09 0910  6    to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000
A09 0920  7    to investigate dog bites.
A09 0920 11    #BACKS HIGHER FEES#
A09 0930  3    City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed
A09 0940  2    the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study
A09 0940 12    for more than a year. The city is not adequately compensated
A09 0950 10    for the services covered by the fees, he said.
A09 0960  7       The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner
A09 0970  4    of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health
A09 0980  3    Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis.
A09 0990  1       Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown
A09 0990  9    attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the
A09 1000  8    Montgomery County Court Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday
A09 1010  6    by Horace A. Davenport, counsel for the widow of the
A09 1020  6    man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car.
A09 1030  2       The petitions will be presented in open court to
A09 1030 11    President Judge William F. Dannehower, Davenport said.
A09 1040  7       Barnard, who pleaded no defense to manslaughter
A09 1050  7    and hit-run charges, was fined $500 by Judge Warren
A09 1060  6    K. Hess, and placed on two years' probation providing
A09 1070  2    he does not drive during that time. He was caught driving
A09 1080  2    the day after the sentence was pronounced and given
A09 1080 11    a warning.
A09 1090  1       Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery,
A09 1090  9    39. His widow started the circulation of petitions
A09 1100  7    after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation.
A09 1120  1       The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved
A09 1120  8    agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment
A09 1130  7    Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000
A09 1140  6    Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.
A09 1150  1       The commission also approved a novel plan that would
A09 1150 10    eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.
A09 1160  8       One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick
A09 1170  8    Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865.
A09 1180  5    The tract is bounded by Island ave., Dicks ave., 61st
A09 1190  4    st., and Eastwick ave.
A09 1190  8    #FOUR PARKS PLANNED#
A09 1200  1    It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment
A09 1210  1    Authority's master plan and will feature row houses,
A09 1210  9    garden apartments, four small parks, schools, churches,
A09 1220  6    a shopping center and several small clusters of stores.
A09 1230  5       The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal
A09 1240  3    Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm, a Philadelphia
A09 1250  4    builder, for work in the project.
A09 1250 10       The second agreement permits the authority to sell
A09 1260  7    a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia
A09 1270  6    Builders Eastwick Corp., a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia
A09 1280  7    area builders, which is interested in developing part
A09 1290  4    of the project.
A09 1290  7    #WOULD BAR VEHICLES#
A09 1290 10    The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians
A09 1300  7    was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis, former
A09 1310  5    Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting
A09 1320  6    planner for the New Eastwick Corp.
A09 1330  1       The plan calls for dividing the project into 16
A09 1330 10    sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic.
A09 1340  6    It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and
A09 1350  3    a central esplanade that would eventually run through
A09 1360  1    the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length
A09 1360 12    of the project.
A09 1370  1       The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave., which on
A09 1370  8    original plans ran through the center of the development.
A09 1380  9    The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over
A09 1390  5    roads in the project.
A09 1400  1    _KANSAS CITY, MO., FEB. 9 (UPI)_
A09 1400  7       - The president of the Kansas City local of the
A09 1410  6    International Association of Fire Fighters was severly
A09 1420  3    injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he
A09 1420 14    left home for work.
A09 1430  4       Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden, 42, the central
A09 1440  3    figure in a representation dispute between the fire
A09 1440 11    fighters association and the teamsters union, suffered
A09 1450  7    multiple fractures of both ankles. He was in Baptist
A09 1460  8    Memorial hospital.
A09 1460 10    #IGNITION SETS OFF BLAST#
A09 1470  3    The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his
A09 1480  1    1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway
A09 1480 10    of his home so that he could take his other car to
A09 1490  8    work.
A09 1490  9       "I'd just turned on the ignition when there was
A09 1500  6    a big flash and I was lying on the driveway", he said.
A09 1510  3       Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John, 17, and
A09 1520  3    Jim, 13, were inside the house. The younger boy said
A09 1520 13    the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall.
A09 1530 10    #HOOD FLIES OVER HOUSE#
A09 1540  1    The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over
A09 1540 11    the roof of the house. The left front wheel landed
A09 1550  8    100 feet away.
A09 1550 11       Police laboratory technicians said the explosive
A09 1560  6    device, containing either TNT or nitroglycerine, was
A09 1570  4    apparently placed under the left front wheel. It was
A09 1580  4    first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.
A09 1590  1       Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone
A09 1590  9    calls in recent months and reportedly received one
A09 1600  8    last night.
A09 1600 10       The fire department here has been torn for months
A09 1610  9    by dissension involving top personnel and the fight
A09 1630  1    between the fire fighters association and the teamsters
A09 1640  2    union.
A09 1640  3    #LED FIGHT ON TEAMSTERS#
A09 1640  7    Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present
A09 1650  6    city administration and led his union's battle against
A09 1660  3    the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen
A09 1670  1    in 1959.
A09 1670  3       The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000
A09 1670 11    reward for information leading to the arrest of the
A09 1680  9    person or persons responsible for the bombing. A $500
A09 1690  6    reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas
A09 1700  4    City, Kas.
A09 1700  6       The association said it would post 24 hour guards
A09 1710  7    at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and
A09 1720  3    Eugene Shiflett. Mining is secretary-treasurer of the
A09 1730  1    local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee.
A09 1730 11    Both have been active in the association.
A09 1750  1    _ANKARA, TURKEY, OCT. 24 (AP)_
A09 1750  6       - Turkish political leaders bowed today to military
A09 1760  5    pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front
A09 1770  2    government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president.
A09 1780  1       An agreement between the leaders of four parties
A09 1780  9    which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was
A09 1790  6    reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining
A09 1800  2    under the threat of an army coup d'etat.
A09 1810  1       By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey
A09 1810  8    since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months
A09 1820  7    ago, the army general staff, led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay,
A09 1830  6    had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national
A09 1840  5    coalition government.
A09 1840  7       The army leaders threatened to form a new military
A09 1850  6    government if the parties failed to sign an eight point
A09 1860  4    protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president. Gen.
A09 1870  1    Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.
A09 1880  1       The military also had demanded pledges that there
A09 1880  8    would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta
A09 1890  8    and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison
A09 1900  4    would be pardoned.
A09 1900  7       Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently
A09 1910  5    satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been
A09 1920  3    reached on a solution to the crisis created by the
A09 1920 13    elections which left no party with enough strength
A09 1930  8    to form a government on its own.
