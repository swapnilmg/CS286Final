D14 0010  1       TO WHAT extent and in what ways did Christianity
D14 0010 10    affect the United States of America in the nineteenth
D14 0020  9    century? How far and in what fashion did it modify
D14 0030  8    the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the
D14 0040  6    forces shaping the revolutionary age? To what extent
D14 0050  2    did it mould the morals and the social, economic, and
D14 0050 12    political life and institutions of the country?
D14 0060  7       A complete picture is impossible- partly because
D14 0070  3    of the limitations of space, partly because for millions
D14 0080  3    of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian
D14 0090  1    faith data are unobtainable. Even more of an obstacle
D14 0090 10    is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity
D14 0100  7    from other factors.
D14 0110  1       Although a complete picture cannot be given, we
D14 0110  9    can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian
D14 0120  9    faith entered as at least one creative factor. At times
D14 0130  7    we can say that it was the major factor.
D14 0140  2       What in some ways was the most important aspect
D14 0140 11    was the impact individually on the millions who constituted
D14 0150  8    the nation. As we have seen, a growing proportion,
D14 0160  7    although in 1914 still a minority, were members of
D14 0170  4    churches. Presumably those who did not have a formal
D14 0180  1    church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity
D14 0180 10    to a greater or less extent. Many of them had once
D14 0190  9    been members of a church or at least had been given
D14 0200  7    instruction in Christianity but for one or another
D14 0210  2    reason had allowed the connexion to lapse. The form
D14 0210 11    of Christianity to which they were exposed was for
D14 0220  8    some the Protestantism of the older stock, for others
D14 0230  6    the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration;
D14 0240  2    for still others, mostly of the nineteenth-century
D14 0250  1    immigration, it was Roman Catholicism, and for a small
D14 0250 10    minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy. Upon all of them
D14 0260  7    played the intellectual, social, political, and economic
D14 0270  4    attitudes, institutions, and customs of the nation.
D14 0280  2    Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress
D14 0280 11    and through them had had a share in making the individual
D14 0290 10    what he was. Yet to determine precisely to what extent
D14 0300  7    and exactly in what ways any individual showed the
D14 0310  3    effects of Christianity would be impossible. At best
D14 0320  2    only an approximation could be arrived at. To generalize
D14 0320 11    for the entire nation would be absurd. For instance,
D14 0330  8    we cannot know whether even for church members the
D14 0340  6    degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality
D14 0350  3    increased or declined as the proportion of church members
D14 0360  1    in the population rose. The temptation is to say that,
D14 0360 11    as the percentage of church members mounted, the degree
D14 0370  7    of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and
D14 0380  6    the trend was towards conformity to the general level.
D14 0390  2    Yet this cannot be proved. We know that in the early
D14 0390 13    part of the century many Protestant congregations took
D14 0400  8    positive action against members who transgressed the
D14 0410  6    ethical codes to which the majority subscribed. Thus
D14 0420  3    Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of
D14 0430  2    charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting,
D14 0430  9    malicious gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities,
D14 0440  6    gambling, horse racing, and failure to pay just debts.
D14 0450  7    If guilty, the offender might be excluded from membership.
D14 0460  3    As church membership burgeoned, such measures faded
D14 0470  2    into desuetude. But whether this was accompanied by
D14 0470 10    a general lowering of the moral life of the membership
D14 0480  9    we do not know.
D14 0480 13       What we can attempt with some hope of dependable
D14 0490  9    conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity
D14 0500  7    entered into particular aspects of the life of the
D14 0510  6    nation. We have already hinted at the fashion in which
D14 0520  2    Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual
D14 0520 10    life. We will now speak of the ways in which it helped
D14 0530 12    shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in
D14 0540  9    which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals
D14 0550  3    through reform movements, through programmes for bringing
D14 0560  1    the collective life to the nation to conformity to
D14 0560 10    Christian standards, and through leaders in the government.
D14 0570  7       Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted
D14 0580  5    its influence on American society as a whole primarily
D14 0590  6    through the Protestantism of the older stock. By the
D14 0600  3    end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning
D14 0610  1    to make itself felt, mainly through such institutions
D14 0610  9    as hospitals but also through its attitude towards
D14 0620  7    organized labour. In the twentieth century its influence
D14 0630  4    grew, as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century
D14 0640  4    immigration.
D14 0640  5    #THE AMERICAN DREAM#
D14 0640  8    The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the
D14 0650  9    Protestantism of the older stock. Thus "America", the
D14 0660  6    most widely sung of the patriotic songs, was written
D14 0670  4    by a New England Baptist clergyman, Samuel Francis
D14 0680  1    Smith (1808-1895), while a student in Andover Theological
D14 0690  1    Seminary. With its zeal for liberty and its dependence
D14 0690 10    on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished
D14 0700  8    on the Evangelical revivals. The great seal of the
D14 0710  6    United States was obviously inspired by the Christian
D14 0720  3    faith. Here was what was called the American dream,
D14 0720 12    namely, the effort to build a structure which would
D14 0730  9    be something new in history and to do so in such fashion
D14 0740  9    that God could bless it. Later in the century the dream
D14 0750  6    again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee
D14 0760  2    Bates (1859-1929), daughter and granddaughter of New
D14 0760 10    England Congregational ministers, in her widely sung
D14 0770  7    hymn, written in 1893, "America the Beautiful", with
D14 0780  6    the words "O beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern
D14 0790  6    impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat
D14 0800  2    across the wilderness. America, America, God mend thy
D14 0810  2    every flaw, confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty
D14 0810 12    in law ... O beautiful for patriot dream that sees
D14 0820  9    beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed
D14 0830  5    by human tears. America, America, God shed His grace
D14 0840  5    on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea
D14 0850  2    to shining sea".
D14 0850  5       The American dream was compounded of many strains.
D14 0860  3    Some were clearly of Christian origin, among them the
D14 0870  1    Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to
D14 0870  9    make Christian liberty, Christian equality, and Christian
D14 0880  6    fraternity the passion of the land. Some have seen
D14 0890  6    revivalism and the search for Christian perfection
D14 0900  1    as the fountain-head of the American hope. Here, too,
D14 0900 11    must be placed Unitarianism and, less obviously from
D14 0910  8    Christian inspiration, Emerson, Transcendentalism,
D14 0920  3    and the idealism of Walt Whitman. We must also remember
D14 0930  4    those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth-
D14 0940  1    among them Melville, Hawthorne, and Henry James the
D14 0940  9    elder, all of them out of a Christian background.
D14 0950  9    #REFORM MOVEMENTS#
D14 0950 11    With such a dream arising, at least in part, from the
D14 0960 11    Protestant heritage of the United States and built
D14 0970  7    into the foundations of the nation, it is not surprising
D14 0980  5    that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression.
D14 0990  2    A number were in the nature of movements to relieve
D14 0990 12    or remove social ills.
D14 1000  4       Significantly, the initiation and leadership of
D14 1010  2    a major proportion of the reform movements, especially
D14 1010 10    those in the first half of the nineteenth century,
D14 1020  8    came from men and women of New England birth or parentage
D14 1030  6    and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism.
D14 1040  2    Several of the movements were given a marked impetus
D14 1050  2    by revivalism. Quakers, some from New England, had
D14 1050 10    a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength
D14 1060  7    would have warranted. We do well to remind ourselves
D14 1070  7    that from men and women of New England ancestry also
D14 1080  3    issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
D14 1090  3    the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the
D14 1100  1    American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
D14 1100  8    the American Home Missionary Society, the American
D14 1110  6    Bible Society, and New England theology. The atmosphere
D14 1120  5    was one of optimism, of confidence in human progress,
D14 1130  4    and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.
D14 1140  1    The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence,
D14 1140  6    although holding to original sin and the doctrine of
D14 1150  8    election, inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours
D14 1160  4    for others, looked for the early coming of the Millennium,
D14 1170  2    and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability
D14 1180  1    cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.
D14 1180  9       We should recall the number of movements for the
D14 1190 10    service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism
D14 1200  7    of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent
D14 1210  7    of Europe- among them prison reform, anti-slavery measures,
D14 1220  5    legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour,
D14 1230  3    the Inner Mission, and the Red Cross.
D14 1230 10       We cannot take the space to record all the efforts
D14 1240 10    for the removal or alleviation of collective ills.
D14 1250  4    A few of the more prominent must serve as examples
D14 1260  3    of what a complete listing and description would disclose.
D14 1270  1    Several were born in the early decades and persisted
D14 1270 10    throughout the century. Others were ephemeral. Some
D14 1280  6    disappeared with the attainment of their purpose. Still
D14 1290  5    others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions
D14 1300  2    which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary
D14 1300 10    age.
D14 1310  1    #THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT#
D14 1310  4    The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815
D14 1320  3    and mounted after that year until, as a result of the
D14 1320 14    Civil War, emancipation was achieved.
D14 1330  5       Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading
D14 1340  4    some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly.
D14 1350  2    For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting
D14 1360  1    of Friends declared that its members should emancipate
D14 1360  9    their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from
D14 1370  9    membership all who did not comply. In the latter year
D14 1380  6    Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian strain of
D14 1390  3    New England theology took its name, asked the Continental
D14 1400  1    Congress to abolish slavery. As we have seen, Methodism
D14 1400 10    early took a stand against slavery. Beginning at least
D14 1410  8    as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned
D14 1420  4    slavery.
D14 1420  5       After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted, chiefly
D14 1430  4    among Protestants and those of Protestant background
D14 1440  2    of the older stock. The nineteenth-century immigration,
D14 1450  1    whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much
D14 1450 10    concerned, for very few if any among them held slaves:
D14 1460 10    they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery
D14 1470  5    had disappeared or was on the way out, or were too
D14 1480  4    poverty-stricken to own slaves.
D14 1480  9       The anti-slavery movement took many forms. Benjamin
D14 1490  5    Lundy (1789-1839), a Quaker, was a pioneer in preparing
D14 1500  5    the way for anti-slavery societies. It was he who turned
D14 1510  4    the attention of William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879)
D14 1520  1    to the subject. Garrison, Massachusetts born of Nova
D14 1520  9    Scotian parentage, was by temperament and conviction
D14 1530  6    a reformer. Chiefly remembered because of his incessant
D14 1540  5    advocacy of "immediate and unconditional abolition",
D14 1550  2    he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among
D14 1560  1    them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the
D14 1560  9    Indians. Incurably optimistic, dogmatic, and utterly
D14 1570  5    fearless, in his youth a devout Baptist, in spite of
D14 1580  5    his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier
D14 1590  3    (1807-1892) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches
D14 1600  2    for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the
D14 1600 11    slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was
D14 1610  9    emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration
D14 1620  6    of the Bible.
D14 1620  9       A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement
D14 1630  8    through the Finney revivals. Finney himself, while
D14 1640  4    opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis on evangelism,
D14 1650  3    but from his converts issued much of the leadership
D14 1650 12    of the anti-slavery campaign. Theodore Dwight Weld
D14 1660  8    (1803-1895) was especially active. Weld was the son
D14 1670  7    and grandson of New England Congregational ministers.
D14 1680  2    As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists
D14 1690  3    and gave himself to winning young men. A strong temperance
D14 1700  1    advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher,
D14 1700  9    Charles Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted
D14 1710  7    himself to the anti-slavery cause. A group of young
D14 1720  6    men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological
D14 1730  1    Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery
D14 1740  1    position. The majority then went to the infant Oberlin.
D14 1740 10    They and others employed some of Finney's techniques
D14 1750  7    as they sought to win adherents to the cause. Weld
D14 1760  6    contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such
D14 1770  3    men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton, enlisted
D14 1780  2    John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay
D14 1790  1    Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. He shunned
D14 1800  1    publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.
D14 1800  9       Wendell Phillips (1811-1884), from a prominent Massachusetts
D14 1810  7    family, in his teens was converted under the preaching
D14 1820  6    of Lyman Beecher. Although he later broke with the
D14 1830  5    churches because he believed that they were insufficiently
D14 1840  1    outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout
D14 1840  9    Christian. He was remembered chiefly for his fearless
D14 1850  8    advocacy of abolition, but he also stood for equal
D14 1860  7    rights for women, for opportunity for the freedmen,
D14 1870  2    and for prohibition.
D14 1870  5       The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary
D14 1880  3    reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and
D14 1890  2    financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan (1786-1865)
D14 1890  9    and his younger brother, Lewis Tappan (1788-1873).
