N05 0010  1    She was carrying a quirt, and she started to raise
N05 0010 11    it, then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist.
N05 0020  7       "I saw your fire", she said, speaking slowly, making
N05 0030  5    an effort to control her anger. "You could burn down
N05 0040  4    this whole mountainside with a fire that size. It wouldn't
N05 0050  1    matter to a fool like you. It would to me".
N05 0050 11       "All right", Wilson said quickly. "The fire's too
N05 0060  8    big. And I appreciate the advice".
N05 0070  3       He was losing patience again. An hour before, with
N05 0080  3    the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness,
N05 0090  1    he would have appreciated company. She had helped him
N05 0090 10    change his mind.
N05 0100  1       "I'm not advising you", she said. "I'm telling you.
N05 0110  1    That fire's too big. Let it burn down. And make sure
N05 0110 12    it's out when you leave in the morning".
N05 0120  7       He was taken aback. It took him a long time to compose
N05 0130  8    himself.
N05 0130  9       "There's some mistake", he said finally. "You're
N05 0140  5    right about the fire. It's bigger than it has to be,
N05 0150  6    though I don't see where it's doing any harm. But you're
N05 0160  4    wrong about the rest of it. I'm not leaving in the
N05 0170  2    morning. Why should I? I own the place".
N05 0170 10       She showed her surprise by tightening the reins
N05 0180  7    and moving the gelding around so that she could get
N05 0190  5    a better look at his face. It didn't seem to tell her
N05 0200  2    anything. She glanced around the clearing, taking in
N05 0200 10    the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered
N05 0210  9    over the ground, the two kids, the whiteface bull that
N05 0220  7    was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of
N05 0230  4    the firelight. She studied it for a long time. Then
N05 0240  1    she turned back to Wilson and smiled, and he wasn't
N05 0240 11    quite sure what she meant by it.
N05 0250  3       "You own this place"? she said, and her tone had
N05 0260  2    softened until it was almost friendly. "You bought
N05 0260 10    it"?
N05 0270  1       "From a man in St. Louis", Wilson said. "Jake Carwood.
N05 0280  1    Maybe you know him".
N05 0280  5       The girl laughed. "I know him. I ought to. My father
N05 0290  6    ran him off here six years ago".
N05 0290 13       Wilson didn't say anything. He stood watching the
N05 0300  8    girl, wondering what was coming next. She had picked
N05 0310  7    up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and
N05 0320  4    smiling at him.
N05 0320  7       "Carwood didn't tell you that", she said.
N05 0330  4       "No", Wilson said. "But it's understandable. It's
N05 0340  2    not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of.
N05 0350  1    And it doesn't make any difference. He sold me a clear
N05 0350 12    title. I have it with me, right here. If you want to
N05 0360 11    see"-
N05 0360 12       "Never mind", she said sternly. "It wouldn't matter
N05 0370  8    to my father, and not to me. I meant what I said about
N05 0380 11    that fire. Be sure it's out when you leave. That's
N05 0390  6    all. I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now".
N05 0400  3       It was meant to insult him, and didn't quite succeed.
N05 0410  2    He took the reins just below the bit and held them
N05 0410 13    firmly, and it was his turn to smile now. "I don't
N05 0420 11    mind washing dishes now and then", he said pleasantly.
N05 0430  6    "It doesn't hurt. It might hurt you, though. Somebody
N05 0440  4    might mistake you for a woman".
N05 0450  1       He meant to say more, but he never got the chance.
N05 0450 12    She was quick. She brought the quirt down, slashing
N05 0460  7    it across his cheek, and he tried to step back. She
N05 0470  5    swung the quirt again, and this time he caught her
N05 0480  1    wrist and pulled her out of the saddle.
N05 0480  9       She came down against him, and he tried to break
N05 0490  7    her fall. He grabbed her by the shoulders and went
N05 0500  3    down on one knee, taking her weight so that some of
N05 0500 14    the wind was driven out of him. It made him a little
N05 0510 11    sick, and he let go of her. He got up slowly, and she
N05 0520  8    was already on her feet, and he stood facing her. He
N05 0530  4    wiped the blood from his cheek.
N05 0530 10       "I ought to"- he said. He was shaking with anger,
N05 0540 10    his breath coming in long, painful gasps. "That quirt-
N05 0550  5    I ought to use it on you, where it would do the most
N05 0560  4    good. If you were a man"-
N05 0560 10       "She isn't, mister".
N05 0570  2       The voice came from behind him, and Wilson turned.
N05 0580  1    The fire had gone down, and the man was only a shadow
N05 0580 13    against the trees. But a moment later he brought his
N05 0590  9    horse forward into the light, and Wilson had a good
N05 0600  6    look at him. He was tall and dark-skinned, a half-breed,
N05 0610  3    Wilson thought. And he was handsome, despite the long
N05 0610 12    thin scar that slanted across his cheek.
N05 0620  7       "She's not a man, mister", he said. "I am. If you've
N05 0630  8    got any ideas". He raised the Winchester and pointed
N05 0640  5    it at Wilson's chest.
N05 0640  9       "Put the rifle down, Joseph", the girl said. She
N05 0650  9    seemed irritated. "I thought I told you to stay home".
N05 0660  8       The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested
N05 0670  5    it across his lap. The scar looked pure white in the
N05 0680  4    half-darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set, and
N05 0680 14    expressionless. "You shouldn't be riding up here after
N05 0690  8    dark, Judith", he said quietly. "I can take care of
N05 0700  9    this. It's no job for you".
N05 0710  2       The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her
N05 0710 10    knee and glared at him. He took it without flinching.
N05 0720 10       "I said go home, Joseph. You've got no business
N05 0730  8    up here".
N05 0730 10       The half-breed didn't answer this time. But the
N05 0740  7    scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth,
N05 0750  7    and his eyes were hurt and angry. It made Wilson wonder.
N05 0760  3    He watched the half-breed as he turned silently. They
N05 0770  1    could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a
N05 0770 12    while, then the sound faded out.
N05 0780  4       Wilson brushed the dust from his coat. "Who was
N05 0790  2    that"? he asked. "Your personal guard? You're pretty
N05 0800  1    hard on him".
N05 0800  4       "He works for my father", the girl said, and then
N05 0810  3    seemed to change her mind. "He's a friend. His name's
N05 0820  1    Joseph Sanchez. Is there anything else you want to
N05 0820 10    know"?
N05 0830  1       "Not now", Wilson said. "I guess I'll find out soon
N05 0840  1    enough. You've got blood on your cheek. Not yours.
N05 0840 10    Mine. It must have got there when you fell against
N05 0850  8    me".
N05 0850  9       She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat.
N05 0860  7       "I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man
N05 0870  6    since you were a baby", Wilson said.
N05 0880  1       He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong
N05 0880 12    toward the handle of the quirt, and he grabbed her
N05 0890  8    wrist. "Oh, no", he said, and he was without humor
N05 0900  5    now. "I've had enough of that. I've had enough of you.
N05 0910  3    I don't know what goes on around here, and I don't
N05 0920  1    care. I don't know what makes you think you can get
N05 0920 12    away with this kind of business, and I don't care about
N05 0930  9    that, either. You took me by surprise. But I'll know
N05 0940  6    how to handle you next time".
N05 0950  1       She brought up her free hand to hit him, but this
N05 0950 12    time he was quicker. He side-stepped her blow and she
N05 0960  8    fell, stumbling against the gelding. She finally regained
N05 0970  4    her balance and got up in the saddle. Her hat had come
N05 0980  4    off and fallen behind her shoulders, held by the string,
N05 0990  1    and he could see her face more clearly than he had
N05 0990 12    at any time before. He had forgotten that she was so
N05 1000  8    pretty. But her prettiness was what he had noticed
N05 1010  4    first, and all the other things had come afterward:
N05 1020  1    cruelty, meanness, self-will. He had known women like
N05 1020 10    that, one woman in particular. And one had been too
N05 1030  8    many. He watched the girl until she had gone into the
N05 1040  6    trees, and waited until he couldn't hear the sound
N05 1050  2    of her horse any longer, then went up to where the
N05 1050 13    children were sleeping.
N05 1060  2       They weren't sleeping, of course, but they thought
N05 1070  1    they were doing him a favor by pretending. He hadn't
N05 1070 11    shown up too well in their eyes, letting himself be
N05 1080  8    browbeaten by a woman. They expected greater things
N05 1090  4    from him, regardless of how trying the circumstances,
N05 1100  1    and they were disappointed. And determined not to show
N05 1100 10    it. They lay a little too stiffly, with their eyes
N05 1110  9    straining to stay closed.
N05 1120  1       "Go to sleep", he said. "Both of you. There's better
N05 1130  1    things to do than listen to something like that. I'll
N05 1130 11    be down at the creek finishing the dishes, if you want
N05 1140  9    me".
N05 1140 10       He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried
N05 1160  9    it back down to the stream. The coyote was calling
N05 1170  5    again, and he hoped that this time there would be no
N05 1180  3    other sounds to interrupt it. Not tonight, at any rate.
N05 1180 13    He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble. If she
N05 1190 10    did, he could stand it better in the light.
N05 1200  6       He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected
N05 1210  3    on how things had turned out. That afternoon when they
N05 1220  1    had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house,
N05 1220 12    his hopes had been high. Already some of the pain had
N05 1230  9    gone from Amelia's death. Not all of it. There would
N05 1240  7    still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and
N05 1250  3    guilty relief. But they were starting a new life. And
N05 1250 13    they had almost everything they needed: land, a house,
N05 1260  9    two whiteface bulls, three horses.
N05 1270  4       The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it. Six
N05 1280  4    hundred and forty acres, the old man back in St. Louis
N05 1290  1    had said; good grass, good water. Well, the grass was
N05 1290 11    there, though in some places the ground was too steep
N05 1300  9    for a cow to get to it. The water was there, so much
N05 1310  6    of it that it spread all through the dead orchard.
N05 1320  4    And there was a house; livable perhaps, but badly in
N05 1330  3    need of repairs.
N05 1330  6       In the last analysis, though, Wilson had little
N05 1340  3    cause to complain. The place had been cheap- just the
N05 1350  1    little he had left after Amelia's burial- and it would
N05 1350 11    serve its purpose. There was only one place where Jake
N05 1360  9    Carwood's description had gone badly awry: the peace
N05 1370  7    and quiet. It hadn't started out that way. And he had
N05 1380  6    a feeling- thanks to the girl- that things would get
N05 1390  3    worse before they got better.
N05 1390  8    #2#
N05 1390  9    They had the house cleaned up by noon, and Wilson sent
N05 1400  7    the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses. He
N05 1410  2    stood on the porch and watched him struggling with
N05 1420  1    the heavy harness, and finally went over to help him.
N05 1420 11    Kathy was already in the wagon. They were going to
N05 1430  8    town, and they were both excited.
N05 1440  1       Wilson backed the team into the traces, and wished
N05 1440 10    they weren't going to town at all. He had an uneasy
N05 1450 10    feeling about it. That girl last night, what was her
N05 1460  6    name? Judith Pierce. It was the only thing about her
N05 1470  4    that was the least bit hard to remember.
N05 1470 12       He finished with the team and filled his pipe and
N05 1480  9    stood looking about him. He had spent two hours riding
N05 1490  7    around the ranch that morning, and in broad daylight
N05 1500  3    it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made
N05 1510  1    it seem. There was brush, and stands of pine that no
N05 1510 12    grass could grow under, and places so steep that cattle
N05 1520  8    wouldn't stop to graze. But there was water. There
N05 1530  5    was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first
N05 1540  3    stand of trees, fed by a half dozen springs that popped
N05 1540 14    out of the ground above the hillside orchard. Yes,
N05 1550  9    there was plenty of water, too much, and that was probably
N05 1560  7    the trouble. There were tracks of cattle all over his
N05 1570  6    six hundred and forty acres.
N05 1570 11       The first part of the road was steep, but it leveled
N05 1580 10    off after the second bend and curled gradually into
N05 1590  4    the valley. It was hotter once they reached the flat,
N05 1600  3    and drier, but the grass was better. A warm breeze
N05 1600 13    played across it, moving it like waves. A red-tailed
N05 1610  9    hawk flew in behind them and stayed there, watching
N05 1620  5    for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from
N05 1630  4    the side of the road. It took them an hour before they
N05 1630 16    came to the first houses of Kelseyville.
N05 1640  7       The town was about what Wilson expected: one main
N05 1650  5    street with its rows of false-fronted buildings, a
N05 1660  3    water tower, a few warehouses, a single hotel; all
N05 1660 12    dusty and sunbaked. The place was quiet.
