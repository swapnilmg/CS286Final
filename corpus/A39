A39 0010  1       When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees'
A39 0010  9    man of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the
A39 0020 11    bleachers, his feat touches upon the sublime. When
A39 0030  5    Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular teammate, powers
A39 0040  3    four home runs in a double-header, his performance
A39 0050  1    merits awe. But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory
A39 0050 10    Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels, who once caught
A39 0060  7    three straight fly balls in center field because, as
A39 0070  4    a teammate explained, "the other team thought no one
A39 0080  3    was out there", hits seven home runs in four months
A39 0080 13    (three more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960),
A39 0090 10    his achievement borders on the ridiculous. This is
A39 0100  6    Baseball 1961. This is the year home runs ranged from
A39 0110  3    the sublime to the ridiculous.
A39 0110  8       It is the year when (1) amiable Jim Gentile of the
A39 0120  7    Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive
A39 0130  4    innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented
A39 0140  1    style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs;
A39 0140  8    (2) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed
A39 0150  7    a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to
A39 0160  6    stroke four home runs in a game; (3) the Milwaukee
A39 0170  2    Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home
A39 0170 11    runs in three games and lost two of them; and (4) catcher
A39 0180 12    Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a
A39 0190  8    record with home runs in four successive times at bat,
A39 0200  5    two of them as a pinch-hitter.
A39 0200 12       Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats,
A39 0210  8    the shrinking strike zone, and the fact that the knock-down
A39 0220  9    pitch is now illegal. Experts point to the thinning
A39 0230  5    of pitching talent in the American League caused by
A39 0240  2    expansion. Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has
A39 0240 11    a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon
A39 0250  6    the bureau of baseball records, home-run division.
A39 0260  4       Of all the records in peril, one stands apart, dramatic
A39 0270  3    in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now,
A39 0280  1    doubly dramatic in its jeopardy. This, of course, is
A39 0280 10    baseball's most remarkable mark: The 60 home runs hit
A39 0290  8    in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure, the incredible
A39 0300  4    athlete, George Herman (Babe) Ruth of the Yankees.
A39 0310  2       Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious
A39 0320  1    runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been
A39 0320 12    thwarted. What ultimately frustrated every challenger
A39 0330  6    was Ruth's amazing September surge. In the final month
A39 0340  6    of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen home runs, a closing
A39 0350  5    spurt never matched.
A39 0350  8    #DOUBLE THREAT:#
A39 0355  1    Always, in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record,
A39 0360  8    one man alone- a Jimmy Foxx (58 in 1932) or a Hank
A39 0370  9    Greenberg (58 in 1938) or a Hack Wilson (56 in 1930)-
A39 0380  5    made the bid. But now, for the first time since Lou
A39 0390  3    Gehrig (with 47 home runs) spurred Ruth on in 1927,
A39 0390 13    two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on
A39 0400 10    60. Their names are Mantle and Maris, their team is
A39 0410  6    the Yankees, and their threat is real.
A39 0420  1       After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs.
A39 0420 11    After 108 games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger
A39 0430  9    Maris 41. Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces
A39 0440  5    over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games, and, mathematically,
A39 0450  4    each will hit more than 60 home runs. This is the great
A39 0460  2    edge the two Yankees have going for them. To better
A39 0460 12    Ruth's mark, neither needs a spectacular September
A39 0470  7    flourish. All Mantle needs is eight more home runs
A39 0480  7    in August and ten in September, and he will establish
A39 0490  5    a new record. In Ruth's day- and until this year- the
A39 0500  2    schedule was 154 games. Baseball commissioner Ford
A39 0500  9    Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official
A39 0510  9    unless it is broken in 154 games.)
A39 0520  5       "Even on the basis of 154 games, this is the ideal
A39 0530  4    situation", insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president
A39 0540  1    of the Chicago White Sox. "It has to be easier with
A39 0540 12    two of them. How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle"?
A39 0550 10    #ROOMMATES:#
A39 0560  1    Neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict
A39 0560  8    60 home runs for himself. Although both concede they
A39 0570  7    would like to hit 60, they stick primarily to the baseball
A39 0580  6    player's standard quote: "The important thing is to
A39 0590  5    win the pennant". But one thing is for certain: There
A39 0600  2    is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's
A39 0610  1    Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the
A39 0610 11    MVP in 1960. Each enjoys seeing the other hit home
A39 0620 10    runs ("I hope Roger hits 80", Mantle says), and each
A39 0630  7    enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ("and
A39 0640  5    I hope I hit 81").
A39 0640 10       The sluggers get along so well in fact, that with
A39 0650  8    their families at home for the summer (Mantle's in
A39 0660  3    Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming together.
A39 0670  2    Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder,
A39 0670 10    share an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far
A39 0680  9    from New York International Airport. The three pay
A39 0690  6    $251 a month for four rooms (kitchen, dining room,
A39 0700  3    living room, and bedroom), with air-conditioning and
A39 0710  2    new modern furniture. Mantle and Cerv use the twin
A39 0710 11    beds in the bedroom; Maris sleeps on a green studio
A39 0720  7    couch in the living room. They divide up the household
A39 0730  5    chores: Cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast and
A39 0740  2    sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies
A39 0740  9    the transportation (a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible),
A39 0750  7    and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment
A39 0760  8    house to Yankee Stadium. Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably
A39 0770  6    share one major-league record already: Among them,
A39 0780  3    they have fifteen children- eight for Cerv, four for
A39 0790  2    Mantle, and three for Maris.
A39 0790  7       As roommates, teammates, and home-run mates, Mantle,
A39 0800  6    29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago, and
A39 0810  3    Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City
A39 0820  1    two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds.
A39 0820  8    Both were scholastic stars in football, basketball,
A39 0830  5    and baseball (Mantle in Commerce, Okla., Maris in Fargo,
A39 0840  5    N.D.); as halfbacks, both came close to playing football
A39 0850  4    at the University of Oklahoma ("Sometimes in the minors",
A39 0860  4    Maris recalls, "I wished I had gone to Oklahoma").
A39 0870  1       To an extent, the two even look alike. Both have
A39 0870 11    blue eyes and short blond hair. Both are 6 feet tall
A39 0880 11    and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly
A39 0890  7    muscular (he has a 17-1/2-inch neck), looks bigger.
A39 0900  4    With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders,
A39 0910  1    both must have their clothes made to order. Maris purchases
A39 0910 11    $100 suits from Simpson's in New York. Mantle, more
A39 0920  9    concerned with dress, buys his suits four at a time
A39 0930  9    at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250
A39 0940  6    each.
A39 0940  7    #LIGHT READING:#
A39 0940  9    Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified
A39 0950  6    an intellectual, but lately Mantle has shown unusual
A39 0960  4    devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's "Tropic
A39 0970  2    of Cancer". Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate
A39 0980  1    literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by
A39 0980  9    reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips.
A39 0990  6       Mantle is not normally given to public speaking-
A39 1000  5    or, for that matter, to private speaking. "What do
A39 1010  3    you and Mickey talk about at home"? a reporter asked
A39 1020  1    Maris recently.
A39 1020  3       "To tell you the truth", Maris said, "Mickey don't
A39 1030  2    talk much".
A39 1030  4       This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer. What
A39 1040  4    is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris,
A39 1050  1    under constant pressure from writers and photographers,
A39 1050  8    are trying to be cooperative.
A39 1060  4       Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less outgoing,
A39 1070  2    Maris the more outspoken. But last week, when a reporter
A39 1080  1    was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up
A39 1080  9    and volunteered an anecdote. "See that kid"? he said,
A39 1090  8    pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy. "That's
A39 1100  6    [Yogi] Berra's. I'll never forget one time I struck
A39 1110  6    out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we lost the
A39 1120  3    game. I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real
A39 1120 13    low, and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says:
A39 1130 12    'You stunk'".
A39 1140  1       Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer
A39 1140  9    all questions candidly and fully, but on rare occasions,
A39 1150  8    he shuns newsmen. "When I've made a dumb play", he
A39 1160  7    says, "I don't want to talk to anyone. I'm angry".
A39 1170  4       By his own confession, Maris is an angry young man.
A39 1180  4    Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer:
A39 1190  1    "I can't play for you. Send me where I can play". (Meyer
A39 1200  1    sent him to Reading, Pa.) Benched at Indianapolis
A39 1200  9    in 1956, he told manager Kerby Farrell: "I'm not learning
A39 1210  9    anything on the bench. Play me". (Farrell did- and
A39 1220  8    Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series.)
A39 1230  6    "That's the way I am", he says. "I tell people what
A39 1240  7    I think. If you're a good ballplayer, you've got to
A39 1250  4    get mad. Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll
A39 1260  1    give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you
A39 1260 12    nine out of ten times".
A39 1270  3    #IDOLS' IDOLS:#
A39 1270  5    One good indication of the two men's personalities
A39 1280  3    is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.
A39 1290  1    Maris's was Ted Williams. "When I was a kid", Maris
A39 1300  1    told a sportswriter last week, "I used to follow Williams
A39 1300 11    every day in the box score, just to see whether he
A39 1310 10    got a hit or not".
A39 1320  1       "When you came up to the majors, did you seek out
A39 1320 12    Williams for advice"?
A39 1330  1       "Are you kidding"? said Maris. "You're afraid to
A39 1340  3    talk to a guy you idolize".
A39 1340  9       Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio. "When Mickey went
A39 1350  5    to the Yankees", says Mark Freeman, an ex-Yankee pitcher
A39 1360  5    who sells mutual funds in Denver, "DiMaggio still was
A39 1370  3    playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker,
A39 1380  1    just aching for some word of encouragement from this
A39 1380 10    great man, this hero of his. But DiMaggio never said
A39 1390  8    a word. It crushed Mickey. He told me he vowed right
A39 1400  7    then that if he ever got to be a star, this never would
A39 1410  3    be said of him". Mantle has kept the vow. Among all
A39 1420  1    the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.
A39 1420 11       Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball
A39 1430  9    above all else. If laying ties on a railroad track,
A39 1440  8    which he once did for $1 an hour, paid more than playing
A39 1450  5    right field for the Yankees, Maris would lay ties on
A39 1460  4    a railroad track. If working in a zinc mine, which
A39 1460 14    he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than
A39 1470 11    playing center field for the Yankees, Mantle would
A39 1480  5    work in a zinc mine. But since railroading and mining
A39 1490  3    are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate
A39 1500  1    on baseball. They try to play baseball the best they
A39 1500 11    can.
A39 1510  1       Each is a complete ballplayer. Mantle, beyond any
A39 1510  9    question, can do more things well. ("One of the reasons
A39 1520  9    they get along fine", says a sportswriter who is friendly
A39 1530  7    with the two men, "is that both realize Mantle is
A39 1540  4    head-and-shoulders
A39 1540  7    above Maris".) Hitting, Mantle has an immediate advantage
A39 1560  5    because he bats both left-handed and right-handed,
A39 1570  1    Maris only left-handed. They both possess near classic
A39 1575  1    stances, dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings.
A39 1580 10    Mantle is considerably better hitting for average (.332,
A39 1590  6    fourth in the league, to .280 for Maris so far this
A39 1600  6    year).
A39 1600  7       Both are good bunters: Maris once beat out eighteen
A39 1610  5    of nineteen in the minor leagues; Mantle is a master
A39 1620  4    at dragging a bunt toward first base. Both have brilliant
A39 1630  1    speed: Mantle was timed from home plate (batting left-handed)
A39 1630 11    to first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other
A39 1640 10    major leaguer; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds
A39 1650  9    in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio,
A39 1660  5    the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox.
A39 1670  3    Both are good, daring fielders: Mantle covers more
A39 1680  1    ground; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.
A39 1680  7       Yet with all their skills, the appeal of Mantle
A39 1690  6    and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic: The home
A39 1700  4    run. With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees may
A39 1710  2    have saved baseball from its dullest season. (American
A39 1710 10    League expansion created, inevitably, weaker teams.
A39 1720  5    Only two teams in each league [the Yankees and Detroit,
A39 1730  5    the Dodgers and Cincinnati] are battling for first
A39 1740  3    place.
A39 1740  4       Appropriately, the emphasis on the home run, at
A39 1750  3    a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest
A39 1750 13    moment. In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919
A39 1760 10    White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked
A39 1770  7    out, fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball.
A39 1780  5    Something was needed to revive interest; the something
A39 1790  3    was the home run.
