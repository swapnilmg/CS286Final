R04 0010  1       Up to date, however, his garden was still more or
R04 0010 11    less of a mess, he hadn't even started his workshop
R04 0020  7    and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood
R04 0030  4    he hadn't found it.
R04 0030  8       It wasn't his fault that these things were so. The
R04 0040  7    difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its
R04 0050  4    quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately.
R04 0060  1       As a result, life had become a kind of continuous
R04 0060 11    make-ready. Once he disposed of these items which screamed
R04 0070  9    so harshly for attention, he could undertake the things
R04 0080  6    which really counted. Then, at last, his day would
R04 0090  4    fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to
R04 0100  1    read, or garden or just wander through the woods in
R04 0100 11    the late afternoon, accompanied by his dogs.
R04 0110  5       His dogs? He had almost forgotten them, although
R04 0120  3    they had played such an important part in his early
R04 0130  1    dreams. Then they had always been romping around him
R04 0130 10    on these walks, yelping with delight, dashing off into
R04 0140  7    the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions, returning
R04 0150  3    to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws. Dogs
R04 0160  2    did something to one's ego. They were constantly assuring
R04 0170  1    you that you were one of the world's great guys. Regardless
R04 0170 12    of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be, you
R04 0180 11    could be certain they would never find out- and even
R04 0190  6    if they did it would make no difference.
R04 0200  1       Now it became increasingly apparent that there were
R04 0200  9    to be no dogs in the picture. What in the world were
R04 0210  9    you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for
R04 0220  7    town on Monday afternoons? You certainly couldn't take
R04 0230  3    them into the little apartment and if you tried to
R04 0230 13    farm them out for two or three days every week they
R04 0240 11    would become so confused that they would have nervous
R04 0250  6    breakdowns. Why in the world couldn't he live in one
R04 0260  5    place the way everyone else seemed to?
R04 0270  1       It worried him, this inability to get the simplest
R04 0280  9    things done in the course of a day. He would wake up
R04 0290  8    in the middle of the night and fret about it. How in
R04 0300  4    the world had he formerly found time to build up a
R04 0300 15    business, raise a family, be on half a dozen boards,
R04 0310 10    work actively on committees and either go out in the
R04 0320  7    evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief
R04 0330  5    case?
R04 0330  6       Was it possible that as people grow older the nature
R04 0340  4    of time changed? Could it be that it speeded up for
R04 0350  1    the aged in some mysterious way, as if a bored universe
R04 0350 12    were skipping through the end of the chapter just to
R04 0360  9    get it over with? Or was the answer less metaphysical?
R04 0370  5    Did older people work more slowly? Did it take a man
R04 0380  6    of sixty-five longer to write a letter, shave, clean
R04 0390  1    out a barn, read a newspaper, than a man of thirty?
R04 0390 12    Did men become perfectionists as they grew older, polishing,
R04 0400  7    polishing, reluctant to let go?
R04 0410  3       It might be that certain people were born with a
R04 0410 13    compulsion to complicate their lives, while others
R04 0420  7    could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely,
R04 0430  4    like lizards in the sun, too indolent to blink their
R04 0440  4    eyes. Perhaps it was his misfortune, or good fortune,
R04 0450  1    whichever way one looked at it, to belong to the former
R04 0450 12    group, and he was struggling unconsciously to build
R04 0460  6    up pressure in a world which demanded none, which was
R04 0470  4    positively antagonistic to it.
R04 0470  8       And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't
R04 0480  8    find time to do any of the things he had planned to
R04 0490  6    do after retirement: reading, roaming, gardening, lying
R04 0500  2    on his back and watching the clouds go by, was because
R04 0510  1    he didn't want to do them. There was no compulsion
R04 0510 11    behind them. They could be done or left undone and
R04 0520  8    nobody really gave a damn. During all his busy life
R04 0530  5    he had only done things which had to be done. This
R04 0540  1    habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed
R04 0540 12    futile to do anything for which no one was waiting.
R04 0550  8       He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch.
R04 0560  6    It was five minutes after four. On some distant farm
R04 0570  3    a rooster crowed and, far down the valley, an associate
R04 0570 13    answered. He turned over impatiently and pulled the
R04 0580  8    sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment
R04 0590  5    of the dawn.
R04 0590  8    #24#
R04 0590  9    AT LEAST HE COULD BUY THE equipment for his workshop.
R04 0600  9    Thus committed, action might follow. He went down to
R04 0610  7    Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store and bought a full
R04 0620  5    set of carpenter's tools, including a rotary power
R04 0630  2    saw and several other pieces of power machinery that
R04 0630 11    Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling,
R04 0640  8    whatever they were. He also bought a huge square of
R04 0650  9    pegboard for hanging up his tools, and lumber for his
R04 0660  5    workbench, sandpaper and glue and assorted nails, levels
R04 0670  2    and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets
R04 0670 11    that he had no idea how to use or what they were for.
R04 0680 11       "There", said Mr. Mills. "That'll get you started.
R04 0690  7    Best not to get everything at once. Add things as you
R04 0700  7    find you need 'em".
R04 0700 11       He didn't even ask the cost of this collection.
R04 0710  8    After all, if you were going to set up a workshop you
R04 0720  7    had to have the proper equipment and that was that.
R04 0730  3    When he returned home, the station wagon loaded with
R04 0730 12    tools, Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting
R04 0740 10    in the village, using the recently purchased second
R04 0750  5    car. He was glad. It gave him a chance to unload the
R04 0760  4    stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage
R04 0770  1    of acid comments. He had made such a fuss about buying
R04 0770 12    that second car that he knew he was vulnerable.
R04 0780  7       He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar
R04 0790  6    and turned to stare at the blank stone wall. That was
R04 0800  3    where the pegboard would go on which he would hang
R04 0800 13    his hand tools. In front of it would be his workbench.
R04 0810 10       The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful
R04 0820  8    hours came charging in on him once more, only this
R04 0830  5    time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and
R04 0850  1    send it away. How in the world did one attach a pegboard
R04 0850 13    to a stone wall? How did one attach anything to a stone
R04 0860  9    wall, for that matter? After the pegboard there would
R04 0870  6    be the paneling. He sat down on an old box and focused
R04 0880  5    on the problem. Perhaps one bored holes in the stone
R04 0890  1    with some kind of an electric gadget. But then, when
R04 0890 11    you stuck things into the holes, why didn't they come
R04 0900  8    right out again? It all seemed rather hopeless.
R04 0910  4       He turned his attention to the workbench. Perhaps
R04 0920  2    that was the first thing to do. A workbench had a heavy
R04 0930  1    top and sturdy legs, but how did you attach sturdy
R04 0930 11    legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't
R04 0940  7    wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse
R04 0950  2    when you leaned on it?
R04 0950  7       Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper
R04 0960  8    and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours
R04 0970  6    which, properly handled, would, he had assured him,
R04 0980  2    turn into a workbench. They lay on the cellar floor
R04 0980 12    in a disorderly pile. Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly
R04 0990  8    with his foot. How could anyone know what to do with
R04 1000  7    an assortment like that? Perhaps he had better have
R04 1010  4    someone help him put up the pegboard and build the
R04 1010 14    workbench- someone who knew what he was about. Then
R04 1020 11    at least he would have a place to hang his tools and
R04 1030  9    something to work on. After that everything should
R04 1040  3    be simpler.
R04 1040  5       He went upstairs to phone Crumb. To his amazement
R04 1050  4    he reached him. Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold.
R04 1060  3    He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to
R04 1060 13    a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off
R04 1070 11    the building of the worktable equally lightly. The
R04 1080  4    only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the
R04 1090  4    school job. That was why he hadn't been able to finish
R04 1100  1    the porch. No, he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter.
R04 1100 11    There wasn't any such thing any more. Carpenters all
R04 1110  9    wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's
R04 1120  6    son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails
R04 1130  3    for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school
R04 1140  1    job.
R04 1140  2       There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way.
R04 1140 11    Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell
R04 1150 10    when he was going to be taken drunk. Mr. Crumb would
R04 1160  8    probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night. If
R04 1170  5    he was sober, which was doubtful, he'd have him get
R04 1180  3    in touch with Mr. Crombie.
R04 1180  8       Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember
R04 1190  7    to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon
R04 1200  5    that had come into Mr. Crombie's life since he moved
R04 1210  3    to Highfield, in spite of the fact that he didn't work
R04 1210 14    very fast or very long at a time, and he didn't like
R04 1230 12    to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked
R04 1240  7    to him. He said he was the lonely type and working
R04 1250  4    in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the
R04 1260  2    cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you.
R04 1260 12    So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order
R04 1270 10    to keep Mr. Blatz's mind from funny things. At the
R04 1280  7    same time he watched carefully to see how one attached
R04 1290  4    pegboards to stone walls, but Mr. Blatz was usually
R04 1300  1    standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so
R04 1300 12    simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance.
R04 1310  7       While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and
R04 1320  7    starting the workbench, Mr. Crombie told him of this
R04 1330  5    idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar. Mr.
R04 1340  2    Blatz agreed that this would be pretty. Without further
R04 1340 11    discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile
R04 1350  9    of boards sticking over the end of his light truck
R04 1360  7    and proceeded with the paneling, which he then stained
R04 1370  3    and waxed according to his taste.
R04 1370  9       "Now", he said, "we got to put in some outlets for
R04 1380  9    them power tools; then a couple of fluorescent lamps
R04 1390  4    over the workbench an' I guess we're about through
R04 1400  2    down here".
R04 1400  4       It all did look very efficient and shipshape. There
R04 1410  3    was no question of that. "By the way", said Mr. Blatz,
R04 1420  2    packing his tools into a battered carrier, "them power
R04 1420 11    tools needs extra voltage. I guess you know about that.
R04 1430 10    Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in
R04 1440  9    a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the
R04 1450  7    extra circuits. That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light
R04 1460  3    company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin'".
R04 1470  2       Instead of being depressed by this news, Mr. Crombie
R04 1480  2    was actually relieved. At least the moment was postponed
R04 1480 11    when he had to face the mystery of the power tools.
R04 1490 11    He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs. As usual,
R04 1500  8    Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion
R04 1510  7    of cooking utensils. Mr. Blatz sat down in the only
R04 1520  4    unoccupied kitchen chair.
R04 1520  7       "Well", he said, "got your man fixed up nice down
R04 1530  7    there. He oughta be able to build a new house with
R04 1540  4    all them contraptions". Mr. Crombie watched his wife
R04 1550  2    with an anxious expression. "I was just sayin' to him
R04 1550 12    that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done".
R04 1560 10    Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing.
R04 1570  8       "Oh, that's wonderful", cried Mrs. Crombie. "I have
R04 1580  7    a thousand things for you to do. Doors that won't open,
R04 1590  9    and doors that won't close and shelves and broken ..."
R04 1600  6       "But those are the things I built the workshop for",
R04 1610  4    protested Mr. Crombie. "Those are the things I can
R04 1620  5    do, now that I'm set up".
R04 1620 11       "I've been waiting to get these things done for
R04 1630  9    months", she said. "We won't live long enough if I
R04 1640  7    wait for you, besides which you don't need to worry-
R04 1650  4    there'll be plenty more". But the discussion was academic.
R04 1660  2    Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf
R04 1670  1    above the kitchen sink.
