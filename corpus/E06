E06 0010  1       AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were
E06 0010 10    fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water,
E06 0020 10    boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen,
E06 0030  6    rich people, and the United States Navy.
E06 0040  2       Today the recreational boating scene is awash with
E06 0040 10    heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth
E06 0050  7    of that sport. There are more than 8,000,000 recreational
E06 0060  6    boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000
E06 0070  4    the prediction for within the next decade. About 40,000,000
E06 0080  3    people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has
E06 0090  1    become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation
E06 0090 10    from sea to shining sea. Boats are operated in every
E06 0100  7    state in the Union, with the heaviest concentrations
E06 0110  2    along both coasts and in the Middle West.
E06 0120  1       The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly
E06 0120  9    evident, expectedly, in the areas where boats have
E06 0130  8    always been found: the natural lakes, rivers, and along
E06 0140  5    the nation's coastline. But during the last several
E06 0150  3    years boats were launched in areas where, a short time
E06 0160  1    ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering
E06 0160 13    troughs for livestock.
E06 0170  2       Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources
E06 0180  1    control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies
E06 0180 10    of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit,
E06 0190  7    providing boating and fishing havens all over the country.
E06 0200  6       No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers
E06 0210  3    of the Southwest had been, for example, they could
E06 0220  1    never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile
E06 0220 10    Lake Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which
E06 0230  8    resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the
E06 0240  7    Red River. In 1959, according to the Engineers, Lake
E06 0250  5    Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes
E06 0260  2    and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over
E06 0260 11    1,000,000 persons.
E06 0270  2       Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been
E06 0280  1    created by bringing bodies of water to the people,
E06 0280 10    means have been found to take the people and their
E06 0290  7    boats to the water. Providing these means are about
E06 0300  4    ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000
E06 0310  1    boat trailers now in use. It is a simple task to haul
E06 0310 13    a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir
E06 0320 10    on the new, light, strong, easy-to-operate trailers
E06 0330  5    which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small
E06 0340  4    boat and retail from $100 to $2,000. The sight of sleek
E06 0360  1    inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly
E06 0360  8    along highways many miles from any water is commonplace.
E06 0370  8       Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year
E06 0380  6    'round anchorage for their craft, will recall the tedious
E06 0390  5    procedure of loading their gear into the car, driving
E06 0391  2    to the water, and making trip after trip to transfer
E06 0400  8    the gear to the boat. Today, the boat, on its trailer,
E06 0410  9    is brought to the gear and loaded at the door. Arriving
E06 0420  6    at the waterside, the boat is launched, the family
E06 0430  3    taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is
E06 0430 12    begun.
E06 0440  1       And trailers for boats are not what they started
E06 0440 10    out to be ten years ago. This year, Americans will
E06 0450  8    discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers
E06 0460  5    that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our
E06 0470  3    nation's national, regional and local boat shows. The
E06 0470 11    boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be
E06 0480  9    coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons.
E06 0490  7       The variety of craft on the country's waters today
E06 0500  4    is overwhelming. They range from an eight-foot pram,
E06 0510  2    which you can build yourself for less than $50, to
E06 0510 12    auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000. Boat
E06 0520  8    prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs.
E06 0530  6    In this respect, boats can be compared with houses.
E06 0540  3    There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is
E06 0540 15    easily possible to keep within a set budget. There
E06 0550  9    is no question as to just what is available. You name
E06 0560  7    it, our industry is producing it, and it probably is
E06 0570  4    made in different models.
E06 0570  8       There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected
E06 0580  5    waters or for camping trips. There are houseboats which
E06 0590  3    are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families
E06 0600  1    in comfort and convenience. You can cross an ocean
E06 0600 10    in a fully equipped craft, sail, power, or both, or
E06 0610  7    laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond.
E06 0620  6       You may have your boat of wood, canvas, plywood,
E06 0630  2    plastic, or metal. You may order utility models, inboard
E06 0630 11    or outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and
E06 0640  8    bunks. You may dress it up with any number of accessories
E06 0650  8    or keep it as simple as you choose.
E06 0660  1       Designers and manufacturers have produced models
E06 0660  7    for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version
E06 0670  9    of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than
E06 0680  7    five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around
E06 0690  3    the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on
E06 0690 12    all the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass
E06 0700 10    in a single boat. You pay your money and you take your
E06 0710  9    choice.
E06 0710 10       American technology in engine and hull design is
E06 0720  7    largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American
E06 0730  4    boating. I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the
E06 0740  4    point that when it comes to boats and their motors,
E06 0740 14    Americans excel over any country in the world in the
E06 0760 10    long run.
E06 0760 12       Russia, whose technology is not quite primitive,
E06 0770  7    is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving
E06 0780  6    the outboard motor, for instance.
E06 0790  1       Now here is truly a marvel. The outboard engine
E06 0790  9    of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower,
E06 0800  7    unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in
E06 0810  4    quantity production. These engines can be removed from
E06 0820  2    a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest
E06 0820 11    advantage. Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the
E06 0830 10    American pocketbook, the range being about $150 to
E06 0840  6    $1,000, depending on size.
E06 0840 10       Great thought has been given to making life easier
E06 0860  8    for the growing boating population of the country;
E06 0870  4    and to making the owning of a boat simpler. There was
E06 0880  2    a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it
E06 0880 14    was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable
E06 0890 10    amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or
E06 0900  6    wheel. Having a boat financed through a local bank
E06 0910  2    is done much the same way as an automobile loan is
E06 0910 13    extended. Marine dealers and even some manufacturers
E06 0920  7    who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling
E06 0930  5    you to launch now and pay later.
E06 0940  1       Terms range from one to five years and the interest
E06 0940 11    rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles.
E06 0950  9    Of course, individual financing arrangements depend
E06 0960  4    a good deal on the purchaser's earning power, credit
E06 0970  3    rating and local bank policy.
E06 0970  8       Outboard motors, insurance, and boat repairs may
E06 0980  6    also be financed in the same way as boats. Terms and
E06 0990  4    rates of interest for motors generally follow those
E06 1000  1    for home appliances.
E06 1000  4       When the automobile was in its embryonic stage,
E06 1010  2    such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with
E06 1010 12    the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly
E06 1020  8    terrified being about the only rule governing where,
E06 1030  6    when and how fast a car could go. When air travel was
E06 1040  4    in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and
E06 1050  1    high enough for all. Man had enough to worry about
E06 1050 11    managing to get up there and stay without being burdened
E06 1060  8    with rules once aloft. It was much the same with pleasure
E06 1070  6    boating at first. Come one, come all, the water's fine!
E06 1080  3       As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the
E06 1090  3    airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is
E06 1090 13    the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and
E06 1100  8    may not do; must and should do. However, there is a
E06 1110  6    minimum of legislative restriction on boating.
E06 1120  1       Laws on boating vary according to the state in which
E06 1120 11    the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.
E06 1130 11    What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly
E06 1140  7    prohibited across the boundary line. The main requirement
E06 1150  4    is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the
E06 1160  3    regulations of the state in which the boat will be
E06 1160 13    principally used. If your state has no provisions for
E06 1170  9    the numbering of pleasure boats, you must apply for
E06 1180  6    a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of
E06 1190  4    boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than
E06 1190 12    10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways.
E06 1200  9       State numbering laws differ from each other in many
E06 1210  8    ways. Fees are not the same and some states do not
E06 1230  6    require certain craft, such as sailboats with no power,
E06 1240  3    to be registered at all. Many states have laws regulating
E06 1250  1    the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions
E06 1250 10    regarding the age of motor boat operators.
E06 1260  5       Generally, states reserve for communities the right
E06 1270  3    to have local ordinances regulating speed and other
E06 1270 11    activities. It is always wise to consult your marine
E06 1280  9    dealer, local yacht or boat club secretary, or local
E06 1290  7    law enforcement officers if you are not positive what
E06 1300  4    the regulations are. Ignorance of the law is no better
E06 1310  1    excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability
E06 1310 13    and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy.
E06 1320  9       Hand in hand with the legislative program is the
E06 1330  6    industry's self originated and directed safety program.
E06 1340  3    Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the
E06 1350  1    rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting
E06 1350 11    an intense, coordinated educational program with great
E06 1360  6    success since 1947.
E06 1370  1       A primary factor in the success of the safety program
E06 1370 11    has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual
E06 1380  6    manufacturers. The industry has been its own watch
E06 1390  6    dog. With U.S. Coast Guard cooperation, the American
E06 1400  3    Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended
E06 1410  1    practices and standards for boats and their equipment
E06 1410  9    with reference to safety.
E06 1420  3       Industry interest in safety goes even farther. In
E06 1430  2    1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the
E06 1430 11    National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers
E06 1440  7    and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a
E06 1450  5    testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and
E06 1460  4    their equipment. A new waterfront site for the bureau
E06 1470  1    is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to
E06 1470 11    provide the most modern marine testing facilities as
E06 1480  7    a further tool to keep the sport safe.
E06 1490  3       In addition to these activities, the NAEBM, with
E06 1500  2    headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue, New York City,
E06 1500 10    as well as other associations and individual manufacturers,
E06 1510  7    provide and distribute films, booklets, and public
E06 1520  5    services in regard to proper boat handling and safety
E06 1530  3    afloat.
E06 1530  4       It is important to note the work of the United States
E06 1540  4    Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.
E06 1550  2    Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes
E06 1550 11    in seamanship piloting and small boat handling. These
E06 1560  8    are not governmentally subsidized organizations. This
E06 1580  4    year, over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction.
E06 1590  5       As America on wheels was responsible for an industry
E06 1600  4    of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments
E06 1610  1    where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank
E06 1610 13    deposit, the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts
E06 1620  8    have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate
E06 1630  5    them. Instead of motels, for the boatman there are
E06 1640  5    marinas.
E06 1640  6       The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally
E06 1650  3    to describe a waterfront facility where recreational
E06 1660  1    boats could find protection and basic needs to lay
E06 1660 10    over in relative comfort. Currently, marina is used
E06 1670  6    to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility
E06 1680  4    where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome or all
E06 1690  3    of the following available: gasoline, fresh water,
E06 1690 10    electricity, telephone service, ice, repair facilities,
E06 1700  6    restaurants, sleeping accommodations, a general store,
E06 1710  5    and a grocery store.
E06 1710  9       Yachtel, a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront
E06 1720  8    type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight
E06 1730  8    accommodations on the premises as well as other services.
E06 1740  6    Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel. It indicates
E06 1750  3    the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically
E06 1760  1    to establishments designed to cater to smaller type
E06 1760  9    boats such as outboards. Regardless of nomenclature,
E06 1770  5    yachtels and boatels are marinas.
E06 1780  1       Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities
E06 1790  1    may rightfully be called marinas.
E06 1790  6       A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000
E06 1800  4    commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards
E06 1810  2    in the United States, the majority of which are equipped
E06 1820  1    to handle outboard boats.
