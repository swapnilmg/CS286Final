F29 0010  1       But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington
F29 0010 10    a group more varied in background and interest. Secretary
F29 0020  9    of State Dean Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills
F29 0030  8    College dean, has headed the Rockefeller Foundation
F29 0040  4    and in that role expended large sums for international
F29 0050  2    cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office
F29 0060  1    was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation
F29 0060 10    as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational
F29 0070  7    and Cultural Affairs. ("In the late forties and fifties",
F29 0080  7    Coombs has declared in defining his role, "two strong
F29 0090  5    new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign
F29 0100  3    policy ... economic assistance and military assistance.
F29 0110  1    As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity
F29 0110 11    ... to build a third strong arm, aimed at the development
F29 0120  9    of people, at the fuller realization of their creative
F29 0130  5    human potential, and at better understanding among
F29 0140  2    them".)
F29 0140  3       Many of the new appointees are art collectors.
F29 0150  1    Ambassador-at-Large
F29 0150  4    Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a
F29 0160  3    collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne,
F29 0160 10    Gauguin, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse,
F29 0170  7    Picasso, and Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps,
F29 0180  9    R. Sargent Shriver, Jr., a Kennedy brother-in-law,
F29 0190  7    collects heavily among the moderns, including Kenzo
F29 0200  3    Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury Douglas
F29 0210  2    Dillon owns a prize Monet, Femmes dans un jardin.
F29 0220  1       Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President
F29 0230  1    of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation
F29 0230 10    different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary
F29 0240  7    of Defense, Charles Wilson, who had been head of General
F29 0250  7    Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at times seemed almost
F29 0260  4    anti-intellectual
F29 0260  6    in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara is the scholar-businessman.
F29 0270  5    An inveterate reader of books, he chose while working
F29 0280  3    in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann
F29 0290  2    Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller
F29 0290 11    of Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former
F29 0300  9    Rhodes Scholar, Charles Hitch, who is author of a study
F29 0310  8    on The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age.
F29 0320  5       One of the President's special assistants, the Harvard
F29 0330  3    dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry L. Stimson
F29 0340  3    of the latter's classic memoir, On Active Service.
F29 0350  1    Another, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., has won a Pulitzer
F29 0360  1    Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter.
F29 0360 11    The Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy
F29 0370  9    as a pianist. ("It is always of sorrow to me when I
F29 0380 10    find people who ... neither know nor understand music",
F29 0390  5    he declared not long ago in proposing that White House
F29 0400  4    prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs. Arthur Goldberg,
F29 0410  2    wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally
F29 0420  1    and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in
F29 0420  9    the District of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a
F29 0430  8    new frontier", she claims. "In fact, the search is
F29 0440  6    almost more important than the find".) Mrs. Henry Labouisse,
F29 0450  4    wife of the new director of the foreign aid program,
F29 0460  3    is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.
F29 0460 10       The list goes on. At last count, sixteen former
F29 0470  8    Rhodes Scholars (see box on page 13) had been appointed
F29 0480  6    to the Administration, second in number only to its
F29 0490  4    Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice
F29 0490 10    Department's Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has
F29 0500  6    won a Pulitzer Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster
F29 0510  6    General J. Edward Day, who must deal with matters of
F29 0520  8    postal censorship, is himself author of a novel, Bartholf
F29 0530  6    Street, albeit one he was obliged to publish at his
F29 0550  3    own expense.
F29 0550  5       Two men show promise of playing prominent roles:
F29 0560  2       William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has been
F29 0570  2    a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in
F29 0570 12    Washington about the same time during the early postwar
F29 0580  9    years: Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts;
F29 0590  5    Walton, after a wartime stint with Time-Life, to become
F29 0600  6    bureau chief for the New Republic. Both lived in Georgetown,
F29 0610  5    were unattached, and shared an active social life.
F29 0620  3    Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become
F29 0630  1    one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters,
F29 0630  9    vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in
F29 0640  8    those days. Nonetheless, they found common interests.
F29 0650  4    During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked Walton,
F29 0660  2    an utter novice in organization politics, to assist
F29 0660 10    him. Walton dropped everything to serve as a district
F29 0670  9    co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and
F29 0680  6    proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison
F29 0690  4    officer to critically important New York City.
F29 0700  1       Walton, who served as a correspondent with General
F29 0700  9    James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France,
F29 0710  7    combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a
F29 0720  9    tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials when, after
F29 0730  3    a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with
F29 0740  2    Mrs. Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased
F29 0740 11    the joint to see what was there". But his credentials
F29 0750 10    are impeccable. Already the President and the First
F29 0760  7    Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging
F29 0770  4    from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation
F29 0780  2    of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will
F29 0780 12    continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter,
F29 0790 10    strictly ex officio, for culture.
F29 0800  4       A more official representative is the Secretary
F29 0810  1    of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon
F29 0820  1    first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken
F29 0820 10    man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing
F29 0830  8    right in the middle of the fight. But even while sparring
F29 0840  5    furiously with Republican politicians, he displays
F29 0850  1    a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural
F29 0850 10    attainments. His private dining room has become a way
F29 0860  9    station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow,
F29 0870  6    Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.
F29 0880  1       Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover
F29 0880  8    a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves.
F29 0890  8    After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration,
F29 0900  5    he persuaded the poet to return several months later
F29 0910  4    to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members,
F29 0920  2    members of Congress, and other Washington notables
F29 0920  9    gathered in the State Department auditorium. The event
F29 0930  8    was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans
F29 0940  6    to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to
F29 0950  5    time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment
F29 0960  1    of the Administration.
F29 0960  4       His Ideas in this respect, however, sometimes arouse
F29 0970  3    critical response. One tempest was stirred up last
F29 0980  1    March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot
F29 0980 12    bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by
F29 0990  7    the late Gutzon Borglum, would be sent "on indefinite
F29 1000  6    loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's birthplace. Spokesmen
F29 1010  3    for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly
F29 1020  2    claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of
F29 1020 11    his own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech
F29 1030 12    he had made two years earlier as a Congressman, decrying
F29 1040  7    the more than two hundred statues, monuments, and memorials
F29 1050  5    which "dot the Washington landscape ... as patriotic
F29 1060  4    societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching
F29 1070  1    new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall
F29 1070 11    had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years
F29 1080  9    departed before he is memorialized.
F29 1090  1       He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the
F29 1100  1    case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged
F29 1100 11    to announce that there had been a misunderstanding
F29 1110  7    and that the Secretary had no desire to "hustle" it
F29 1120  5    out of Washington. The last Congress adopted seven
F29 1130  2    bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko,
F29 1140  1    the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced.
F29 1140  9    Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing
F29 1150  8    for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt
F29 1160  5    Island in the Potomac, and T. R.'s own living children,
F29 1170  5    who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary.
F29 1180  4    The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D.
F29 1190  2    Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved
F29 1190 10    with his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its
F29 1200 10    critics, "Instant Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's
F29 1210  6    headaches, since as supervisor of the National Parks
F29 1220  5    Commission he will share in the responsibility for
F29 1230  2    building it.
F29 1230  4       "Washington", President Kennedy has been heard to
F29 1240  5    remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency
F29 1250  1    and northern charm". There have been indications that
F29 1250  9    he hopes to redress that situation, commencing with
F29 1260  7    the White House. One of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns
F29 1270  5    as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings
F29 1280  4    in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine.
F29 1290  2    Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful
F29 1290 11    furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson,
F29 1300  6    the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period
F29 1310  5    pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.
F29 1320  1       Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all
F29 1320  9    this. Not long after moving in she turned up a richly
F29 1330 11    carved desk, hewed from the timbers of the British
F29 1340  6    ship H.M.S. Resolute and presented to President Hayes
F29 1350  3    by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President in his
F29 1360  3    oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the
F29 1370  1    Gazette des Beaux-Arts, she found a description of
F29 1370 10    a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President
F29 1380  8    James Monroe. She traced it to a storage room. With
F29 1390  7    its coating of gold radiator paint removed- a gaucherie
F29 1400  5    of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its rightful
F29 1410  2    place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the
F29 1410 14    White House.
F29 1420  2       But it soon became clear that the search for
F29 1420 11    eighteenth-century
F29 1430  1    furniture (which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period
F29 1440  1    for the White House) must be pursued in places other
F29 1450 10    than government storage rooms. The First Lady appointed
F29 1470  5    a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House,
F29 1480  5    to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways
F29 1490  2    to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living
F29 1490 13    Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello
F29 1500 10    recognizes no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee,
F29 1510  9    headed by Henry Francis Du Pont, contains three times
F29 1520  7    as many Republicans as Democrats.
F29 1530  1       The press releases emanating from the White House
F29 1530  9    give a clue to the activity within. A curator has been
F29 1540 11    appointed. A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical
F29 1550  5    drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard
F29 1560  2    has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein
F29 1570  1    and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute
F29 1580  1    of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House
F29 1580  9    library. Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed
F29 1590  6    enough pieces of Empire furniture, including Dolley
F29 1600  4    Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room in that style.
F29 1610  4    And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware,
F29 1620  1    bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret
F29 1630  1    Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases
F29 1630 11    and put on display in the State dining room.
F29 1640  6       Woman's place is in the home: man must attend to
F29 1650  5    matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems
F29 1660  1    to first confront President Kennedy was the property
F29 1660  9    lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
F29 1670  7    House. Congress had already appropriated money, and
F29 1680  5    plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking
F29 1690  3    Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic
F29 1700  2    calls the "marble monumentality" of government office
F29 1700  9    buildings. While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully
F29 1710  7    pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater, as well
F29 1720  7    as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses,
F29 1730  4    all scheduled for razing.
F29 1730  8       What to do about it now that he was President? Only
F29 1740 10    a few days after moving into the White House. Kennedy
F29 1750  6    made a midnight inspection of the Square. Then he called
F29 1760  4    in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to
F29 1770  2    him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided
F29 1770 12    it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.
F29 1780  8       The situation involved some political perils. One
F29 1790  6    of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged
F29 1800  4    Court of Claims, diagonally across the street from
F29 1810  2    the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown.
F29 1810 11    But Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court,
F29 1820  9    is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan
F29 1830  8    Club and desires to walk to work. More importantly,
F29 1840  5    he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn,
F29 1850  4    Speaker of the House.
F29 1850  8       There were aesthetic problems as well as political.
F29 1860  6    On delving deeper, Walton discovered that most of the
F29 1870  5    buildings fronting the Square could be classified as
F29 1880  2    "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over
F29 1880  9    which many people had grown sentimental, was only a
F29 1890  8    shell of its former self after arduous years as a USO
F29 1900  7    Center. The Dolley Madison House, Walton concluded,
F29 1910  3    was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt to save
F29 1920  3    the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half
F29 1920 11    a century too late".
