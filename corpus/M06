M06 0010  1    It would have killed you in the cabin. Do you have
M06 0010 12    anything for me"?
M06 0020  1       Mercer stammered, not knowing what B'dikkat meant,
M06 0020  8    and the two-nosed man answered for him, "I think he
M06 0030 11    has a nice baby head, but it isn't big enough for you
M06 0040  8    to take yet".
M06 0040 11       Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm.
M06 0050  7       B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when
M06 0060  7    the super-condamine hit Mercer.
M06 0070  1       He tried to run after B'dikkat, to hug the lead
M06 0070 10    spacesuit, to tell B'dikkat that he loved him. He stumbled
M06 0080  8    and fell, but it did not hurt.
M06 0090  2       The many-bodied girl lay near him. Mercer spoke
M06 0090 11    to her.
M06 0100  1       "Isn't it wonderful? You're beautiful, beautiful,
M06 0100  7    beautiful. I'm so happy to be here".
M06 0110  7       The woman covered with growing hands came and sat
M06 0120  6    beside them. She radiated warmth and good fellowship.
M06 0130  2    Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and
M06 0130 10    charming. He struggled out of his clothes. It was foolish
M06 0140 10    and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice
M06 0150  9    people did.
M06 0150 11       The two women babbled and crooned at him.
M06 0160  7       With one corner of his mind he knew that they were
M06 0170  6    saying nothing, just expressing the euphoria of a drug
M06 0180  3    so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it.
M06 0180 12    With most of his mind he was happy. He wondered how
M06 0190 10    anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as
M06 0200  7    nice as this. He tried to tell the Lady Da, but the
M06 0210  4    words weren't quite straight.
M06 0210  8       A painful stab hit him in the abdomen. The drug
M06 0220  8    went after the pain and swallowed it. It was like the
M06 0230  5    cap in the hospital, only a thousand times better.
M06 0240  1    The pain was gone, though it had been crippling the
M06 0240 11    first time.
M06 0250  1       He forced himself to be deliberate. He rammed his
M06 0250 10    mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay
M06 0260  9    pinkly nude beside him in the desert, "That was a good
M06 0270  5    bite. Maybe I will grow another head. That would make
M06 0280  3    B'dikkat happy"!
M06 0280  5       The Lady Da forced the foremost of her bodies in
M06 0290  5    an upright position. Said she, "I'm strong, too. I
M06 0300  3    can talk. Remember, man, remember. People never live
M06 0300 11    forever. We can die, too, we can die like real people.
M06 0310 11    I do so believe in death"!
M06 0320  3       Mercer smiled at her through his happiness.
M06 0330  1       "Of course you can. But isn't this nice ..."
M06 0330 10       With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind
M06 0340 10    go slack. He was wide awake, but he did not feel like
M06 0350  7    doing anything. In that beautiful place, among all
M06 0360  3    those companionable and attractive people, he sat and
M06 0360 11    smiled.
M06 0370  1       B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives.
M06 0370  6    ##
M06 0370  7    Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted
M06 0380  8    him. He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without
M06 0390  5    screams or movement. The agonies of nerves and itching
M06 0400  3    of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near
M06 0410  1    him, but meant nothing. He watched his own body with
M06 0410 11    remote, casual interest. The Lady Da and the hand-covered
M06 0420  8    woman stayed near him. After a long time the half-man
M06 0430  7    dragged himself over to the group with his powerful
M06 0440  2    arms. Having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily
M06 0440 10    at them, and lapsed back into the restful stupor from
M06 0450 10    which he had emerged. Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion,
M06 0460  8    closed his eyes briefly, and opened them to see stars
M06 0470  6    shining. Time had no meaning. The dromozoa fed him
M06 0480  3    in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his
M06 0480 12    needs for cycles of the body.
M06 0490  5       At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of
M06 0500  2    pain.
M06 0500  3       The pains themselves had not changed; he had.
M06 0510  1       He knew all the events which could take place on
M06 0510 11    Shayol. He remembered them well from his happy period.
M06 0520  8    Formerly he had noticed them- now he felt them.
M06 0530  5       He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had
M06 0540  4    the drug, and how much longer they would have to wait
M06 0550  1    before they had it again. She smiled at him with benign,
M06 0550 12    remote happiness; apparently her many torsos, stretched
M06 0560  6    out along the ground, had a greater capacity for retaining
M06 0570  6    the drug than did his body. She meant him well, but
M06 0580  4    was in no condition for articulate speech.
M06 0590  1       The half-man lay on the ground, arteries pulsating
M06 0590  9    prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected
M06 0600  6    his abdominal cavity.
M06 0600  9       Mercer squeezed the man's shoulder.
M06 0610  5       The half-man woke, recognized Mercer and gave him
M06 0620  5    a healthily sleepy grin.
M06 0620  9       "'A good morrow to you, my boy'. That's out of a
M06 0630 10    play. Did you ever see a play"?
M06 0640  3       "You mean a game with cards"?
M06 0640  9       "No", said the half-man, "a sort of eye-machine
M06 0650 10    with real people doing the figures".
M06 0660  3       "I never saw that", said Mercer, "but I"-
M06 0670  1       "But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to
M06 0680  2    come back with the needle".
M06 0680  7       "Yes", said Mercer, a little ashamed of his obviousness.
M06 0690  5       "Soon", said the half-man. That's why I think of
M06 0700  6    plays. We all know what is going to happen. We all
M06 0710  3    know when it is going to happen. We all know what the
M06 0710 15    dummies will do"- he gestured at the hummocks in which
M06 0720 10    the decorticated men were cradled- "and we all know
M06 0730  8    what the new people will ask. But we never know how
M06 0740  6    long a scene is going to take".
M06 0740 13       "What's a 'scene'"? asked Mercer. "Is that the name
M06 0750  9    for the needle"?
M06 0760  2       The half-man laughed with something close to real
M06 0770  1    humor. "No, no, no. You've got the lovelies on the
M06 0770 11    brain. A scene is just a part of a play. I mean we
M06 0780 12    know the order in which things happen, but we have
M06 0790  5    no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or
M06 0800  2    to make calendars and there's not much climate here,
M06 0800 11    so none of us know how long anything takes. The pain
M06 0810  9    seems short and the pleasure seems long. I'm inclined
M06 0820  5    to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each".
M06 0830  2       Mercer did not know what an "Earth-week" was, since
M06 0840  3    he had not been a well-read man before his conviction,
M06 0840 14    but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time.
M06 0850 12    The half-man received a dromozootic implant, turned
M06 0860  5    red in the face, shouted senselessly at Mercer, "Take
M06 0870  4    it out, you fool! Take it out of me"!
M06 0880  1       When Mercer looked on helplessly, the half-man twisted
M06 0880 10    over on his side, his pink dusty back turned to Mercer,
M06 0890 10    and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself.
M06 0900  4       Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before
M06 0910  3    B'dikkat came back. It might have been several days.
M06 0920  1    It might have been several months.
M06 0920  7       Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father;
M06 0930  6    once again they clustered like children. This time
M06 0940  3    B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which
M06 0940 11    had grown out of Mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's
M06 0950  9    head, covered with light hair on top and with dainty
M06 0960  9    eyebrows over the resting eyes. Mercer got the blissful
M06 0970  5    needle.
M06 0970  6       When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh,
M06 0980  4    he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which
M06 0990  2    held the head to his own body. He saw the child-face
M06 1000 10    grimace as the head was cut; he felt the far, cool
M06 1010 11    flash of unimportant pain, as B'dikkat dabbed the wound
M06 1020  6    with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding
M06 1030  4    immediately.
M06 1030  5       The next time it was two legs growing from his chest.
M06 1040  5       Then there had been another head beside his own.
M06 1050  3       Or was that after the torso and legs, waist to toe-tips,
M06 1060  1    of the little girl which had grown from his side?
M06 1060 11       He forgot the order.
M06 1070  4       He did not count time.
M06 1070  9       Lady Da smiled at him often, but there was no love
M06 1080  9    in this place. She had lost the extra torsos. In between
M06 1090  6    teratologies, she was a pretty and shapely woman; but
M06 1100  3    the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper
M06 1110  1    to him, repeated some thousands of time, repeated with
M06 1110 10    smiles and hope, "People never live forever".
M06 1120  6       She found this immensely comforting, even though
M06 1130  4    Mercer did not make much sense out of it.
M06 1140  1       Thus events occurred, and victims changed in appearance,
M06 1140  9    and new ones arrived. Sometimes B'dikkat took the new
M06 1150  9    ones, resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out
M06 1160  8    brains, in a ground-truck to be added to other herds.
M06 1170  7    The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without
M06 1180  2    human speech when the dromozoa struck them.
M06 1180  9       Finally, Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to
M06 1190  8    the door of the cabin. He had to fight the bliss of
M06 1200  7    super-condamine to do it. Only the memory of previous
M06 1210  3    hurt, bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that
M06 1210 11    if he did not ask B'dikkat when he, Mercer, was happy,
M06 1220 11    the answer would no longer be available when he needed
M06 1230  8    it. Fighting pleasure itself, he begged B'dikkat to
M06 1240  5    check the records and to tell him how long he had been
M06 1250  4    there.
M06 1250  5       B'dikkat grudgingly agreed, but he did not come
M06 1260  2    out of the doorway. He spoke through the public address
M06 1260 12    box built into the cabin, and his gigantic voice roared
M06 1270  9    out over the empty plain, so that the pink herd of
M06 1280  7    talking people stirred gently in their happiness and
M06 1290  3    wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting
M06 1300  1    to tell them. When he said it, they thought it exceedingly
M06 1300 12    profound, though none of them understood it, since
M06 1310  8    it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been
M06 1320  5    on Shayol:
M06 1320  7       "Standard years- eighty-four years, seven months,
M06 1330  4    three days, two hours, eleven and one half minutes.
M06 1340  3    Good luck, fellow".
M06 1340  6       Mercer turned away.
M06 1350  1       The secret little corner of his mind, which stayed
M06 1350 10    sane through happiness and pain, made him wonder about
M06 1360  7    B'dikkat. What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol?
M06 1370  7    What kept him happy without super-condamine? Was B'dikkat
M06 1380  3    a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had
M06 1390  4    hopes of going back to his own planet some day, surrounded
M06 1400  1    by a family of little cow-people resembling himself?
M06 1400 10    Mercer, despite his happiness, wept a little at the
M06 1410  8    strange fate of B'dikkat. His own fate he accepted.
M06 1420  5       He remembered the last time he had eaten- actual
M06 1430  4    eggs from an actual pan. The dromozoa kept him alive,
M06 1440  1    but he did not know how they did it.
M06 1440 10       He staggered back to the group. The Lady Da, naked
M06 1450  6    in the dusty plain, waved a hospitable hand and showed
M06 1460  3    that there was a place for him to sit beside her. There
M06 1470  1    were unclaimed square miles of seating space around
M06 1470  9    them, but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture
M06 1480  6    none the less.
M06 1480  9    #IV#
M06 1490  1    The years, if they were years, went by. The land of
M06 1490 12    Shayol did not change.
M06 1500  2       Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly
M06 1500 10    across the plain to the herd of men; those who could
M06 1510 11    talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez.
M06 1520  8    There was night and day, but no setting of crops, no
M06 1530  6    change of season, no generations of men. Time stood
M06 1550  2    still for these people, and their load of pleasure
M06 1550 11    was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the
M06 1560  8    dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very
M06 1570  6    remote meaning.
M06 1570  8       "People never live forever".
M06 1580  1       Her statement was a hope, not a truth in which they
M06 1590  1    could believe. They did not have the wit to follow
M06 1590 11    the stars in their courses, to exchange names with
M06 1600  6    each other, to harvest the experience of each for the
M06 1610  5    wisdom of all. There was no dream of escape for these
M06 1620  1    people. Though they saw the old-style chemical rockets
M06 1620 10    lift up from the field beyond B'dikkat's cabin, they
M06 1630  7    did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of
M06 1640  6    transmuted flesh.
M06 1640  8       Far long ago, some other prisoner than one of these
M06 1650  7    had tried to write a letter. His handwriting was on
M06 1660  4    a rock. Mercer read it, and so had a few of the others,
M06 1670  1    but they could not tell which man had done it. Nor
M06 1670 12    did they care.
M06 1680  1       The letter, scraped on stone, had been a message
M06 1680 10    home. They could still read the opening: "Once, I was
M06 1690  9    like you, stepping out of my window at the end of day,
M06 1700 10    and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place
M06 1710  4    I lived in. Once, like you, I had one head, two hands,
M06 1720  2    ten fingers on my hands. The front part of my head
M06 1720 13    was called a face, and I could talk with it. Now I
M06 1730 11    can only write, and that only when I get out of pain.
