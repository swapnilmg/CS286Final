N27 0010  1    FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now, Jack Carter, a big overgrown
N27 0010 10    boy of fifteen with a fuzzy, pimpled face and greenish
N27 0020  8    catlike eyes with a lot of red in them, had been haunted
N27 0030  8    by a dream, a vision, of a Woman. This Woman had no
N27 0040  4    distinct shape or size and no particular face, but
N27 0040 13    she radiated warmth, a sweet warmth; she would talk
N27 0050  9    to him in a soothing voice about things his mother
N27 0060  6    would have said were not nice and put her hands on
N27 0070  4    him and kiss him passionately. When she would do these
N27 0080  1    things, he would turn blind for an instant and become
N27 0080 11    sick at his stomach. Then he would run to the toilet
N27 0090  8    behind the house. Sometimes he did this three or four
N27 0100  6    times a day, for this Woman was almost always with
N27 0110  2    him. He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether
N27 0110 12    his mother and father knew- thinking they might see
N27 0120  8    it in his eyes or smell it on him. But they never said
N27 0130  8    anything, so he figured it was all right.
N27 0140  1       And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room
N27 0150  1    Chestnut school, where Jack was a pupil in the eighth
N27 0150 11    grade, the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's
N27 0160  7    face and figure. He could not keep his eyes off her
N27 0170  7    when at school; when he went home at night, he took
N27 0180  4    her with him in his mind, and she did the things the
N27 0180 16    anonymous Woman used to do, and he did the thing afterwards
N27 0190 11    each time as he used to do. When he awoke in the mornings,
N27 0200 11    she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get
N27 0210  7    to school to be near her in the flesh.
N27 0220  1       Miss Langford (her first name was Evelyn) was an
N27 0220 10    attractive girl. Tall, blonde, blue-eyes, fair, buxom
N27 0230  8    without being heavy, she cut a fine figure of budding
N27 0240  6    womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh,
N27 0250  4    starched summer dress. Something was beginning to stir
N27 0260  1    and come alive in her, too (it may have been there
N27 0260 12    for a good while, since she was twenty now; but if
N27 0270  7    it had been, it had been smothered until now by fear):
N27 0280  4    you could tell it by the way she watched the older,
N27 0290  1    bigger boys, like Jack. She would look at Jack, with
N27 0290 11    that hidden something in her eyes, and Jack would see
N27 0300  9    the Woman and become breathless and a little sick.
N27 0310  5       School began in August, the hottest part of the
N27 0320  4    year, and for the first few days Miss Langford was
N27 0320 14    very lenient with the children, letting them play a
N27 0330  9    lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one
N27 0340  6    another. The first two or three days they went home
N27 0350  3    early.
N27 0350  4       All, that is, except Jack. He hung around the schoolhouse,
N27 0360  3    watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford
N27 0370  2    straightened desks and put the room in order. Once
N27 0370 11    (this was on the third day of school) she kneeled down
N27 0380 10    to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor
N27 0390  7    and Jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of
N27 0400  6    incredibly white leg. He thought for a moment his heart
N27 0410  3    had stopped beating. About that time Miss Langford
N27 0410 11    straightened up and looked out the window directly
N27 0420  8    at him, he thought, although probably she didn't even
N27 0430  5    see him. He jumped back, ducked and ran, crouching,
N27 0440  2    down the hill away from the school.
N27 0440  9       He didn't look back and he ran until he was out
N27 0450 10    of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath; then
N27 0460  5    he slowed to a walk. The vision became even stronger
N27 0465  1    now. "I'll get her yet", he muttered to himself. "I've
N27 0470  6    got to get her". That night he dreamed a dream violent
N27 0480  4    with passion, in which he and the Woman, now the teacher,
N27 0490  2    did everything except engage in the act (and this probably
N27 0500  1    only because he had never engaged in the act in reality),
N27 0500 12    and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire.
N27 0510  9       He ate litle that morning, and his mother became
N27 0520  6    concerned, inasmuch as he usually ate heartily.
N27 0530  2       "What's the matter, honey"? she said, with the solicitude
N27 0540  2    of a middle-aged woman for her only child. "Aren't
N27 0550  1    you hungry"?
N27 0550  3       "No, I'm not hungry", he said, pushing back the
N27 0560  3    bacon and eggs. Outside it was already hot at 7:30
N27 0560 13    A.M., and it was getting hot in the kitchen. He felt
N27 0570 11    a little sick at his stomach.
N27 0580  3       "Are you sick"?
N27 0580  6       "No", he said. "I'll be all right. I guess it's
N27 0590  8    this hot weather".
N27 0600  1       "Don't you play hard today then. And if you get
N27 0600 11    sick, ask the teacher to let you come home early. Daddy
N27 0610  8    left the car for me, and I'm going to town this afternoon".
N27 0620  6       "O. K., I won't play hard", he promised.
N27 0630  5       Just then Charles Lever yelled, "Hey, Jack", from
N27 0640  3    the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house,
N27 0650  1    and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted
N27 0650 11    out the kitchen door, yelling "Good-bye, Mom" over
N27 0660  7    his shoulder.
N27 0660  9       "Whaddya say, boy"? Charles said, grinning, showing
N27 0670  7    his huge yellow teeth. Charles, also fifteen, was tall
N27 0680  7    and skinny, scraggly, with straight black hair like
N27 0690  5    an Indian's and sharp brown eyes. He considered himself
N27 0700  2    handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after
N27 0700 12    him.
N27 0710  1       "You know what I done last night"? Charles said
N27 0710 10    as they picked their way over the rocky road which
N27 0720 10    led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway, through
N27 0730  6    a corn field and a patch of woods to the school.
N27 0740  3       Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded
N27 0750  1    would involve a girl and probably be dirty, because
N27 0750 10    girls were Charles' only apparent interest. But Jack
N27 0760  6    always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles'
N27 0770  4    revelations (even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration
N27 0780  3    or invention), so he usually invited them, as he did
N27 0790  2    now. "No. What"?
N27 0790  5       "I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars
N27 0800  6    down there by the quarry".
N27 0800 11       A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed
N27 0810  6    across Jack's mind. His heart beat faster. "Hell you
N27 0820  5    say"? he said, lapsing into the profanity he often
N27 0830  3    used when away from his parents and especially when
N27 0830 12    he was with Charles. "How'd you do it"?
N27 0840  8       "Hell, I jist got on top of-"
N27 0850  5       "No, I mean how'd you get her to do it"?
N27 0860  3       "Hell, I jist ask her".
N27 0860  8       "Jist like that"?
N27 0870  2       "Hell, yes. She's been hangin' around me a lot here
N27 0880  4    lately, and I figgered I might as well's try it. Besides
N27 0890  1    I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin'
N27 0890 12    it".
N27 0900  1       "I never heard that".
N27 0900  5       "It's all over Branchville. If you'd get out of
N27 0910  6    your back yard once in a while you might even get her
N27 0920  3    your ownself".
N27 0920  5       "I might try it one of these days", Jack said wonderingly,
N27 0930  4    thinking of Miss Langford.
N27 0930  8    ##
N27 0930  9    WHEN THEY reached the school, a gang of boys and girls
N27 0940 11    were already there playing "crack the whip" in front
N27 0950  8    of the schoolhouse. Miss Langford, in a fresh white
N27 0960  6    dress and low-heeled white sandals, without socks,
N27 0970  2    was out there with them, trying to get them inside.
N27 0980  1       "Time for books", she yelled, jingling a little
N27 0980  8    five-and-dime store bell in her right hand. "Let's
N27 0990  7    go inside".
N27 0990  9       "Oh, come on Miss Langford, play with us just onct",
N27 1000  9    one of the little girls begged, smiling wistfully.
N27 1010  4       "No, not now", said the teacher. "Maybe at dinner
N27 1020  4    time. Come inside now".
N27 1020  8       The children grudgingly stopped playing then and
N27 1030  6    straggled into the schoolhouse.
N27 1040  1       Jack watched Miss Langford all morning. He could
N27 1040  9    think of nothing else save his mental image of her
N27 1050  8    nude figure and what Charles had said that morning
N27 1060  5    about Margaret Rider. Occasionally he would look across
N27 1070  3    the aisle at Margaret, fourteen and demure in a fresh
N27 1070 13    green organdy dress, sitting in the sixth-grade row,
N27 1080  9    and he coud hardly believe she would do what Charles
N27 1090  6    had said she did.
N27 1090 10       At noontime, remembering what the teacher had said
N27 1100  7    about maybe playing with the kids, Jack stayed close
N27 1110  5    to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys, except
N27 1120  2    Charles, went off out the road to play ball. "Why ain't
N27 1130  1    you playin' ball"? he asked Charles suspiciously as
N27 1130  9    they sat in the well-house shade, watching the girls
N27 1140  9    congregate in front of the schoolhouse. "Miss Langford,
N27 1150  4    come out and play with us like you promised", several
N27 1160  3    of the little girls called.
N27 1160  8       "I'd druther stay here and watch the girls", Charles
N27 1170  8    grinned. "Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll
N27 1180  8    see up their dress".
N27 1190  1       "Maybe", Jack said idly, watching for Miss Langford.
N27 1190  8       Presently she came out of the schoolhouse. When
N27 1200  8    she appeared, two or three of the little girls jumped
N27 1210  6    up and down, yelling, "Goody, goody".
N27 1220  1       "Let's play with 'em", Jack said, rising from where
N27 1230  1    he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants.
N27 1230 12       "O.K." Charles rose also, and the two of them moved
N27 1240 10    over to join the girls.
N27 1250  3       They played crack the whip a few minutes without
N27 1250 12    mishap. Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the
N27 1260 11    line of girls, Jack, in the middle of the line, gave
N27 1270  9    an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards,
N27 1280  4    sitting down hard, her dress flying over her head.
N27 1290  3    While she was struggling to get her skirt down and
N27 1290 13    get on her feet again, Jack ran over, offered her his
N27 1300 11    hand and said, "Gosh, I'm sorry, Miss Langford. I didn't
N27 1310  7    mean to pull so hard".
N27 1320  1       "That's all right", she said, tossing her head back
N27 1330  1    to get the hair out of her eyes. "It was my fault".
N27 1330 13    With one hand she held her skirt down while she took
N27 1340  9    Jack's extended hand with the other. When her hand
N27 1350  6    touched his, fire went through Jack and he felt weak,
N27 1360  3    but he managed somehow to get her on her feet. He thought
N27 1370  1    she gave him that look with the hidden something in
N27 1370 11    it as he let her hand go.
N27 1380  2       "Thank you", she said, dusting herself off.
N27 1390  1       "Will you play with us again, Miss Langford"? one
N27 1390  9    of the little girls said.
N27 1400  3       "No more today. Maybe some other day".
N27 1410  1       "Oh, shucks", the girl said. "I don't believe I'll
N27 1420  1    play any more neither".
N27 1420  5       "Me neither", others said, and soon the game broke
N27 1430  4    up, the children going off in pairs, in larger groups
N27 1440  1    and alone.
N27 1440  3       Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing
N27 1450  1    midday sun, past Robert Allen's three-room, tarpapered
N27 1450  9    house, toward the field where the other boys were playing
N27 1460  9    ball, thinking of what he would do in order to make
N27 1470  8    Miss Langford have him stay in after school- because
N27 1480  2    this was the day he had decided when he thought he
N27 1480 13    saw the look in her eyes.
N27 1490  6       When he came back to the schoolhouse, his mind was
N27 1500  4    made up. He simply would not work his arithmetic problems
N27 1510  1    when the teacher held his class. That should do it,
N27 1510 11    he thought, because Miss Langford had said she was
N27 1520  7    going to be strict about school work. He had considered
N27 1530  5    throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or
N27 1540  2    pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him,
N27 1540 13    but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities:
N27 1550 10    the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall
N27 1560  9    in a corner instead of stay in after school.
N27 1570  4       The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on
N27 1580  3    was that someone else might fail to do his work, too,
N27 1580 14    and the teacher would have that person stay late along
N27 1590  9    with Jack. "But I've got to take a chance on it", he
N27 1600 10    told himself desperately.
N27 1610  1       To his surprise his plan worked perfectly. "All
N27 1610  9    right, if you can't do your arithmetic during school
N27 1620  7    hours you can do it after school it out", Miss Langford
N27 1630  5    said firmly, not smiling. "You will stay here thirty
N27 1640  4    minutes after the others go home this afternoon and
N27 1650  1    work your problems".
N27 1650  4       And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon
N27 1670  1    Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window, looking
N27 1670 11    out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner, while the
N27 1680 10    other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces
N27 1690  8    as they dispersed, going home. He scarcely saw them.
N27 1700  3    His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he
N27 1700 13    was trying to think, his mind seeming to scream at
N27 1710 10    him like a hurt or frightened child, "How will I do
N27 1720  6    it?
