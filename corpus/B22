B22 0010  1    #RESUMING ATMOSPHERIC TESTS#
B22 0010  4    ONE OF THE inescapable realities of the Cold War is
B22 0020  6    that is has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically
B22 0030  3    unique set of moral dilemmas. The first dilemma was
B22 0040  1    the morality of nuclear warfare itself. That dilemma
B22 0040  9    is as much with us as ever. The second great dilemma
B22 0050  8    has been the morality of nuclear testing, a dilemma
B22 0060  4    which has suddenly become acute because of the present
B22 0070  1    series of Soviet tests.
B22 0070  5       When this second dilemma first became obvious- during
B22 0080  2    the mid to late '50's- the United States appeared to
B22 0090  3    have three choices. It could have unilaterally abandoned
B22 0100  1    further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard
B22 0100 10    to future generations. It could have continued testing
B22 0110  6    to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger
B22 0120  5    was far less than the danger of Communist world domination.
B22 0130  3    Or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation- some
B22 0140  4    way of stopping the tests without loss to national
B22 0140 13    security. This third choice was in fact made.
B22 0150  7       With the resumption of Soviet testing and their
B22 0160  4    intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the hope
B22 0170  2    that this third choice would prove viable has been
B22 0170 11    shaken. Once again, the United States must choose.
B22 0180  7    And once again, the choices are much the same. Only
B22 0200  6    this time around the conditions are different and the
B22 0210  3    choice is far harder.
B22 0210  7       The first choice, abandoning tests entirely, would
B22 0220  3    not only be unpopular domestically, but would surely
B22 0230  1    be exploited by the Russians. The second choice, full
B22 0230 10    testing, has become even more risky just because the
B22 0240  8    current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated
B22 0250  4    the atmosphere. The third choice, negotiation, presupposes,
B22 0260  2    as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal of wishful
B22 0270  3    thinking to make it appear reasonable.
B22 0270  9       We take the position, however, that the third choice
B22 0280  7    still remains the only sane one open to us. It is by
B22 0290  8    no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the
B22 0300  3    arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.
B22 0310  1    Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice;
B22 0310 11    one which, should it fail, will not have contaminated
B22 0320  7    the conscience. That is the contamination we most fear.
B22 0330  5    ##
B22 0330  6    LEAVING ASIDE the choice of unilateral cessation of
B22 0340  3    tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question
B22 0350  1    must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests
B22 0350 10    on our part would not be a good choice. For that is
B22 0360 10    the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans
B22 0370  5    are now proposing. In particular, Governor Nelson Rockefeller
B22 0380  3    has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the
B22 0390  3    case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.
B22 0390 10       Speaking recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller
B22 0400  6    said that "to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons
B22 0410  7    in the face of the recent Soviet tests, we are now
B22 0420  5    clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests".
B22 0430  1    Taking account of the fact that such a move on our
B22 0430 12    part would be unpopular in world opinion, he argued
B22 0440  7    that the responsibility of the United States is "to
B22 0450  4    do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular, but
B22 0460  2    what is right".
B22 0460  5       What was missing in the Governor's argument, as
B22 0470  3    in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would
B22 0480  1    enable one to make the ethical leap from what might
B22 0480 11    be militarily desirable to what is right. The possibility,
B22 0490  7    as he asserted, that the Russians may get ahead of
B22 0500  5    us or come closer to us because of their tests does
B22 0510  2    not supply the needed ethical premise- unless, of course,
B22 0510 11    we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear
B22 0520  7    superiority is now taken as a moral demand.
B22 0530  5       Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension
B22 0540  2    to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether
B22 0540 11    our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity
B22 0550  9    of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests
B22 0560  9    absolutely necessary. Recent statements by the President
B22 0570  4    and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the contrary,
B22 0580  2    assured us that our lead is very great. Unless the
B22 0580 12    Administration and the Defense Department have been
B22 0590  7    deceiving us, the facts do not support the assertion
B22 0600  6    that we are "compelled" to resume atmospheric testing.
B22 0610  2       It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of
B22 0620  2    atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future,
B22 0620 11    be necessary and even justifiable. But a resumption
B22 0630  7    does not seem justifiable now. What we need to realize
B22 0640  6    is that the increasingly great contamination of the
B22 0650  3    atmosphere by the Soviet tests has radically increased
B22 0650 11    our own moral obligations. We now have to think not
B22 0660 10    only of our national security but also of the future
B22 0670  7    generations who will suffer from any tests we might
B22 0680  3    undertake. This is an ethical demand which cannot be
B22 0680 12    evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon
B22 0690  9    superiority or even of the evil of Communism.
B22 0700  6       Too often in the past Russian tactics have been
B22 0710  4    used to justify like tactics on our part. There ought
B22 0720  1    to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves
B22 0720 12    to go regardless of what Russia does. The refusal to
B22 0730  8    resume atmospheric testing would be a good start.
B22 0740  6    #ECUMENICAL HOPES#
B22 0740  8    WHEN HIS Holiness Pope John XXIII, first called for an
B22 0750  8    Ecumenical Council, and at the same time voiced his
B22 0760  5    yearning for Christian unity, the enthusiasm among
B22 0770  2    Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate.
B22 0770  8    With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon
B22 0780 10    divided Christendom. But as the more concrete plans
B22 0790  6    for the work of the Council gradually became known,
B22 0800  2    there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment
B22 0800 10    on all sides. The Council we now know will concern
B22 0810  8    itself directly only with the internal affairs of the
B22 0820  6    Church.
B22 0820  7       As it has turned out, however, the excessive enthusiasm
B22 0830  4    in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second
B22 0840  5    were both wrong responses. Two things have happened
B22 0850  1    in recent months to bring the Council into perspective:
B22 0850 10    each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy.
B22 0860  8       First of all, it is now known that Pope John sees
B22 0870  6    the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely
B22 0880  4    necessary step toward Christian unity. Far from being
B22 0890  2    irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes
B22 0890 10    that a revivified Church is required in order that
B22 0900  8    the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible
B22 0910  5    light. Equally significant, Pope John has said that
B22 0920  4    Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian
B22 0930  1    disunity. A major aim of the Council will be to remove
B22 0930 12    as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands
B22 0940 10    in the way of unity.
B22 0950  1       Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions
B22 0950  9    by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian
B22 0960 10    unity is still very much alive and growing within the
B22 0970  7    Church. The establishment, by the Holy Father, of a
B22 0980  5    permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was
B22 0990  3    the most dramatic mark of this concern. The designation
B22 0990 12    of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council
B22 1000  9    of Churches assembly in New Delhi as "official" observers
B22 1010  8    reverses the Church's earlier stand. The public appeal
B22 1020  6    by the new Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Cicognani,
B22 1030  5    for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion
B22 1040  4    was still another remarkable act. Nor can one forget
B22 1050  2    Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop
B22 1050  9    of Canterbury.
B22 1060  1       Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate
B22 1070  1    for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone
B22 1070 10    the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward
B22 1080  9    the Protestant and Orthodox Churches. Noting all the
B22 1090  7    difficulties that stand in the way of reunion, he has
B22 1100  7    said that they ought not to discourage anyone. For
B22 1110  2    discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts,
B22 1110 10    "would show that one placed excessive trust in purely
B22 1120  9    human means without thinking of the omnipotence of
B22 1130  6    God, the irresistible efficacy of prayer, the action
B22 1140  4    of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit". Can any
B22 1150  3    Christian fail to respond to these words?
B22 1150 10    #THE BUDGET DEFICIT#
B22 1160  1    THE ADMINISTRATION'S official budget review, which
B22 1160  7    estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current
B22 1170  9    fiscal year, isn't making anyone happy. Certainly it
B22 1180  6    isn't making the President happy, and he has been doing
B22 1190  6    his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into
B22 1200  3    its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize
B22 1200 11    wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next
B22 1210 11    year.
B22 1210 12       We sympathize with Mr. Kennedy, but we feel bound
B22 1220  8    to say that his budget review doesn't please us either,
B22 1230  5    although for very different reasons. Furthermore, we
B22 1240  3    find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying
B22 1250  1    than reassuring.
B22 1250  3       In the first place, a large part of the discrepancy
B22 1260  2    between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion
B22 1270  1    dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate
B22 1270 11    of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result
B22 1280  8    of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political
B22 1290  6    booby-trap to his successor. The Eisenhower budget
B22 1300  2    was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and
B22 1310  1    yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be
B22 1310 10    received.
B22 1320  1       The rest of the deficit is also easily understood.
B22 1320  9    Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for
B22 1330  7    defense, an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise
B22 1340  5    policies of the Eisenhhower Administration, quite apart
B22 1350  2    from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere. Four
B22 1350 11    hundred million dollars of the increase is for the
B22 1360  9    expanded space program, a responsibility similarly
B22 1370  3    neglected by Mr. Eisenhower. The farm program will
B22 1380  2    cost an additional 1.5 billion, because of unusual
B22 1380 10    weather factors, the Food for Peace program and other
B22 1390  9    new measures. Anti-recession programs- aid for the
B22 1400  4    unemployed, their children and for depressed areas-
B22 1410  1    account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar
B22 1420  1    deficit.
B22 1420  2       Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the
B22 1420 11    Kennedy programs are not too large but too small, most
B22 1430 10    seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up
B22 1440  7    and in aid and welfare measures. And yet Mr. Kennedy
B22 1450  5    persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of
B22 1460  2    the right with apologies and promises of "tightening
B22 1460 10    up" and "economizing". We wish the President would
B22 1470  7    remember that "fiscal responsibility" was the battle-cry
B22 1480  6    of the party that lost the election. The party that
B22 1490  4    won used to say something about a New Frontier.
B22 1500  1    #ETHICS AND PEACE#
B22 1500  4    INTRODUCTION of the "dialogue" principle proved strikingly
B22 1510  3    effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the
B22 1520  3    Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington
B22 1540  1    the last weekend in October. Two of the principal addresses
B22 1540 11    were delivered by prominent Protestants, and when the
B22 1550  7    speaker was a Catholic, one "discussant" on the dais
B22 1560  6    tended to be of another religious persuasion.
B22 1570  2       Several effects were immediately evident. Sessions
B22 1580  1    devoted to "Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends", "Moral
B22 1580  9    Principle and Political Judgment", "Christian Ethics
B22 1590  6    in the Cold War" and related subjects proved to be
B22 1600  8    much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics
B22 1610  5    were merely talking to themselves. Usually questions
B22 1620  2    from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker
B22 1630  1    or discussion leader.
B22 1630  4       In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion
B22 1640  2    on the natural law, which Dr. William V. O'Brien of
B22 1650  2    Georgetown University, advanced as the basis for widely
B22 1650 10    acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy. That
B22 1660  7    Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough
B22 1670  5    going-over from a number of the participants, but in
B22 1680  4    the end the concept came to reassert itself. Speakers
B22 1690  1    declared that Protestants often make use of it, if,
B22 1690 10    perhaps, by some other name. A Lebanese Moslem told
B22 1700  9    about its existence and application in the Islamic
B22 1710  5    tradition as the "divine law", while a C.A.I.P. member
B22 1720  3    who has been working in close association with delegates
B22 1730  3    of the new U.N. nations told of its widespread recognition
B22 1740  1    on the African continent. The impression was unmistakable
B22 1750  1    that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law
B22 1750 11    is a functioning generality with a certain objective
B22 1760  6    existence.
B22 1760  7       Another question that arose was the nature of the
B22 1770  8    dialogue itself. The stimulus from the confrontation
B22 1780  3    of philosophical systems involving certain differences
B22 1790  1    was undeniable. It was expected that the comparison
B22 1790  9    of different approaches to ethics would produce a better
B22 1800  8    grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension
B22 1810  5    of one's own. But a realization that each group has
B22 1820  5    much of substance to learn from the other also developed,
B22 1830  1    and a strong conviction grew that each had insights
B22 1830 10    and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable
B22 1840  6    solutions of urgent political issues.
B22 1850  2       One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these
B22 1860  1    discussions was to focus attention on practical applications
B22 1860  9    and the necessity of being armed with the facts: knowledge
B22 1870  8    of the destructive force of even the tiniest "tactical"
B22 1880  7    atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as
B22 1890  4    to the advisability of its use- to defend Berlin, for
B22 1900  2    example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our
B22 1900 10    political judgments needs to be recognized and taken
B22 1910  8    into due account; it is necessary to perceive the extent
B22 1920  7    of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative.
