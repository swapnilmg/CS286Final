H13 0010  1    _MR. DOOLEY._
H13 0010  3       Mr. Speaker, for several years now the commuter
H13 0020  1    railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have
H13 0020  8    found it increasingly difficult to render the kind
H13 0030  6    of service our expanding population wants and is entitled
H13 0040  5    to have. The causes of the decline of the commuter
H13 0050  1    railroads are many and complex- high taxes, losses
H13 0050  9    of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air
H13 0060  6    carriers, to name but two. And the solutions to the
H13 0070  5    problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied,
H13 0080  2    ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete
H13 0090  1    discontinuance of this important service.
H13 0090  6       There have been a number of sound plans proposed.
H13 0100  5    But none of these has been implemented. Instead we
H13 0110  3    have stood idly by, watched our commuter railroad service
H13 0120  1    decline, and have failed to offer a helping hand. Though
H13 0120 11    the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan
H13 0130 10    areas each day has increased tremendously since World
H13 0140  4    War II, total annual rail commutation dropped 124
H13 0150  3    million from 1947 to 1957. Nowhere has this decline
H13 0160  1    been more painfully evident than in the New York City
H13 0160 11    area. Here the New York Central Railroad, one of the
H13 0170  8    Nation's most important carriers, has alone lost 47.6
H13 0180  6    percent of its passengers since 1949.
H13 0190  1       At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter
H13 0190 10    railroads, a new threat to the continued operations
H13 0200  8    of the New York Central has appeared in the form of
H13 0210  6    the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad's proposal for control
H13 0220  3    of the Baltimore + Ohio railroads.
H13 0220  9       The New York Central has pointed out that this control,
H13 0230  8    if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
H13 0240  3    would give the combined C. + O.-B. + O. Railroad a
H13 0250  5    total of 185 points served in common with the New York
H13 0260  3    Central. Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful,
H13 0270  1    but it gives the combined system the ability to take
H13 0270 11    freight traffic away from the New York Central and
H13 0280  8    other railroads serving the area.
H13 0290  1       The New York Central notes: "
H13 0290  6       The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding
H13 0300  5    by the C. + O.-B. + O. provides the backbone of Central's
H13 0310  5    revenues. These revenues make it possible to provide
H13 0320  4    essential freight and passenger service over the entire
H13 0330  1    New York Central system as well as the New York area
H13 0330 12    commuter and terminal freight services. If these services
H13 0340  8    are to be maintained, the New York Central must have
H13 0350  7    the revenues to make them possible".
H13 0360  1       The New York Central today handles 60 percent of
H13 0360 10    all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York
H13 0370  8    City. This is a $14 million operation involving 3,500
H13 0380  6    employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively.
H13 0390  3    A blow to this phase of the Central's operations would
H13 0400  2    have serious economic consequences not only to the
H13 0400 10    railroad itself, but to the 40,000 people per day who
H13 0410 10    are provided with efficient, reasonably priced transportation
H13 0420  4    in and out of the city. "
H13 0430  1       There is a workable alternative to this potentially
H13 0430  8    dangerous and harmful C. + O.-B. + O. merger scheme"-
H13 0440  9       The Central has pointed out. "
H13 0450  4       The logic of creating a strong, balanced, competitive
H13 0460  2    two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious
H13 0470  1    that B. + O. was publicly committed to the approach
H13 0470 11    outlined here.
H13 0480  1       Detailed studies of the plan were well underway.
H13 0480  9    Though far from completion, these studies indicated
H13 0490  7    beyond a doubt that savings would result which would
H13 0500  5    be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned,
H13 0510  2    their investors, their customers, their users, and
H13 0510  9    to the public at large.
H13 0520  4       Then, abandoning the studies in the face of their
H13 0530  2    promising outlook for all concerned, B. + O. entered
H13 0530 11    on-again-off-again negotiations with C. + O. which
H13 0540  7    resulted in the present situation.
H13 0550  2       In the light of the facts at hand, however, New
H13 0560  2    York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping
H13 0560 11    to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure
H13 0570  8    in the public interest".
H13 0580  1       The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence
H13 0580  7    its deliberations on the proposed C. + O.-B. + O. merger
H13 0590 12    on June 18. Obviously, the Interstate Commerce Commission
H13 0600  8    will not force the New York Central to further curtail
H13 0610  8    its commuter operations by giving undue competitive
H13 0620  5    advantages to the lines that wish to merge.
H13 0630  1       However, there is a more profound consideration
H13 0630  8    to this proposed merger than profit and loss. That
H13 0640  7    is, will it serve the long-range public interest?
H13 0650  3       For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully
H13 0660  3    planned, balanced and competitive railway system. We
H13 0670  2    must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will
H13 0670 11    help the commuter- the two-way B. + O.-C. + O. merger,
H13 0680 13    or the three-way New York Central-B. + O.-C. + O. merger.
H13 0690 11    Which will serve not only the best interest of the
H13 0700  9    stockholders, but the interests of all the traveling
H13 0710  5    public?
H13 0720  1    _MR. LINDSAY._
H13 0720  3       Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great
H13 0730  3    newspaper, the New York Times, on the occasion of a
H13 0730 13    major change in its top executive command.
H13 0740  6       Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished
H13 0750  4    publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is
H13 0760  3    fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution
H13 0760 13    to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement.
H13 0770  8    I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue
H13 0780  7    to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times.
H13 0790  7       Mr. Sulzberger's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil
H13 0800  6    E. Dryfoos, who is president of the New York Times
H13 0810  4    Co., and who has been with the Times since 1942. Mr.
H13 0820  2    Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees
H13 0820  9    that the high standards which have made the Times one
H13 0830 10    of the world's great newspapers will be maintained.
H13 0840  6       I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes,
H13 0850  6    a member of the Times staff since 1946, has been appointed
H13 0860  4    as editorial page editor. Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles
H13 0870  2    Merz, editor since 1938, who now becomes editor emeritus.
H13 0880  1       I should like at this time, Mr. Speaker, to pay
H13 0880 11    warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles
H13 0890  7    Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished
H13 0900  5    careers in American journalism.
H13 0910  1       My heartiest congratulations go to their successors,
H13 0910  8    Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes, who can be counted
H13 0920 10    upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New
H13 0930  7    York Times.
H13 0930  9       The people of the 17th District of New York, and
H13 0940  9    I as their Representative in Congress, take great pride
H13 0950  6    in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative
H13 0960  4    newspapers of the world.
H13 0970  1    _MR. STRATTON._
H13 0970  3       Mr. Speaker, in my latest newsletter to my constituents
H13 0980  1    I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba
H13 0980 11    as the only effective method of preventing continued
H13 0990  7    Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere
H13 1000  6    in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Yesterday, I had
H13 1010  4    the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the
H13 1020  3    U.S. News + World Report of May 8 which discussed this
H13 1030  1    type of action in more detail, including both its advantages
H13 1030 11    and its disadvantages.
H13 1040  2       Under leave to extend my remarks, I include the
H13 1050  2    relevant portion of my newsletter, together with the
H13 1050 10    text of the article from the U.S. News + World Report:
H13 1060  9    "
H13 1070  1    _YOUR CONGRESSMAN, SAMUEL S. STRATTON, REPORTS FROM
H13 1070  6    WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1961_
H13 1080  1       Cuban S.S.R.: Whatever may have been the setbacks
H13 1080  9    resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban
H13 1090  8    rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held
H13 1100  7    mainland last week, there was at least one positive
H13 1110  3    benefit, and that was the clear-cut revelation to the
H13 1120  1    whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into
H13 1120 10    a Russian-dominated military base.
H13 1130  3       In fact, one of the major reasons for the failure
H13 1140  2    of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been
H13 1140 11    a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba
H13 1150  8    has been getting this Russian military equipment. Somehow,
H13 1160  4    the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban
H13 1170  6    beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel
H13 1180  2    troops has brought home to all of us the stark, blunt
H13 1180 13    truth of what it means to have a Russian military base
H13 1190 11    90 miles away from home. Russian tanks and planes in
H13 1200  7    Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States,
H13 1210  4    violate the Monroe Doctrine, and threaten the security
H13 1220  2    of every other Latin American republic.
H13 1220  8       Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration
H13 1230  7    of Cuba was clear, President Kennedy announced we would
H13 1240  5    take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this,
H13 1250  4    even if we had to go it alone. But the Latin American
H13 1260  1    republics who have been rather inclined to drag their
H13 1260 10    feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly
H13 1270  8    last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American
H13 1280  7    Defense Board. For years the United States had been
H13 1290  6    trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative
H13 1300  3    from secret military talks. But it took the pictures
H13 1310  2    of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job. There
H13 1320  1    is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week.
H13 1320 11    You can see it, for example, in the extensive efforts
H13 1330  8    President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan
H13 1340  5    support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos;
H13 1345  3    efforts, as I see it, which are being directed, by
H13 1350 10    the way, toward support for future actions, not for
H13 1360  7    those already past.
H13 1360 10       What the next move will be only time, of course,
H13 1370 10    will tell. Personally, I think we ought to set up an
H13 1380  9    immediate naval blockade of Cuba. We simply can't tolerate
H13 1390  4    further Russian weapons, including the possibility
H13 1400  1    of long-range nuclear missiles, being located in Cuba.
H13 1400 10    Obviously, we can't stop them from coming in, however,
H13 1410  9    just by talk. A naval blockade would be thoroughly
H13 1420  5    in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would be a relatively
H13 1430  4    simple operation to carry out, and would bring an abrupt
H13 1440  2    end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere". @ "
H13 1440 10    #[FROM U.S. NEWS + WORLD REPORT, MAY 8, 1961]#
H13 1460  1    _NEXT FOR CUBA: AN ARMS BLOCKADE?_
H13 1460  4       Look at Castro now- cockier than ever with arms
H13 1470  3    and agents to threaten the Americas.
H13 1470  9       How can the United States act?
H13 1480  4       Blockade is one answer offered by experts. In it
H13 1490  3    they see a way to isolate Cuba, stop infiltration,
H13 1490 12    maybe finish Castro, too.
H13 1500  3       This is the question now facing President Kennedy:
H13 1510  2    How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and
H13 1510 14    to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere?
H13 1520  6       On April 25, the White House reported that a total
H13 1530  7    embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being
H13 1540  6    considered. Its aim: To undermine further Cuba's economy.
H13 1550  3    weaken Castro.
H13 1550  5       Another strategy- bolder and tougher- was also attracting
H13 1560  6    notice in Washington: a naval and air blockade to cut
H13 1570  6    Cuba off from the world, destroy Castro.
H13 1580  1       Blockade, in the view of military and civilian experts,
H13 1580 10    could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine. It could
H13 1590  8    halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies
H13 1600  5    now reaching Castro. It could stop Cuban re-export
H13 1610  4    of guns and propaganda materials to South America.
H13 1620  1    It would be the most severe reprisal, short of declared
H13 1620 11    war, that the United States could invoke against Castro.
H13 1630  7       It is the strategy of blockade, therefore, that
H13 1640  5    is suddenly at the center of attention of administration
H13 1650  3    officials, Members of Congress, officers in the Pentagon.
H13 1660  2    As a possible course of action, it also is the center
H13 1660 13    of debate and is raising many questions. Among these
H13 1670  9    questions:
H13 1680  1    _WHAT WOULD A CUBA BLOCKADE TAKE?_
H13 1680  5       Military experts say a tight naval blockade off
H13 1690  2    Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would
H13 1690 12    require two naval task forces, each built around an
H13 1700  9    aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes
H13 1710  7    and several destroyers.
H13 1710 10       The Navy, on April 25, announced it is bringing
H13 1720  9    back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean,
H13 1730  4    increasing to four the number of attack carriers in
H13 1740  4    the vicinity of Cuba. More than 36 other big Navy ships
H13 1750  2    are no less than a day's sailing time away.
H13 1750 11       To round out the blockading force, submarines would
H13 1760  7    be needed- to locate, identify and track approaching
H13 1770  4    vessels. Land-based radar would help with this task.
H13 1780  3    So would radar picket ships. A squadron of Navy jets
H13 1780 13    and another of long-range patrol planes would add support
H13 1790 10    to the carrier task forces.
H13 1800  3       Three requirements go with a blockade: It must be
H13 1810  2    proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough
H13 1810 10    to enforce it; and it must be enforced without discrimination.
H13 1820  9       Once these conditions of international law are met,
H13 1830  8    countries that try to run to blockade do so at their
H13 1840  8    own risk. Blockade runners can be stopped- by gunfire,
H13 1850  5    if necessary- searched and held, at least temporarily.
H13 1860  1    They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether
H13 1860 11    cargo should be confiscated.
H13 1870  4    _WHAT COULD A BLOCKADE ACCOMPLISH?_
H13 1880  1       Plenty, say the experts. In a broad sense, it would
H13 1880 10    reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist
H13 1890  5    interference in the Western Hemisphere. It could, by
H13 1900  4    avoiding direct intervention, provide a short-of-war
H13 1910  1    strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.
H13 1910  8       Primary target would be shipments of tanks, guns,
H13 1920  7    aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia
H13 1930  4    and Czechoslovakia. Shipments of arms from Western
H13 1940  1    countries could similarly be seized as contraband.
H13 1940  8    In a total blockade, action could also be taken against
H13 1950  7    ships bringing in chemicals, oils, textiles, and even
H13 1960  5    foodstuffs. At times, three ships a day from the Soviet
H13 1970  3    bloc are unloading in Cuban ports.
