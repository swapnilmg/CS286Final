K29 0010  1    Was it love? I had no doubt that it was. During the
K29 0010 13    rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster
K29 0020  7    casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves
K29 0030  5    was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions
K29 0040  3    of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation
K29 0050  1    and delight.
K29 0050  3    ##
K29 0050  4    Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power
K29 0060  4    to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow
K29 0060 14    than the breakup of camp, the packing away of my camp
K29 0070 11    uniforms, the severing of ties with the six or ten
K29 0080  8    people I had grown most to love in the world. In final
K29 0090  4    separation from them, in the railroad terminal across
K29 0100  1    the river from New York, I would nearly cry. My parents'
K29 0100 12    welcoming arms would seem woeful, inadequate, unwanted.
K29 0110  7    But that year was different, for just as the city,
K29 0120  7    in the form of my street clothes, had intruded upon
K29 0130  3    my mountain nights, so an essential part of the summer
K29 0140  1    gave promise of continuing into the fall: Jessica and
K29 0140 10    I, about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or
K29 0150  9    messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing
K29 0160  5    in cruelly distant boroughs, had agreed to correspond.
K29 0170  3       These letters became the center of my existence.
K29 0180  1    I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail
K29 0180 13    and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread
K29 0190 10    her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an
K29 0200  6    answer. My memory has catalogued for easy reference
K29 0210  2    and withdrawal the image of her pink, scented stationery
K29 0210 11    and the unsloped, almost printed configurations of
K29 0220  7    her neat, studious handwriting with which she invited
K29 0230  5    me to recall our summer, so many sentences beginning
K29 0240  2    with "Remember when ..."; and others concerning camp
K29 0250  2    friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood, and
K29 0250 10    news of her commencing again her piano lessons, her
K29 0260  7    private school, a visit to Boston to see her grandparents
K29 0270  6    and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough,
K29 0280  3    wounded, from the war in Europe.
K29 0280  9       In my letters I took on a personality that differed
K29 0290  8    from the self I knew in real life. Then epistolatory
K29 0300  4    me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting
K29 0310  1    cables and communiques, full of dash and wit and glamor,
K29 0310 11    quoting from the books I read, imitating the grand
K29 0320  9    styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose
K29 0330  6    special, after-school class I was enrolled. The letters
K29 0340  3    took their source from a stream of my imagination in
K29 0350  2    which I was transformed into a young man not unlike
K29 0350 12    my bunkmate Eliot Sands- he of the porch steps anecdotes-
K29 0360  7    who smoked cigarettes, performed the tango, wore fifty
K29 0370  6    dollar suits, and sneaked off into the dark with girls
K29 0380  5    to do unimaginable things with them. Like Eliot, in
K29 0390  2    my fantasies, I had a proud bearing and, with a skill
K29 0390 13    that was vaguely continental, I would lead Jessica
K29 0400  6    through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions
K29 0410  4    of my newest exploits, would guide her gently to the
K29 0420  3    night's climax which, in my dreams, was always represented
K29 0430  1    by our almost suffocating one another to death with
K29 0430 10    deep, moist kisses burning with love. The night after
K29 0440  7    reading her letter about her surgeon uncle- it must
K29 0450  3    have been late in September- I had a vision of myself
K29 0460  3    returned in ragged uniform from The Front, nearly dying,
K29 0470  1    my head bandaged and blooded, and Jessica bending over
K29 0470 10    me, the power of her love bringing me back to life.
K29 0480  9    For many nights afterward, the idea of her having been
K29 0490  6    so close to me in that imagined bed would return and
K29 0500  2    fill me with obscure and painful desires, would cause
K29 0500 11    me to lie awake in shame, tossing with irresolution,
K29 0510  7    longing to fall into a deep sleep.
K29 0520  2       The weeks went by, and the longer our separation
K29 0520 11    grew, the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies
K29 0530  9    became. They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer
K29 0540  9    and at the same time more hopeless, as if my adolescent
K29 0550  6    self knew that only torment would ever bring me the
K29 0560  4    courage to ask to see her again.
K29 0560 11       As it turned out, Jessica took matters into her
K29 0570  3    own hands. Having received permission to give a camp
K29 0580  5    reunion-Halloween party, she asked that I come and
K29 0590  1    be her date. I went and, mum and nervous, all but made
K29 0590 13    a fool of myself. Again among those jubilantly reunited
K29 0600  6    bunkmates, I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had
K29 0610  7    during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed
K29 0620  4    to be playing for effect, to be detached and unconcerned
K29 0630  1    with the girls who were properly our dates but about
K29 0630 11    whom, later, in the privacy of our bunks, we would
K29 0640  8    think in terms of the most elaborate romance. I remember
K29 0650  4    standing in a corner, watching Jessica act the hostess,
K29 0660  2    serving soft drinks to her guests. She was wearing
K29 0660 11    her dark hair in two, thick braids to attain an "American
K29 0670 10    Girl" effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween.
K29 0680  7    It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish, I was excited
K29 0690  5    to be with her, but I did not know how to express it.
K29 0700  4    Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous
K29 0710  1    letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my
K29 0710 10    flashy pages, out of my mind, and plant himself in
K29 0720  8    reality. It was late, we were playing kissing games,
K29 0730  3    and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of
K29 0740  2    the others. We blushed and were flustered, and it turned
K29 0740 12    out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek. The
K29 0750 10    kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile
K29 0760  7    had released in me all the remote, exciting premonitions
K29 0770  2    of lust, all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined
K29 0780  2    a truly consummated kiss would convey to me.
K29 0780 10       It was at that party that, finally overcoming my
K29 0790  8    timidity, inspired by tales only half-understood and
K29 0800  5    overheard among older boys, I asked Jessie to spend
K29 0810  3    New Year's Eve with me. Lovingly, she accepted, and
K29 0810 12    so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying
K29 0820 12    was, "You're amazing, you know"? Later, we agreed to
K29 0830  8    think of how we wished to spend that night. We would
K29 0840  7    write to one another and make a definite plan. She
K29 0850  3    was terribly pleased.
K29 0850  6       Among my school and neighborhood friends, during
K29 0860  3    the next months, I bragged and swaggered and pompously
K29 0870  2    described my impending date. But though I boasted and
K29 0870 11    gave off a dapper front, I was beneath it all frightened.
K29 0880 11    It would be the first time I had ever been completely
K29 0890  8    alone with a girl I loved. I had no idea of what subjects
K29 0900  8    one discussed when alone with a girl, or how one behaved:
K29 0910  5    Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing
K29 0920  3    the street? Should I bring along a corsage or send
K29 0930  1    one to her? Was it preferable to meet her at home or
K29 0930 13    in the city? Should I accompany her to the door of
K29 0940  9    her home, or should I ask to be invited in? In or out,
K29 0950  7    should I kiss her goodnight? All this was unknown to
K29 0960  4    me, and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most
K29 0970  1    important night of the year!
K29 0970  6       When in one letter Jessica informed me that her
K29 0980  4    father did not like the idea of her going out alone
K29 0990  1    on New Year's Eve, I knew for a moment an immense relief;
K29 0990 13    but the letter went on: she had cried, she had implored,
K29 1000 11    she had been miserable at his refusal, and finally
K29 1010  6    he had relented- and now how happy she was, how expectant!
K29 1020  5       Her optimism gave me heart. I forced confidence
K29 1030  2    into myself. I made inquiries, I read a book of etiquette.
K29 1040  1    In December I wrote her with authority that we would
K29 1040 11    meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor, a rendezvous
K29 1050 10    spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated.
K29 1060  5    We would attend a film and, later on, I stated, we
K29 1070  4    might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child's or
K29 1080  2    Toffenetti's for waffles. I set the hour of our meeting
K29 1080 12    for seven.
K29 1090  1    ##
K29 1090  2    At five o'clock that night it was already dark, and
K29 1090 12    behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as
K29 1100 10    a groom. I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted
K29 1110  5    suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels
K29 1120  4    like a devil's ears. My camp-made leather wallet, bulky
K29 1130  1    with twisted, raised stitches around the edges, I stuffed
K29 1130 10    with money I had been saving. Hatless, in an overcoat
K29 1140  9    of rough blue wool, I was given a proud farewell by
K29 1150  8    my mother and father, and I set out into the strangely
K29 1160  4    still streets of Brooklyn. I felt superior to the neighborhood
K29 1170  2    friends I was leaving behind, felt older than my years,
K29 1180  1    and was full of compliments for myself as I headed
K29 1180 11    into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers
K29 1190  7    out of that dull borough and into the unstable, tantalizing
K29 1200  5    excitement of Manhattan.
K29 1200  8       Times Square, when I ascended to it with my fellow
K29 1210 10    subway travellers (all dressed as if for a huge wedding
K29 1220  8    in a family of which we were all distant members),
K29 1230  2    was nearly impassable, the sidewalks swarming with
K29 1230  9    celebrants, with bundled up sailors and soldiers already
K29 1240  8    hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey.
K29 1250  7    Heavy-coated, severe-looking policemen sat astride
K29 1260  4    noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers
K29 1270  2    from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic.
K29 1270 11    The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm. The
K29 1280 10    giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the
K29 1290  7    first time since blackout regulations had been instituted,
K29 1300  3    and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that
K29 1310  1    victory was just around the corner. Cardboard noisemakers,
K29 1310  9    substitutes for the unavailable tin models, were being
K29 1320  8    hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards
K29 1330  5    along Broadway, and one's ears were continually serenaded
K29 1340  2    by the horns' rasps and bleats. An old gentlemen next
K29 1350  2    to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted
K29 1350 14    away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted
K29 1360  9    out, "V for Victory"! His neighbors cheered him on.
K29 1370  6    There was a great sense of camaraderie. How did one
K29 1380  5    join them? Where were they all walking to? Was I supposed
K29 1390  5    to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica?
K29 1400  1       It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed
K29 1400 11    me up among the other gallants who had established
K29 1410  6    the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch
K29 1420  5    their night of merrymaking. I looked over their faces
K29 1430  2    and felt a twinge: they all looked so much more knowing
K29 1430 13    than I. I looked away. I looked for Jessica to materialize
K29 1440 11    out of the clogging, curdling crowd and, as the time
K29 1450  8    passed and I waited, a fiend came to life beside me
K29 1460  6    and whispered in my ear: How was I planning to greet
K29 1470  3    Jessica? Where exactly would we go after the movie?
K29 1480  1    Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were
K29 1480 11    too long and we couldn't get in? Suppose I hadn't brought
K29 1490  8    along enough money? I felt for my wallet. Its thick,
K29 1500  8    substantial outline calmed me.
K29 1510  1       But when I saw that it was already ten past seven,
K29 1510 12    I began to wonder if something had gone wrong. Suppose
K29 1520  8    her father had changed his mind and had refused to
K29 1530  6    let her leave? Suppose at this very moment her father
K29 1540  3    was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans?
K29 1550  1    I grew uneasy. All about me there was a hectic interplay
K29 1550 12    of meetings taking place, like abrupt, jerky scenes
K29 1560  7    in old silent movies, joyous greetings and beginnings,
K29 1570  4    huggings and kissings, enthusiastic forays into the
K29 1580  3    festive night. Whole platoons were taking up new positions
K29 1580 12    on the steps, arriving and departing, while I stayed
K29 1590  9    glued, like a signpost, to one spot.
K29 1600  4       At 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the
K29 1610  3    steps, carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade
K29 1610 15    in front of the haberdashery store window next to the
K29 1620  9    entranceway, and as I watched them in their gaudy red
K29 1630  7    coats that nearly scraped the ground, their golden,
K29 1640  3    fringed epaulets and spic, red-visored caps, I suddenly
K29 1650  1    saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making
K29 1650  9    her way through the crowd. My heart almost stopped
K29 1660  7    beating.
