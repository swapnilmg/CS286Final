J50 0010  1       Unfortunately, however, and for reasons to be discussed
J50 0010  9    in the following chapter, no rate relationships can
J50 0020  7    be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all
J50 0030  5    or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs
J50 0040  2    in order to yield adequate revenues. And this fact
J50 0040 11    may explain some of the disagreements among the experts
J50 0050  8    as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment
J50 0060  5    of total costs among different units of service. One
J50 0070  4    such disagreement, which will receive attention in
J50 0080  1    this next chapter, concerns the question whether rates
J50 0080  9    for different kinds of service, in order to avoid the
J50 0090  8    attribute of discrimination, must be made directly
J50 0100  4    proportional to marginal costs, or whether they should
J50 0110  2    be based instead on differences in marginal costs.
J50 0110 10    Here, the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.
J50 0120 11    #TWO MAJOR TYPES OF FULLY DISTRIBUTED COST ANALYSIS#
J50 0130  6    _1. THE DOUBLE-STEP TYPE_
J50 0140  1       Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly
J50 0150  8    to define "relative costs", the above exposition of
J50 0160  5    fully distributed costing goes about as far as one
J50 0170  4    can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the
J50 0170 13    practice. For more explicit expositions, one must distinguish
J50 0180  8    different types of analyses. By all means the most
J50 0190  8    important distinction is that between those total-cost
J50 0200  5    apportionments which superimpose a distribution of
J50 0210  2    admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of
J50 0210  9    incremental or marginal costs, and those other apportionments
J50 0220  8    which recognize no difference between true cost allocation
J50 0230  6    and mere total-cost distribution.
J50 0240  1       The first, or double-step, type might also be called
J50 0240 11    the "railroad type" because of its application to railroads
J50 0250  8    (and other transportation agencies) by the Cost Section
J50 0260  7    of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Cost Section
J50 0270  5    distinguishes between (directly) variable costs and
J50 0280  4    constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter.
J50 0290  2    The variable costs alone are assigned to the different
J50 0290 11    units of freight traffic as representing "long-run
J50 0300  8    out-of-pocket costs"- a term with a meaning here not
J50 0310 10    distinctly different from that of the economist's "long-run
J50 0320  5    marginal costs". There remains a residue of total costs,
J50 0330  4    or total "revenue requirements" which, since it is
J50 0340  3    found to behave as if it were constant over substantial
J50 0340 13    variations in traffic density, is strictly unallocable
J50 0350  7    on a cost-finding basis. Nevertheless, because the
J50 0360  4    Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of
J50 0370  4    a distribution of total costs, it has apportioned this
J50 0370 13    residue, which it sometimes calls "burden", among the
J50 0380  8    units of carload traffic on a basis (partly ton, partly
J50 0390  8    ton-mile) which is concededly quite arbitrary from
J50 0400  4    the standpoint of cost determination. In recent years,
J50 0410  2    this burden (which includes allowances for revenue
J50 0410  9    deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload
J50 0420 10    freight traffic!) has amounted to about one third of
J50 0430  8    those total revenue requirements which the carload
J50 0440  4    freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet.
J50 0450  2       Since this book is concerned only incidentally with
J50 0450 10    railroad rates, it will not attempt to analyze the
J50 0460  9    methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce
J50 0470  5    Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned
J50 0480  4    residue costs. Suffice it to say that the usefulness
J50 0490  1    of the latter apportionment is questionable. But in
J50 0490  9    any event, full credit should be given to the Cost
J50 0500  9    Section for its express and overt recognition of a
J50 0510  5    vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost
J50 0520  1    analyses: namely, that between a cost allocation designed
J50 0520  9    to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response
J50 0530  9    to changes in rates of output of different classes
J50 0540  6    of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment which
J50 0550  2    somehow spreads among the classes and units of service
J50 0560  1    even those costs that are strictly unallocable from
J50 0560  9    the standpoint of specific cost determination.
J50 0570  5    _2. THE SINGLE-STEP TYPE_
J50 0570 10       We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost
J50 0580  9    analysis which, unlike the "railroad type", draws no
J50 0590  4    distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment:
J50 0600  2    the single-step type. It might be called the "public
J50 0610  1    utility" type because of the considerable use to which
J50 0610 10    it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases.
J50 0620 10    Here no attempt is made, first to determine out-of-pocket
J50 0630  8    or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these
J50 0640  3    costs "reasonably distributed" residues of total costs.
J50 0650  2    Instead, all of the total costs are treated as variable
J50 0650 12    costs, although these costs are divided into costs
J50 0660  8    that are deemed to be functions of different variables.
J50 0670  5    Moreover, whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission
J50 0680  2    parlance "variable cost" means a cost deemed to vary
J50 0690  2    in direct proportion to changes in rate of output,
J50 0690 11    in the type of analysis now under review "variable
J50 0700  7    cost" has been used more broadly, so as to cover costs
J50 0710  7    which, while a function of some one variable (such
J50 0720  2    as output of energy, or number of customers), are not
J50 0720 12    necessarily a linear function.
J50 0730  4       As already noted in an earlier paragraph, the more
J50 0740  4    familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility
J50 0750  2    systems divide the total costs among a number of major
J50 0750 12    classes of service, such as residential, commercial,
J50 0760  7    industrial power, street lighting, etc. This "grand
J50 0770  5    division" permits many costs to be assigned in their
J50 0780  4    entirety to some one class, such as street lighting,
J50 0790  1    or at least to be excluded completely from some important
J50 0790 11    class or classes. High-tension industrial power service,
J50 0800  6    for example, would not be charged with any share of
J50 0810  7    the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension
J50 0820  4    distribution lines. But the major portions of the total
J50 0830  1    costs of a utility business are common or joint to
J50 0830 11    all, or nearly all, classes of customers; and these
J50 0840  7    costs must somehow be apportioned among the various
J50 0850  4    classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among
J50 0860  1    the units of service in order to report unit costs
J50 0860 11    than can serve as tentative measures of reasonable
J50 0870  6    rates.
J50 0870  7       The general basis on which these common costs are
J50 0880  6    assigned to differently measured units of service will
J50 0890  4    be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem
J50 0900  1    of an electric-utility cost analysis. But before turning
J50 0900 10    to this example, we must distinguish two subtypes of
J50 0910  8    analysis, both of which belong to the single-step type
J50 0920  6    rather than to the double-step type.
J50 0930  1       In the first subtype, the analyst (following the
J50 0930  9    practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect)
J50 0940  6    distributes both total operating costs and total annual
J50 0950  5    capital costs (including an allowance for "cost of
J50 0960  3    capital" or "fair rate of return") among the different
J50 0970  1    classes and units of service. Here, an apportionment,
J50 0970  9    say, of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential
J50 0980  7    service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps
J50 0990  5    6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed
J50 1000  3    to have been devoted to the service of the residential
J50 1000 13    consumers.
J50 1010  1       But in the second subtype, which I take to be the
J50 1010 12    one more frequently applied, only the operating expenses
J50 1020  8    and not the "cost of capital" or "fair return" are
J50 1030  7    apportioned directly among the various classes of service.
J50 1040  5    To be sure, the capital investments in (or, alternatively,
J50 1050  3    the estimated "fair values" of) the plant and equipment
J50 1060  2    are apportioned among the different classes, as are
J50 1060 10    also the gross revenues received from the sales of
J50 1070  8    the different services. But any resulting excess of
J50 1080  5    revenues received from a given class of service over
J50 1090  2    the operating costs imputed to this class is reported
J50 1090 11    as a "return" realized on the capital investment attributed
J50 1100  7    to the same service. Thus, during any given year (a)
J50 1110  8    if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000,
J50 1120  4    (b) if the operating expenses imputed to this class
J50 1130  4    of service come to $5,000,000, and (c) if the net investment
J50 1140  1    in (or value of) the plant and equipment deemed devoted
J50 1140 11    to this service amounts to $30,000,000, the cost analyst
J50 1150  8    will report that residential service, in the aggregate,
J50 1160  5    has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent.
J50 1170  6    Other services will show different rates of return,
J50 1180  1    some probably much lower and some higher.
J50 1180  8       There are obvious reasons of convenience for this
J50 1190  6    practice of excluding "cost of capital" from the direct
J50 1200  4    apportionment of annual costs among the different classes
J50 1210  2    of service- notably, the avoidance of the controversial
J50 1210 10    question what rate of return should be held to constitute
J50 1220 10    "cost of capital" or "fair rate of return". But the
J50 1230  8    practice is likely to be misleading, since it may seem
J50 1240  6    to support a conclusion that, as long as the revenues
J50 1250  4    from any class of service cover the imputed operating
J50 1260  1    expenses plus some return on capital investment, however
J50 1260  9    low, the rates of charge for this service are compensatory.
J50 1270  9    Needless to say, any such inference would be quite
J50 1280  6    unwarranted.
J50 1280  7       For the reason just suggested, I shall assume the
J50 1290  6    use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost
J50 1300  2    apportionment in the following simplified example.
J50 1300  8    That is to say, an allowance for "cost of capital"
J50 1310 10    will be assumed to be included directly in the cost
J50 1320  7    apportionment.
J50 1320  8    #THREE-PART ANALYSIS OF THE COSTS OF AN ELECTRIC UTILITY
J50 1330  8    BUSINESS#
J50 1330  9    In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully
J50 1340  7    apportioned cost analysis, let us assume the application
J50 1350  4    of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying
J50 1360  2    a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation
J50 1370  1    plant. Let us also assume the existence of only one
J50 1370 11    class or type of service, all of which is supplied
J50 1380  8    at the same voltage, phase, etc. to residential, commercial,
J50 1390  4    and industrial customers. This latter assumption will
J50 1400  3    permit us to center attention on the most controversial
J50 1410  1    aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the
J50 1410  9    distinction among costs that are functions of outputs
J50 1420  7    of the same service measured along different dimensions.
J50 1430  3       Since the company under review is supplying what
J50 1440  2    we are here regarding as only one kind of service,
J50 1440 12    we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment
J50 1450  9    would be very simple; indeed, that it would be limited
J50 1460  8    to a finding of the total annual operating and capital
J50 1470  4    costs of the business, followed by a calculation of
J50 1480  2    this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour
J50 1480 12    of consumption. In fact, however, the problem is not
J50 1490  8    so simple. For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour
J50 1500  6    would ignore the fact that many of these costs are
J50 1510  3    not a function of kilowatt-hour output (or consumption)
J50 1510 12    of energy. A recognition of multiple cost functions
J50 1520  8    is therefore required.
J50 1530  1       The simplest division, and the one most frequently
J50 1530  9    used (with subdivisions) in gas and electric rate cases,
J50 1540  8    is a threefold division of the total operating and
J50 1550  6    capital costs into "customer costs", "energy" or "volumetric
J50 1560  4    costs", and "demand" or "capacity" costs. If this threefold
J50 1570  5    division of costs were to have its counterpart in the
J50 1580  3    actual rates of charge for service, as it actually
J50 1580 12    does have in some rates, there would result a three-part
J50 1590 11    rate for any one class of service. For example, the
J50 1600  7    monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the
J50 1610  5    sum of a $1 customer charge, a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours
J50 1620  3    of energy at 2@ per kilowatt-hour, and a $2 charge
J50 1620 14    for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month
J50 1630 10    at the rate of $1 per kilowatt- a total bill of $8
J50 1640  8    for that month. But our present interest lies in the
J50 1650  4    measurement of costs of service, and only indirectly
J50 1660  1    in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these
J50 1660 13    costs. Let us therefore consider each of the three
J50 1670  8    types of cost in turn, recognizing that this simplified
J50 1680  4    classification is used only for illustrative purposes;
J50 1690  2    costs actually vary in much more complex ways.
J50 1700  1    _1. THE CUSTOMER COSTS_
J50 1700  3       These are those operating and capital costs found
J50 1700 11    to vary with number of customers regardless, or almost
J50 1710  9    regardless, of power consumption. Included as a minimum
J50 1720  6    are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever
J50 1730  5    other expenses the company must incur in taking on
J50 1740  3    another consumer. These minimum costs may come to $1
J50 1740 12    per month, more or less, for residential and small
J50 1750  8    commercial customers, although they are substantially
J50 1760  4    higher for large industrial users, who require more
J50 1770  2    costly connections and metering devices. While costs
J50 1770  9    on this order are sometimes separately charged for
J50 1780  7    in residential and commercial rates, in the form of
J50 1790  6    a mere "service charge", they are more frequently wholly
J50 1800  3    or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles
J50 1810  1    the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity
J50 1810 12    with no further payment.
J50 1820  2       But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost
J50 1830  1    imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent
J50 1830  9    practice of including, not just those costs that can
J50 1840  9    be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit
J50 1850  6    of specific customers but also a substantial fraction
J50 1860  2    of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the
J50 1860 11    secondary (low-voltage) distribution system- a fraction
J50 1870  7    equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical
J50 1880  6    system of minimum capacity.
