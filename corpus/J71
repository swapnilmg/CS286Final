J71 0010  1       Thus, the three main categories of antisubmarine
J71 0010  8    warfare operations are defense of shipping, defense
J71 0020  6    of naval forces, and area defense. The last category
J71 0030  4    overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near
J71 0040  2    terminals and bases.
J71 0040  5       To effect these operations, five elements exist
J71 0050  2    (1) surface, (2) air, (3) mines, (4) submarine, and
J71 0050 11    (5) fixed installations. Surface forces have been used
J71 0060  8    to provide defense zones around naval and merchant
J71 0070  6    ship formations, air to furnish area surveillance,
J71 0080  2    and mines for protection of limited areas. Submarines
J71 0080 10    and shore installations are new elements. The submarine
J71 0090  8    now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly
J71 0100  6    in denying enemy access to ocean areas. Fixed installations
J71 0110  5    offer possibilities for area detection. Mine warfare
J71 0120  3    is being reoriented against submarine targets.
J71 0130  1       A sixth element, not always considered, is intelligence.
J71 0130  9    It includes operational intelligence of the enemy and
J71 0140  7    knowledge of the environment. Operational intelligence
J71 0150  3    presumably will be available from our national intelligence
J71 0160  3    agencies; intelligence on the environment will come
J71 0170  2    from the recently augmented program in oceanography.
J71 0170  9    The major postwar development is the certainty that
J71 0180  7    these elements should not be considered singly but
J71 0190  4    in combination and as being mutually supporting.
J71 0200  1    #NECESSITY FOR AN OVER-ALL CONCEPT#
J71 0200  7    Thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut.
J71 0210  7    Proponents of single elements tend to ensure predominance
J71 0220  4    of that element without determining if it is justified,
J71 0230  1    and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous
J71 0230 10    proponents has assumed the greatest importance. Consequently,
J71 0240  7    air, surface, and submarine elements overshadow the
J71 0250  6    mine, fixed installations, and intelligence. These
J71 0260  4    have sought more and more of what they have. Each seems
J71 0270  3    to strive for elimination of the necessity for the
J71 0270 12    others. This, despite postwar experience demonstrating
J71 0280  6    that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting.
J71 0290  4    Thus, the most productive areas are not necessarily
J71 0300  3    the most stressed. This is stated to emphasize the
J71 0300 12    necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense,
J71 0310  9    one which would provide positions of relative importance
J71 0320  6    to ASW elements based on projected potentialities.
J71 0330  3    Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can
J71 0340  2    be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward
J71 0340  9    a common objective. An over-all concept would have
J71 0350  8    other advantages. It would allow presentation to the
J71 0360  5    public of a unified approach. Now the problem is presented
J71 0370  3    piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily. While one
J71 0375  1    element is announcing progress, another is delineating
J71 0380  7    its problems. The result can only be confusion in the
J71 0390  8    public mind. A unified concept can serve as a guide
J71 0400  6    to budgeting and, if public support is gained, will
J71 0410  1    command Congressional support. Industry's main criticism
J71 0410  7    of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot
J71 0420  8    determine where any one company or industry can apply
J71 0430  7    its skills and know-how. Lacking guidance, industry
J71 0440  2    picks its own areas. The result, coupled with the salesmanship
J71 0450  1    for which American industry is famous, is considerable
J71 0450  9    expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas.
J71 0460  8    An over-all concept will guide industry where available
J71 0470  6    talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends.
J71 0480  3    Therefore, a broad concept of over-all submarine defense
J71 0490  2    is needed for co-ordination of the Navy's efforts,
J71 0490 11    for a logical presentation to the public, for industry's
J71 0500  7    guidance, and as a basis for a program to the Congress.
J71 0510  8    #PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN AN OVER-ALL CONCEPT#
J71 0520  2    That which follows will be a discussion of principles
J71 0530  1    and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine
J71 0530 11    warfare. Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines
J71 0540  7    in the world, divided between her various fleets. Some
J71 0550  6    are also in Albania and others are on loan to Egypt.
J71 0560  6    Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly
J71 0570  1    become Communist can furnish bases. Communist target
J71 0570  8    areas can be assumed, but there is no certainty that
J71 0580  9    such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions. Attack
J71 0590  5    can come from almost any direction against many locations.
J71 0600  3    Logically, then, the first principle of the plan must
J71 0610  2    be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical
J71 0610 12    area.
J71 0620  1       It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed
J71 0620 11    while building, at bases, in transit, and on station.
J71 0630  9    Destruction of the enemy's building and base complex,
J71 0640  5    however, requires attacks on enemy territory, which
J71 0650  3    is possible only in event of all-out hostilities. In
J71 0660  1    transit or on station, it may not be possible to attack
J71 0660 12    the submarines until commission of an overt act. The
J71 0670  8    Communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short
J71 0680  3    of general war and will do so whenever it is to their
J71 0690  3    advantage. Therefore the second principle of the plan
J71 0690 11    must be that, while providing for all-out hostilities,
J71 0700  8    its effectiveness is not dependent on general war.
J71 0710  6       Antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between
J71 0720  3    large opposing forces, with the decision a result of
J71 0730  2    a single battle. It is a war of attrition, of single
J71 0730 13    actions, of an exchange of losses. This exchange must
J71 0740  9    result in our ending up with some effective units.
J71 0750  5    Initially, having fewer units of some elements- especially
J71 0760  4    submarines- than the opponent, our capabilities need
J71 0770  1    to be sufficiently greater than theirs, so that the
J71 0770 10    exchange will be in our favor. Therefore, the third
J71 0780  8    principle of the plan must be that it does not depend
J71 0790  5    for effectiveness on engagement by the same types,
J71 0800  1    unless at an assured favorable exchange rate.
J71 0800  8       The submarine has increased its effectiveness by
J71 0810  6    several orders of magnitude since World War II. Its
J71 0820  5    speed has increased, it operates at increasingly greater
J71 0830  2    depths, its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited,
J71 0830  9    and it will become even more silent. The next developments
J71 0840 10    will probably be in weaponry. The missile can gradually
J71 0850  8    be expected to replace the torpedo. As detection ranges
J71 0860  5    increase, weapons will be developed to attack other
J71 0870  3    submarines and surface craft at these ranges. Therefore,
J71 0880  1    the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide
J71 0880 12    for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent.
J71 0890  6       No element can accomplish the total objective of
J71 0900  5    submarine defense. Some elements support the others,
J71 0920  1    but all have limitations. Some limitations of one element
J71 0930  1    can be compensated for by a capability of another.
J71 0930 10    Elements used in combination will increase the over-all
J71 0940  8    capability more than the sum of the capabilities of
J71 0950  5    the individual elements. Therefore, the plan's fifth
J71 0960  2    principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities
J71 0960 11    of all elements in combination.
J71 0970  5       Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be
J71 0980  4    solved by sufficient forces. Numbers would be astronomical
J71 0990  1    and current fiscal policies make this an impractical
J71 0990  9    solution. Shipbuilding, aircraft procurement, and weapon
J71 1000  6    programs indicate that there will not be enough of
J71 1010  7    anything. Therefore, any measures taken in peacetime
J71 1020  3    which will decrease force requirements in war will
J71 1020 11    contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur.
J71 1030  7    Therefore, the sixth principle of the plan must be
J71 1040  7    that it concentrate on current measures which will
J71 1050  3    reduce future force requirements.
J71 1050  7       The world is constantly changing; what was new yesterday
J71 1060  6    is obsolescent today. The seventh principle of the
J71 1070  5    plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough to
J71 1080  2    allow for technological breakthroughs, scientific progress,
J71 1080  8    and changes in world conditions.
J71 1090  5    #SUPPORTING ELEMENTS IN ASW OPERATIONS#
J71 1100  1    To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine
J71 1100 13    defense has been demonstrated, the mission has been
J71 1110  8    stated, broad principles delineating its content laid
J71 1120  5    down, and the supporting elements listed. Before considering
J71 1130  3    these elements in more detail, an additional requirement
J71 1140  2    should be stated. Large area coverage will accomplish
J71 1140 10    all other tasks. Therefore, because reduction in tasks
J71 1150  8    results in reduction of forces required, the plan should
J71 1160  7    provide for expanding area coverage. But it must be
J71 1170  5    remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically.
J71 1180  2    Consequently, the system giving area coverage (if such
J71 1190  1    coverage is less than world wide) must be flexible
J71 1190 10    and hence at least partially mobile. Since effective
J71 1200  5    area coverage appears fairly remote, the requirement
J71 1210  3    can be borne in mind while considering the elements:
J71 1220  1    air, surface, sub-surface, fixed installations, mines,
J71 1220  8    and intelligence. These are arranged approximately
J71 1230  5    in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents
J71 1240  4    but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope
J71 1250  4    that the true order of importance will result.
J71 1250 12    ##
J71 1250 13    Intelligence, as used herein, will include information
J71 1260  7    on possible opponents and on the environment which
J71 1270  7    can affect operations. These can be referred to as
J71 1280  5    operational intelligence and environmental intelligence.
J71 1290  1    In submarine defense these must have maximum stress.
J71 1290  9    Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning,
J71 1300  6    greatly reduce force requirements, and increase tactical
J71 1310  4    effectiveness. Environmental intelligence is just as
J71 1320  4    important. The ocean presently co-operates with the
J71 1330  1    target. Full knowledge of the science of oceanography
J71 1330  9    can bring the environment to our side, resulting in
J71 1340  7    an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics,
J71 1350  4    a decrease in enemy capabilities, and the development
J71 1360  1    of methods of capitalizing on the environment. Therefore,
J71 1360  9    improved intelligence will result in reduced force
J71 1370  7    requirements and, as it supports all other elements,
J71 1380  6    rates a top priority. Gathering intelligence is important,
J71 1390  3    but of equal importance is its translation into usable
J71 1400  2    form.
J71 1400  3       A program is needed to translate the results of
J71 1400 12    oceanographic research into tactical and operating
J71 1410  6    instructions. Approaching this problem on a statistical
J71 1420  6    basis is invalid, because the opponent has the same
J71 1430  4    sources available and will be encountered not under
J71 1440  1    average conditions, but under the conditions most advantageous
J71 1440  9    to him. Therefore, the on-the-scene commander must
J71 1450  8    have detailed operating instructions based on measurement
J71 1460  5    of conditions, in the area, at the time of encounter.
J71 1470  3    All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage
J71 1480  1    then. Temperature, wind, oxygen content, depth, bottom
J71 1480  8    character, and animal life are the chief environmental
J71 1490  7    variables. There may be others. Variations in sound
J71 1500  4    velocity should be measured rather than temperature,
J71 1510  1    because more of the variables would be encompassed.
J71 1510  9    These variations must eventually be measured horizontally
J71 1520  6    as well as vertically. Progress in predicting water
J71 1530  5    conditions is encouraging, but little guidance is available
J71 1540  4    to the man at sea on the use of such information. A
J71 1550  2    concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data
J71 1550 10    useful on the spot.
J71 1560  3    ##
J71 1560  4    Mine warfare has in the past been directed against
J71 1570  1    surface targets. By its nature it has always been of
J71 1570 11    great psychological advantage and small efforts have
J71 1580  6    required considerably greater counter-efforts. Mines
J71 1590  4    are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets.
J71 1600  2    They are still considered to be for use in restricted
J71 1600 12    waters, however, and targets must come within a few
J71 1610  9    yards of them. Mines need to be recognized as a major
J71 1620  8    element in anti-submarine warfare employment, extended
J71 1630  2    to deep water, and have their effective area per unit
J71 1640  1    increased. Mines can be used to deny access to great
J71 1640 11    areas; they are difficult to counter, cost little to
J71 1650  8    maintain until required, and can be put into place
J71 1660  6    quickly. A most attractive feature is that detection
J71 1670  1    and attack are combined in a single package. Effective
J71 1670 10    employment will reduce force requirements.
J71 1680  5       For example, effective mine barriers from Florida
J71 1690  4    to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from Cuba to
J71 1700  3    Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense,
J71 1710  1    inshore patrol, convoy escort, shipping control, and
J71 1710  8    mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico. More extended
J71 1720  8    systems, covering all passage into the Caribbean, would
J71 1730  5    free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico from the
J71 1740  3    previously listed requirements. Systems covering the
J71 1740  9    Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts
J71 1750  9    of the United States are not impossible. Such mine
J71 1760  7    defense systems could permit concentration of mobile
J71 1770  3    forces in the open oceans with consequent increase
J71 1780  1    in the probability of success. The advantages inherent
J71 1780  9    in mine warfare justify as great an importance for
J71 1790  7    this element as is accorded any of the other elements.
J71 1800  5    ##
J71 1800  6    Fixed installations are increasingly advocated as the
J71 1810  4    problem of area defense emerges. The proponents are
J71 1820  2    scientific and technical men who exercise considerable
J71 1820  9    influence on their military counterparts. Systems which
J71 1830  7    detect submarines over wide areas are attractive, although
J71 1840  6    they can be only "burglar alarms". Mobile forces are
J71 1850  4    required to localize and attack detected targets, since
J71 1860  2    the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target.
J71 1860 11    Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically.
J71 1870  7    In an over-all ASW concept, dependence on and effort
J71 1880  7    expended for such systems should be limited to those
J71 1890  6    with proven capabilities. No general installation should
J71 1900  2    be made until a model installation has been proved
J71 1900 11    and its maximum capability determined. In addition,
J71 1910  7    proposals for fixed installations should be carefully
J71 1920  4    weighed against a counterpart mobile system. For fixed
J71 1930  4    installations will always lack the flexibility that
J71 1940  1    should be inherent in naval systems.
J71 1940  7    ##
J71 1940  8    The submarine has become increasingly attractive as
J71 1950  4    an antisubmarine weapon system. It operates in its
J71 1960  3    target's environment, and any advantage gained therefrom
J71 1970  1    by the target is shared by the attacker. But the submarine
J71 1970 12    is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger
J71 1980  8    of being ambushed.
