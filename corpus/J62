J62 0010  1       Those whom I wish to address with this letter are
J62 0010 11    for the most part unknown to me. It may well be that,
J62 0020 10    when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last
J62 0030  5    spring, you were living and working close to the places
J62 0040  4    we saw and the streets we walked. As American artists,
J62 0050  1    it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet
J62 0050 13    artists as possible. This letter might not have been
J62 0060  8    necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you
J62 0070  7    been more successful. Even though we did not see many
J62 0080  3    of your faces, it appears now quite evident that a
J62 0080 13    considerable number of your profession heard, from
J62 0090  7    those whom we had the fortune to encounter, that we
J62 0100  5    had been in your midst. I am very pleased that quite
J62 0110  2    a number of you found ways to communicate to me your
J62 0110 13    desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in
J62 0120  8    the U.S.S.R. I can well understand your curiosity.
J62 0130  6    We, ourselves, are always eager to know how others
J62 0140  5    feel about us and the way in which we live. it is my
J62 0150  2    hope that this written message and report will reach
J62 0150 11    you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet
J62 0160  8    Artists.
J62 0160  9       There should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore
J62 0170  8    the intent of this letter. Pozzatti and I endeavored
J62 0180  4    earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice
J62 0190  2    that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes. The
J62 0190 12    time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle
J62 0200  9    me to pose as an expert on anything I saw. Too much
J62 0210  7    damage is done by "experts" who have spent even less
J62 0220  5    time, if any at all, in the U.S.S.R.
J62 0240  1       Nevertheless I consider it reasonable, because of
J62 0240  8    my commitment as an artist, to assume that the rights
J62 0250  9    and responsibilities of creative individuals are related
J62 0260  4    to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political
J62 0270  3    interests. If this attitude is seriously questioned
J62 0280  1    in the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily follow
J62 0280 10    that the majority of the society in which I live is
J62 0290  9    too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical
J62 0300  5    as well as aesthetic point of view. It is a matter
J62 0310  3    of some disappointment to me that still many of my
J62 0310 13    own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any
J62 0320  7    symbolic significance to the plight of a minority,
J62 0330  5    such as artists, in any social order. I encountered
J62 0340  1    many questions and great interest upon my return from
J62 0340 10    the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience.
J62 0350  7    That which I found most profound and most disturbing
J62 0360  5    appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction. Almost
J62 0370  2    as if I were talking about something quite unreal.
J62 0370 11    Apparently this is not the time and the climate in
J62 0380 10    which people will listen objectively, or at least
J62 0390  5    dispassionately,
J62 0390  6    to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies
J62 0400  6    a good deal of their waking moments. Personal predispositions
J62 0410  2    tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice as well.
J62 0420  3    I cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of
J62 0420 13    a somewhat unusual travelogue. I am equally impatient
J62 0430  7    with the shrug of the shoulder, shake of the head of
J62 0440  7    those who no longer care because they have known it
J62 0450  4    for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who
J62 0450 13    are romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word
J62 0460 10    "Revolution"; the belligerent denunciations by the
J62 0470  6    sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache
J62 0480  7    wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons.
J62 0490  2    Difficult as it may have been at times, Pozzatti and
J62 0490 12    I saw enough, talked to enough artists, historians
J62 0500  7    and others to realize that the issue is quite clear.
J62 0510  7    Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity;
J62 0520  3    they are small in number and their contribution is
J62 0520 12    not immediately decisive in everyday life. By themselves
J62 0530  8    they may not be able to save the life on this planet,
J62 0540 10    but without them there would be very little left worth
J62 0550  6    saving.
J62 0550  7       It cannot be said that our very first day in the
J62 0560  6    Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one. On that
J62 0570  3    cold, but bright, April day we were guests of your
J62 0570 13    government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to
J62 0580  9    witness the poeple's celebration for Yuri Gagarin and
J62 0590  5    later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive
J62 0600  3    reception for him in one of the impressive palaces
J62 0610  1    of the Kremlin. If we thus spent our very first day
J62 0610 12    in the midst of a large number of your people honoring
J62 0620  8    a new hero and a great national achievement, our last
J62 0630  4    day, to us at least, was equally impressive and very
J62 0640  2    moving, even though the crowds were absent and there
J62 0640 11    was almost complete silence. We stood under a gigantic
J62 0650  8    tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow
J62 0660  5    looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian
J62 0670  3    poet and writer who cherished the love for his country
J62 0670 13    to the point of foregoing the highest international
J62 0680  8    honor. The grave, about half-way between his home and
J62 0690  7    the blue turrets of a small church, rose above the
J62 0700  4    forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of
J62 0700 12    green, the sounds of birds, the silence of other graves
J62 0710 10    and the casual paths through small forests. Just yesterday
J62 0720  7    we had met and talked with a living writer, a contemporary
J62 0730  6    of the dead poet, who is known for his ability of manipulating
J62 0740  4    his ideas and his craft more advantageously. But today
J62 0750  3    we were aware of only two men. One had taken a flight
J62 0750 15    into uncharted space, in the service of science, to
J62 0760  9    return as a living hero. The other had assumed the
J62 0770  6    right to explore the equally uncharted space of the
J62 0780  4    human spirit. The flowers on his grave attested to
J62 0780 13    the fact that he as well was somebody's hero.
J62 0790  9       These two recollections form the frame around a
J62 0800  6    series of experiences and sights which, to me at least,
J62 0810  5    symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as
J62 0810 14    ethical conflict between materialism and humanism.
J62 0820  6    A struggle that is being waged all over the world in
J62 0830  8    the half-light of disinterest. The prevalent opinion
J62 0840  3    which we encountered in a variety of expressions in
J62 0850  1    your country denied not only the existence of this
J62 0850 10    conflict but it was elaborated even further with an
J62 0860  6    incredible semantic dexterity. The socialist environment,
J62 0870  2    it was stated, had cross-fertilized these two extreme
J62 0880  1    seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit.
J62 0880 12    When I speculated on one such occasion that the new
J62 0890  8    growth, like other mutations, might be unable to propagate,
J62 0900  6    I was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice.
J62 0910  3    I could not bring myself to answer that "some of my
J62 0920  3    best friends are non-propagating mules".
J62 0920  9       This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little
J62 0930  7    time to get used to. After a while we were perhaps
J62 0940  4    less surprised, but still puzzled, when a friendly
J62 0950  1    discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most
J62 0950 10    irrelevant and illogical comparisons. A chance remark
J62 0960  6    about Lenin's sealed train brought the rejoinder that
J62 0970  5    this was a myth akin to George Washington's cherry
J62 0980  2    tree. Theories of the behavior pattern of population
J62 0980 10    masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning
J62 0990  7    the motion-pattern of gaseous masses. No wonder that
J62 1000  7    Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering
J62 1010  3    the real purpose of our presence, namely, Cultural
J62 1020  1    Exchange.
J62 1020  2       Typical of such an experience was the occasion of
J62 1030  2    a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of
J62 1030 11    the Union of Soviet Artists. We had looked forward
J62 1040  8    to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with
J62 1050  5    a number of Moscow's artists. Instead, we became involved
J62 1060  4    in a series of friendly, but overly formal, welcoming
J62 1070  1    addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in
J62 1070 12    kind. The terms of friendship, understanding, cooperation,
J62 1080  5    etc., tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant
J62 1090  6    and indiscriminate use. I can only hope that the continuing
J62 1100  5    exchange of groups and individuals between our countries
J62 1110  3    will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion.
J62 1120  1    The presiding female functionary, of massive proportions
J62 1120  8    and forbidding appearance, initially did not contribute
J62 1130  6    to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number
J62 1140  7    of dignified gentlemen representing the arts. It was
J62 1150  5    only after we had responded, with what I fear were
J62 1160  1    similar cliches, that she went into action by questioning
J62 1160 10    our desire for friendship and understanding with a
J62 1170  7    challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the
J62 1180  5    U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos. She retreated by
J62 1190  3    leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting
J62 1190 12    might well terminate right then and there. Unfortunately
J62 1200  8    she returned later, just as I had taken advantage of
J62 1210  8    the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that
J62 1220  5    perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange
J62 1230  1    Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in
J62 1230 11    Russia, with Social Realism regaining dominance in
J62 1240  7    the U.S. This gave her an opportunity to ring down
J62 1250  8    the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should
J62 1260  4    not presume to lecture her on Abstraction. She did
J62 1270  2    not go so far as to say, as was done on other occasions,
J62 1270 15    that Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian
J62 1280  9    invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the
J62 1290  8    people of the U.S.S.R.
J62 1300  1       Pozatti and I could not know then that we would
J62 1300 11    experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow
J62 1310  9    than elsewhere. We were to discover, in fact, that
J62 1320  6    quite a number of people share with us the impression
J62 1330  2    that, in contrast to other Soviet regions, Moscow's
J62 1330 10    atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official. To
J62 1340  7    have one's intentions deliberately or unintentionally
J62 1350  4    misunderstood is always a waste of time. Until our
J62 1360  5    Moscow experience, I had not considered it necessary
J62 1370  1    to prepare any argument formally or informally. Artists
J62 1370  9    simply do not talk to each other in that fashion; and,
J62 1380 10    furthermore, I could not presume the implication that
J62 1390  6    I spoke for American artists as a group. To save time,
J62 1400  5    some clarification seemed necessary. The following
J62 1410  1    is a statement read to a large and friendly group of
J62 1410 12    your fellow artists in Leningrad:
J62 1420  3       "We have come to your land with the express intention
J62 1430  3    of understanding and respecting your ideas and your
J62 1440  1    ways. Our presence here should also be considered further,
J62 1440 10    sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and
J62 1450  8    their chosen government to seek any and all possible
J62 1460  5    ways to effect closer, peaceful ties among all people.
J62 1470  2    We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for
J62 1470 13    the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges
J62 1480  8    of ideas between individuals.
J62 1500  1       In spite of the relatively short period of time
J62 1500 10    that we have experienced among you, we have already
J62 1510  8    seen many indications of your character and spirit.
J62 1520  5    We are acutely aware that yours is a society which,
J62 1530  2    in spite of several wars and many privations, has developed
J62 1540  1    itself into one of the foremost nations of the world.
J62 1540 11    Your past history is resplendent with the fruits of
J62 1550  7    the intellect. Your present history is equally admirable
J62 1560  4    for its industrial and scientific achievements.
J62 1580  1       We have come to you to experience something of your
J62 1580 11    way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with
J62 1600  7    that of ours. While we, as American artists, believe
J62 1610  2    deeply in the universal character of all intellectual
J62 1620  1    activity, we would be less than honest with you, or
J62 1620 11    ourselves, if we failed to state a specific attitude
J62 1630  9    toward our own society as well as the international
J62 1640  5    community as a whole. In stating this position, we
J62 1650  2    should like to make it clear to you that we cannot
J62 1650 13    expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to
J62 1660  7    share our opinion in every respect. As a matter of
J62 1670  5    fact, we prize the diversity among our own people so
J62 1680  2    much that we will not presume to speak for all other
J62 1680 13    American artists. But certainly, all will agree that
J62 1690  7    it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities
J62 1700  5    between you and us, but rather the thoughtful exploration
J62 1710  2    and acceptance of our differences which may lead us
J62 1720  2    to our respective and desired goals with a minimum
J62 1720 11    of misunderstanding.
J62 1730  1       Like yourselves, we have pride and love for our
J62 1730 10    country. To many of us, this is a land to which we
J62 1740 12    or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order
J62 1750  4    to live in dignified freedom. As artists we feel the
J62 1760  3    same obligation, as do other individuals, in considering
J62 1760 11    ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation.
