J70 0010  1       In the midwest, oxidation ponds are used extensively
J70 0010  9    for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban
J70 0020  6    areas. The high cost of land and a few operational
J70 0030  5    problems resulting from excessive loadings have created
J70 0040  2    the need for a wastewater treatment system with the
J70 0040 11    operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but
J70 0050  7    with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit
J70 0060  6    volume.
J70 0060  7       Research at Fayette, Missouri on oxidation ponds
J70 0070  4    has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied
J70 0080  3    from 30 to 53 mg/l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb
J70 0090  3    BOD/day/acre. Since experience indicates that effluents
J70 0100  1    from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at
J70 0100 10    these BOD concentrations, the goal for the effluent
J70 0110  7    quality of the accelerated treatment system was the
J70 0120  5    same as from conventional oxidation ponds. Recent studies
J70 0130  3    by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator
J70 0140  2    could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the
J70 0140 12    rate of oxygen transfer. Their study showed that it
J70 0150  7    was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen/hr/hp.
J70 0160  6       O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated
J70 0170  6    lagoons for treating organic wastes. They indicated
J70 0180  3    that a 4-day retention, aerated lagoon would give 60
J70 0190  1    to 76 per cent BOD reduction. Later, Eckenfelder increased
J70 0200  1    the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per
J70 0200 11    cent in the summer months. It appeared from the limited
J70 0210  7    information available that the aerated lagoon might
J70 0220  4    offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity
J70 0230  1    of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the
J70 0230 10    same degree of treatment in a smaller volume.
J70 0240  7    #RED BRIDGE SUBDIVISION#
J70 0240 10    With the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision
J70 0250  8    south of Kansas City, Missouri, the developer was faced
J70 0260  6    with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal.
J70 0270  3    The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected
J70 0280  2    to serve the Red Bridge area for several years. This
J70 0280 12    necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment
J70 0290  7    facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 yr.
J70 0300  9    For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed
J70 0310  5    as shown in Figure 1. The oxidation pond has a surface
J70 0320  4    area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft. The pond is
J70 0330  2    currently serving 1,230 persons or 260 persons per
J70 0330 10    acre. In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became
J70 0340  7    completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors. It was
J70 0350  5    possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond
J70 0360  2    by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature
J70 0360 11    decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green
J70 0370  9    to green algae.
J70 0380  1       The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation
J70 0380  8    pond necessitated examination of other methods for
J70 0390  7    supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate.
J70 0400  5    At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge
J70 0410  3    Subdivision required the construction of additional
J70 0410  9    sewage treatment facilities. The large land areas required
J70 0420  8    for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially
J70 0430  8    unattractive to the developer. It was proposed that
J70 0440  5    aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at
J70 0450  3    the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary
J70 0460  1    treatment for the additional development.
J70 0460  6    #PILOT LAGOON#
J70 0460  8    The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system
J70 0470  9    prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon
J70 0480  6    pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating
J70 0490  3    domestic sewage. The pilot plant was a circular lagoon
J70 0500  1    81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam
J70 0500 13    at the bottom, 4 ft below the surface, with a volume
J70 0510  9    of 121,000 gal. The side slopes were coated with fiberglas
J70 0520  7    matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion. The
J70 0530  4    pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve
J70 0540  3    the area just south of the existing housing area. The
J70 0540 13    major contributor was a shopping center with houses
J70 0550  8    being added to the system as the subdivision developed.
J70 0560  5    The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes
J70 0570  3    from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period. Initially,
J70 0580  1    the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping
J70 0580  9    center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing
J70 0590  7    over an 18-month period. This operation would permit
J70 0600  4    evaluation of the pilot plant, with a slowly increasing
J70 0610  2    load, over a reasonable period of time.
J70 0610  9       The pilot plant was equipped with a 3-hp turbine
J70 0620  9    aerator (Figure 2). The aerator had a variable-speed
J70 0630  6    drive to permit operation through a range of speeds.
J70 0640  3    The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered
J70 0640 12    and continuously recorded on 24-hr charts. The raw
J70 0650  9    sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator
J70 0660  6    to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the
J70 0670  5    aeration tank contents. The effluent was collected
J70 0680  1    through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River
J70 0680 10    through a surface drainage ditch.
J70 0690  3    #ANALYSES#
J70 0690  4    Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals.
J70 0700  3    The long retention period and the complete mixing concept
J70 0710  2    prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor
J70 0710 10    or in the effluent. Weekly samples would make any changes
J70 0720  7    more readily discernible than daily samples. The composite
J70 0730  6    samples were normally collected over a 6-hr period,
J70 0740  6    but an occasional 24-hr composite was made. Examination
J70 0750  2    of the operations of the shopping center permitted
J70 0750 10    correlation of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr
J70 0760 10    operations. The data indicated that the organic load
J70 0770  7    during the 6-hr composites was essentially 50 per
J70 0780  4    cent of the 24-hr organic load.
J70 0780 11       Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation
J70 0790  7    pond to determine its operating conditions. Efforts
J70 0800  4    were made to take the grab samples at random periods
J70 0810  3    so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr
J70 0820  1    composite sample. A single 24-hr composite sample
J70 0820  9    indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics
J70 0830  6    were typical.
J70 0830  8    #PILOT PLANT OPERATIONS#
J70 0840  2    The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied
J70 0850  1    between 110 and 710 mg/l with an average of 350 mg/l.
J70 0860  1    This was equivalent to 240 mg/lBOD on a 24-hr basis.
J70 0860 12    The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic
J70 0870 10    sewage from a subdivision. The BOD in the effluent
J70 0880  6    averaged 58 mg/l, a 76-per cent reduction over the
J70 0890  5    24-hr period. Examination of the data in Table I
J70 0900  4    shows that a few samples contributed to raising the
J70 0900 13    effluent BOD. The periods of high effluent BOD occurred
J70 0910  9    during cold periods when operational problems with
J70 0920  7    the aerator resulted. Ice caused the aerator to overload,
J70 0930  7    straining the drive belts. The slippage of the drive
J70 0940  5    belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen
J70 0950  2    transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.
J70 0950 12       The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb
J70 0960  9    of BOD/day or about 2 lb BOD/dayI000 cu ft aeration
J70 0970  7    capacity. Needless to say, the organic load was very
J70 0980  8    low on a volumetric basis, but was 270 lb BOD/day/acre
J70 0990  4    on a surface loading basis. It seems that the aerated
J70 1000  3    lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or
J70 1000 12    a lightly loaded activated sludge system.
J70 1010  5       The flow rate remained relatively constant during
J70 1020  3    the winter months as shown in Table I. With the spring
J70 1030  3    rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in
J70 1030 12    open sewers. As construction progresses, the volume
J70 1040  7    of storm drainage will be sharply reduced. The retention
J70 1050  6    period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6
J70 1060  5    days, averaging 6.4 days.
J70 1060  9       The large amount of vegetable grindings from the
J70 1070  6    grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended
J70 1080  4    solids problem. The vegetables were not readily metabolized
J70 1090  1    by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to
J70 1090 11    float on the surface. A skimming device at the effluent
J70 1100  9    weir prevented loss of most of these light solids.
J70 1110  6    The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent
J70 1120  3    was 75 mg/l while MLSS averaged 170 mg/l volatile
J70 1130  2    suspended solids. The average sludge age based on displacement
J70 1140  1    of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days. The oxygen
J70 1140 11    uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 mg/l/hr
J70 1150  8    during the first four months of this study. Variations
J70 1160  7    in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this
J70 1170  5    study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen
J70 1180  1    demand. The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2
J70 1180 10    to 2.6 mg/l/hr which followed an increase in rotor
J70 1190  7    speed was believed to be related to resuspension of
J70 1200  6    solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds.
J70 1210  3    It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended
J70 1210 12    solids were active microbial solids with the heavier,
J70 1220  8    less active solids settling out.
J70 1230  3       The suspended solids discharged in the effluent
J70 1240  1    were found to be the major source of the BOD. Removal
J70 1240 12    of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded
J70 1250  7    an average effluent containing only 20 mg/l BOD.
J70 1260  5    The BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot
J70 1270  4    plant effluent averaged 12 mg/l. This low BOD was
J70 1280  2    due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation
J70 1290  1    since the only dilution was surface runoff which was
J70 1290 10    very low during this study.
J70 1300  3    #MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION#
J70 1300  5    Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed
J70 1310  6    liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various
J70 1320  5    types of protozoa. It was found that the aerated lagoon
J70 1330  3    was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation
J70 1340  1    pond. At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor.
J70 1340 12    The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc.
J70 1350  6    The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc
J70 1360  5    settled out.
J70 1360  7       Initially, the flagellated protozoa predominated,
J70 1370  3    but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated
J70 1380  1    protozoa. As the temperature decreased, the number
J70 1380  8    of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased. Very
J70 1390  5    little protozoa activity existed below 40`F. When
J70 1400  4    the temperature reached 32`F all protozoan activity
J70 1410  2    ceased; but as the temperature rose, the numbers of
J70 1420  1    protozoa increased rapidly. Only once were stalked
J70 1420  8    ciliates found in the mixed liquor. The predomination
J70 1430  6    of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of
J70 1440  4    a high bacterial population.
J70 1440  8    #OXYGEN TRANSFER#
J70 1440 10    One of the important aspects of this study was to determine
J70 1450 11    the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical
J70 1460  6    aerator. Routine determinations were made for dissolved
J70 1470  5    oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates.
J70 1480  3    The data given in Table II show the routine operation
J70 1490  1    of the aerator. The dissolved oxygen in the aeration
J70 1490 10    unit was consistently high until January 29, 1961.
J70 1500  6    An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the
J70 1510  7    aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and
J70 1520  2    caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water.
J70 1520 12    The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive
J70 1530  8    belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity. It
J70 1540  4    was approximately one month before the belt problem
J70 1550  2    was noticed and corrected, but at no time was there
J70 1550 12    a deficiency of dissolved oxygen.
J70 1560  4       A series of eight special tests were conducted at
J70 1570  3    different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer
J70 1580  1    rate. Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene
J70 1580 11    cover to simulate an ice cover. The rate of oxygen
J70 1590  9    transfer at 1.0-mg/l dissolved oxygen concentration
J70 1600  4    and 10`C for various rotor speeds is given in Table
J70 1610  5    III. The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg/l
J70 1620  2    dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb/day at a
J70 1620 11    maximum rate of 9.3 mg/l/hr. The actual power requirements
J70 1630  9    indicated 2lb oxygen transfer/hr/hp. The polyethylene
J70 1640  6    cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent,
J70 1650  9    indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the
J70 1660  6    rotor rather than through the surface.
J70 1660 12    #OXIDATION POND#
J70 1670  2    During this study septic conditions developed in the
J70 1680  1    oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted. Shortly
J70 1680 11    after this study ended septic conditions resulted which
J70 1690  7    required the addition of sodium nitrate. The location
J70 1700  5    of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area
J70 1710  3    makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer.
J70 1720  1    The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage
J70 1720  9    ranged from 160 to 270 mg/l of BOD with an average
J70 1730 10    of 230 mg/l. The BOD data are given in Table IV.
J70 1740  9    A single 24-hr composite sample had a BOD of 260
J70 1750  7    mg/l, indicating a typical domestic sewage. The daily
J70 1760  5    sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147,000
J70 1770  2    gpd, giving a retention period of 42 days. The organic
J70 1780  1    loading on the pond was slightly under 60lbBOD/day/acre.
J70 1790  1       The effluent BOD averaged 34 mg/l, a little lower
J70 1800  1    than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading
J70 1800 12    of 60lb BOD/day/acre. The BOD of the effluent ranged
J70 1810  8    from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47mg/l. Microscopic
J70 1820 10    examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD
J70 1830  7    occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold
J70 1840  5    weather. When the algae began to build up again, the
J70 1850  3    effluent BOD rose. During the two weeks when the algae
J70 1860  1    disappeared from the effluent BOD's in the effluent
J70 1860  9    were 18 and 16 mg/l.
