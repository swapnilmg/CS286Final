E03 0010  1       FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous
E03 0010  9    energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can
E03 0020  8    be felt much better than it can be heard. The pulsating
E03 0030  7    vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach.
E03 0040  5       Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused
E03 0050  2    so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are
E03 0050 10    fearsome, but the long-range ballistic missile gives
E03 0060  8    them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much
E03 0070  5    more terrifying.
E03 0070  7       A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently
E03 0080  6    overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he
E03 0090  5    were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear
E03 0100  1    rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further
E03 0100 11    and reason that an attacker, in possession of such
E03 0110  7    absolute power, would simultaneously destroy his opponent's
E03 0120  4    cities and people. With a nation defenseless before
E03 0130  2    it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people?
E03 0140  1    Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people
E03 0140  9    be the logical act of complete subjugation? The nation
E03 0150  7    would be utterly devastated. The will of its people,
E03 0160  6    so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.
E03 0170  1       Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for
E03 0170 10    self-destruction in hours or days; and now rockets
E03 0180  8    have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes.
E03 0190  6    At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities,
E03 0200  3    being "soft", and the people within them are ideally
E03 0210  1    suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.
E03 0210  7       However, because this vulnerability is mutual, it
E03 0220  6    is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the
E03 0230  4    opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent
E03 0240  1    has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.
E03 0240  9    It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading
E03 0250  5    is not a profitable military tactic.
E03 0260  1       ICBMs have given us a capability which could be
E03 0260 10    used in two different ways. They could be used to attack
E03 0270 10    a nation's people (which would inevitably mean the
E03 0280  6    loss of the attacker's own people), or they could be
E03 0290  5    used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military
E03 0300  1    force.
E03 0300  2       If our national interest lies in being able to fight
E03 0310  2    and win a war rather than committing national suicide,
E03 0310 11    then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic
E03 0320  9    missiles. We must determine whether missiles can win
E03 0330  6    a war all by themselves. We must make certain that
E03 0340  3    the aircraft is finished before we give the entire
E03 0340 12    job to the missile.
E03 0350  4       Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they also
E03 0360  2    have their too little known limitations.
E03 0360  8       Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory, the
E03 0370  4    location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately.
E03 0380  4    Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads,
E03 0390  1    highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them
E03 0390 10    with passive protection by taking advantage of the
E03 0400  8    gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today-
E03 0410  4    the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving
E03 0420  5    target with such weapons. One must first detect a fleeting
E03 0430  3    mobile or moving target, decide that it is worthy of
E03 0440  1    destruction, select the missile to be fired against
E03 0440  9    the target, compute ballistics for the flight, and
E03 0450  7    prepare the missile for firing.
E03 0460  2       Even if all these operations could be performed
E03 0460 10    instantaneously, the ICBM still has a time of flight
E03 0470  9    to the target of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the
E03 0480  8    target can significantly change its location in something
E03 0490  5    less than 30 minutes, the probability of having destroyed
E03 0500  3    it is drastically lowered.
E03 0500  7       Because of this, it would appear inevitable that
E03 0510  6    an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will
E03 0520  3    seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile
E03 0530  1    defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high
E03 0530  9    kill probability.
E03 0540  1       In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving,
E03 0540  9    or imprecisely located strategic forces, we must have
E03 0550  7    a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles.
E03 0560  6    Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed
E03 0570  4    by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only
E03 0580  1    means available to us.
E03 0580  5       It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war
E03 0590  3    is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's
E03 0600  1    citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic
E03 0600 10    force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into
E03 0610  6    China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic
E03 0620  4    forces which continued to threaten us.
E03 0630  1       Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile
E03 0630 12    ICBM force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft
E03 0640  9    such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations
E03 0650  8    against Soviet railway-based missiles. If we stop thinking
E03 0660  6    in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons
E03 0670  3    and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons
E03 0670 10    which may be more appropriate for most important military
E03 0680  9    targets, it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could
E03 0690 10    carry a great many small nuclear weapons.
E03 0700  3       An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons
E03 0710  1    could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress
E03 0710 10    all trains operating within a specified geographic
E03 0720  6    area of Russia- provided that we had used some of our
E03 0730  7    ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our
E03 0740  3    bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy
E03 0750  1    other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets
E03 0750  8    as well as the known, fixed and hardened targets which
E03 0760  8    can also be destroyed by missile.
E03 0770  2       Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important
E03 0780  1    role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other
E03 0780 10    way to do the job?
E03 0790  3       Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris,
E03 0800  1    mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan,
E03 0800  9    and airborne Skybolt) means that it will take some
E03 0810  8    time, perhaps weeks, to destroy a strategic force.
E03 0820  4    War, under these circumstances, cannot be one massive
E03 0830  2    exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces will survive
E03 0830  9    a surprise attack, and these forces will give depth,
E03 0840  8    or considerable duration, to the conflict.
E03 0850  4    ##
E03 0850  5    THE forces which survive the initial attack must be
E03 0860  3    found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found
E03 0860 12    and destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of
E03 0870 11    finding and destroying mobile forces? They are not
E03 0880  6    susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile.
E03 0890  4       Some day, many years in the future, true spacecraft
E03 0900  2    will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But
E03 0900 12    until we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to
E03 0910  9    the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft.
E03 0920  5       However, the aircraft which we have today are tied
E03 0930  4    to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can destroy
E03 0940  2    airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft
E03 0940 11    are vital to winning a war today because they can perform
E03 0950 11    those missions which a missile is totally incapable
E03 0960  7    of performing; but the airfield, on which the aircraft
E03 0970  5    is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile.
E03 0980  1    This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission,
E03 0980 11    weapon. Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use
E03 0990  9    them only once.
E03 1000  1       This is the point on which so many people have written
E03 1000 12    off the aircraft in favor of the missile. But remember
E03 1010  8    this- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to
E03 1020  5    nuclear rockets, it is the airfield. Eliminate the
E03 1030  3    vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have
E03 1040  2    essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range
E03 1040  9    ballistic missiles.
E03 1050  2       There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or
E03 1060  1    eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:
E03 1060  9       @ Put aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they
E03 1070  8    are on the ground.
E03 1080  1       @ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from
E03 1080 11    small (3,000-foot) airfields with runways. If we could
E03 1090  7    use all the small airfields we have in this country,
E03 1100  6    we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor
E03 1110  4    of 10 or more.
E03 1110  8       @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range
E03 1120  4    military aircraft in the air for the majority of their
E03 1130  1    useful life.
E03 1130  3       @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines,
E03 1140  1    develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) long-range
E03 1150  1    military aircraft.
E03 1150  3       We have the technology today with which to build
E03 1160  2    aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200
E03 1160 10    psi. We could put a portion of our strategic bombers
E03 1170  9    in such shelters.
E03 1171  1       Large, long-range bombers can be developed which
E03 1180  8    would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot
E03 1190  7    runways, but they would require more powerful engines
E03 1200  2    than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for
E03 1200 11    spending money to develop more powerful engines because
E03 1210  8    of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been
E03 1220  6    made obsolete by the missile.
E03 1220 11       This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense
E03 1230  8    of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort
E03 1240  6    to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft. One seldom
E03 1250  3    hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for the
E03 1260  2    aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".
E03 1270  1       If, for some reason such as economy, we are not
E03 1270 10    going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a
E03 1280  5    sense of national urgency, then we should turn our
E03 1290  3    effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight
E03 1290 13    ratio of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as
E03 1300 11    these, vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft
E03 1310  5    could be built. For example, a 12-to-one engine would
E03 1320  3    power a supersonic VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one
E03 1330  1    engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds
E03 1330  8    could rise vertically. The reason that we are not going
E03 1340  9    ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines
E03 1350  7    is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars- and
E03 1360  4    you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are
E03 1370  2    obsolete.
E03 1370  3       When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields,
E03 1380  1    they are no longer vulnerable to ICBMs. If our SAC
E03 1390  1    bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise
E03 1390  9    missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or
E03 1400  6    long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia
E03 1410  5    again, and again, and again, those bombers would unquestionably
E03 1420  2    assure our military dominance.
E03 1420  6       We would have the means to seek out and destroy
E03 1430  8    the enemy's force- whether it were fixed or mobile.
E03 1440  5    With such a force of manned bombers we could bring
E03 1450  1    enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure
E03 1450 11    would be selective and extremely discriminating. No
E03 1460  6    need to kill an entire city and all its people because
E03 1470  6    we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively
E03 1480  3    disarm the enemy's military force.
E03 1480  8       Our first necessity, at the very outset of war,
E03 1490  8    is post-attack reconnaissance. In a few years we will
E03 1500  7    have SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation system).
E03 1510  2    But in the case of moving targets, and targets which
E03 1520  1    have limited mobility, what will their location be
E03 1520  9    when it is time to destroy them? What targets have
E03 1530  6    we successfully knocked out? A ballistic missile cannot,
E03 1540  4    today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.
E03 1550  1    What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial
E03 1550 10    questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.
E03 1560  8    SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds- and
E03 1570  9    to see in the dark.
E03 1580  1       Even if this is some day possible, there remains
E03 1580  9    the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas
E03 1590  9    target. If the target can change its position significantly
E03 1600  4    during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on
E03 1610  4    its way, the probability of the missile destroying
E03 1610 12    the target is drastically reduced.
E03 1620  4       Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack
E03 1630  5    reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably.
E03 1640  4    It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather
E03 1650  1    that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under
E03 1650  9    the clouds and perform infrared photography through
E03 1660  6    clouds and at night.
E03 1670  1       It would be even more valuable because that same
E03 1670  9    aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered-
E03 1680  6    no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from
E03 1690  7    the United States with the chance that the target,
E03 1700  3    if it were mobile, would be gone.
E03 1700 10       A large aircraft, such as the B-52 or B-70, could
E03 1710 10    carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons. Few
E03 1720  4    people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive
E03 1730  1    power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet.
E03 1730 10    Or put another way, the hardest missile site planned
E03 1740  8    today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead
E03 1750  7    (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
E03 1760  3    within 100 to 200 feet of the target!
E03 1770  1       It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces
E03 1770 10    the use of very large yield nuclear weapons.
E03 1780  4       Today we have side-looking radar which has such
E03 1790  3    high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows
E03 1790 11    individual buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate
E03 1800  6    spans of bridges, etc. With these keen "eyes" and
E03 1810  6    small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, military
E03 1820  2    forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage
E03 1830  1    to urban areas.
E03 1830  4       If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and
E03 1840  2    destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care
E03 1840 10    and precision, and if war comes in spite of our most
E03 1850 10    ardent desires for peace, our choice of alternatives
E03 1860  5    will be truly frightening.
