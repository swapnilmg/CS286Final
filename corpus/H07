H07 0010  1    _SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN RHODE ISLAND._
H07 0010  6       It is not within the scope of this report elaborate
H07 0020  4    in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode
H07 0030  2    Island. However, a word should be mentioned in regard
H07 0030 11    to them as independent units of government.
H07 0040  6       There are forty-seven special district governments
H07 0050  3    in Rhode Island (excluding two regional school districts,
H07 0060  2    four housing authorities, and the Kent County Water
H07 0070  1    Authority). These forty-seven special purpose governments
H07 0070  8    have the authority to levy taxes, to borrow money,
H07 0080  8    own property, sue and be sued, and in general to exercise
H07 0090  6    normal corporate powers. Unlike cities and towns, however,
H07 0100  4    they do not have to submit any financial statements
H07 0110  1    to the state Bureau of Audits. It is not an exaggeration
H07 0110 12    to say that the state government has little or no fiscal
H07 0120 10    control over these units of government. In addition
H07 0130  5    to the collection of service charges, the special districts
H07 0140  4    levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000.
H07 0150  1    #FISCAL YEARS IN OTHER STATES#
H07 0150  6    _COMPARATIVE DATA._
H07 0150  8       A review of practices in other states regarding
H07 0160  8    fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report. Included
H07 0170  5    in the findings are:
H07 0170  9    _1._
H07 0170 10       Forty-six states, including Rhode Island, end their
H07 0180  7    fiscal year on June 30. The other four states end on
H07 0190  8    varying dates: Alabama (Sept. 30), New York (March
H07 0200  5    31), Pennsylvania (May 31), and Texas (August 31).
H07 0210  2    _2._
H07 0210  3       In sixteen states, the fiscal year ending of the
H07 0220  1    cities (June 30) is the same as that of the state:
H07 0220 12    Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Massachusetts,
H07 0230  4    Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North
H07 0240  4    Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming,
H07 0250  4    and Hawaii).
H07 0250  6    _3._
H07 0250  7       In eleven states, the fiscal year of the cities
H07 0260  7    ends on December 31, while the state fiscal year ends
H07 0270  3    on June 30 (Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, New
H07 0280  1    Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Washington,
H07 0290  1    and Wisconsin).
H07 0290  3    _4._
H07 0290  4       In eight states whose fiscal years close on June
H07 0300  3    30, a majority of their cities close their fiscal year
H07 0300 13    on December 31: (Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
H07 0310  7    Minnesota, Virginia, and South Carolina).
H07 0320  5    _5._
H07 0320  6       One state, Alabama, closes its fiscal year on September
H07 0330  6    30, and all cities in the state, with one exception,
H07 0340  3    also close fiscal years on September 30.
H07 0340 10    _6._
H07 0350  1       Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30, while
H07 0350 10    all of its cities close their fiscal years on September
H07 0360  7    30.
H07 0360  8    _7._
H07 0360  9       Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31. All
H07 0370  8    of its cities close their fiscal years on December
H07 0380  4    31.
H07 0380  5       The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal
H07 0390  2    years for the state, city and local governments. However,
H07 0400  1    only Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Rhode Island have
H07 0400  9    a situation in which the sundry units of government
H07 0410  8    vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity.
H07 0420  2    #FISCAL UNIFORMITY: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES#
H07 0430  1    _ADVANTAGES._
H07 0430  2       An excellent summary of advantages concerning the
H07 0440  2    uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars
H07 0440  9    was contained in a paper presented by a public finance
H07 0450  9    authority recently. He listed among the values of fiscal
H07 0460  6    uniformity:
H07 0460  7    _1._
H07 0460  8       The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with
H07 0470  5    common sense administration of local finances: adoption
H07 0480  3    of the budget, or financial plan, in advance of spending.
H07 0490  1    _2._
H07 0490  2       The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with
H07 0490  9    another common sense rule, that of having cash in the
H07 0500 10    bank before checks are drawn. It enables towns to make
H07 0510  8    more economical purchases and to take advantage of
H07 0520  4    cash discounts.
H07 0520  6    _3._
H07 0520  7       The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting
H07 0530  4    and strengthens control over expenditures. By fixing
H07 0540  3    the tax rate in advance of spending, upper limits are
H07 0540 13    set on expenditures.
H07 0550  3    _4._
H07 0550  4       The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal
H07 0560  2    year into line with that of the schools, which expend
H07 0560 12    the largest share of local disbursements. This greatly
H07 0570  7    simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting.
H07 0580  5    _5._
H07 0580  6       The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges
H07 0590  5    on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes.
H07 0600  3    Furthermore, tax collections not immediately needed
H07 0610  1    for current expenditures may be invested in short-term
H07 0610 10    treasury notes, augmenting the town's miscellaneous
H07 0620  5    revenues and reducing the tax levy.
H07 0630  2    _6._
H07 0630  3       The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison
H07 0640  1    of revenues and expenditures. When towns have the same
H07 0640 10    fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful
H07 0650  9    comparisons; and as the cost of local government increases,
H07 0660  6    the demand for such comparison also increases. Towns
H07 0670  3    having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.
H07 0680  1       Of all advantages, probably none is more important
H07 0680  9    than the elimination of tax anticipation notes. Borrowing
H07 0690  8    in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues
H07 0700  7    is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities
H07 0710  3    at all times. It may be by bank loans, sale of notes
H07 0720  3    or warrants, or by the somewhat casual method of issuance
H07 0720 13    and registration of warrants. In any event it is a
H07 0730 10    form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered
H07 0740  7    unnecessary. Its elimination would result in the saving
H07 0750  5    of interest costs, heavy when short-term money rates
H07 0760  1    are high, and in freedom from dependence on credit
H07 0760 10    which is not always available when needed most. This
H07 0770  6    type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly
H07 0780  6    installment payment of taxes is instituted and the
H07 0790  3    first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal
H07 0790 12    year. Any approach toward such a system looks toward
H07 0800  7    saving and security.
H07 0810  1       It should be noted that there are other and equally
H07 0810 11    important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental
H07 0820  5    reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year. Both the
H07 0830  5    federal and state governments commence their fiscal
H07 0840  2    years on July 1. Both units of government contribute
H07 0840 11    increasingly large sums of money to the several local
H07 0850  9    governments in this state as indicated below: @
H07 0860  6       It has been said that when local government revenues
H07 0870  3    were mostly produced locally from the property tax,
H07 0880  2    the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap;
H07 0880 13    but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid,
H07 0890  9    the emphasis on equalization, and the state-local sharing
H07 0900  6    of responsibility for certain important functions,
H07 0910  2    this is no longer true. The haphazard fiscal year calendar
H07 0920  1    is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient
H07 0920 11    state-local revenue and expenditure relationships.
H07 0930  5    _DISADVANTAGES._
H07 0930  6       Although there are many sound reasons for adopting
H07 0940  8    uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island,
H07 0950  5    there are also certain difficulties encountered. These
H07 0960  2    involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to
H07 0960 10    fiscal uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages
H07 0970  8    to the principle. One problem is a matter of shifting
H07 0980  8    dates; the other, is how to finance the transition.
H07 0990  4       Little can be done about the changing of dates.
H07 1000  3    This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars.
H07 1000 12    It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying
H07 1010  9    public for a period of time. But cooperation and understanding
H07 1020  7    between local officials and the citizenry help lessen
H07 1030  6    this problem.
H07 1030  8       The other problem is the matter of financing the
H07 1040  7    transition period in the several cities and towns.
H07 1050  3    This will be covered more fully later. It should be
H07 1050 13    kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which
H07 1060 10    a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is
H07 1070  7    directly dependent upon the financial condition of
H07 1080  3    that town or city. Fortunately, there are no cities
H07 1080 12    or towns in the state, with one or two possible exceptions
H07 1090 10    that are in too difficult a position to finance the
H07 1100  7    proposed change. Sacrifice will have to be made in
H07 1110  6    some cases, but it is to the municipality's advantage
H07 1120  1    to finance the change-over for a short period of time
H07 1120 12    rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes
H07 1130  7    indefinitely.
H07 1130  8    #ADJUSTING THE FISCAL CALENDARS#
H07 1140  3    The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized
H07 1150  2    fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently
H07 1150  9    great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort
H07 1160  8    to secure them. The type of program desired can be
H07 1170  7    determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments
H07 1180  4    needed. Two features are immediately evident. First,
H07 1190  1    the present situation is too varied to be systematized
H07 1190 10    by any single formula. Second, the shift to a uniform
H07 1200  8    July 1-June 30 fiscal year will, of itself, improve
H07 1210  5    the tax collection calendars of the great majority
H07 1220  2    of cities and towns. There are at least two problems
H07 1220 12    to consider: one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal
H07 1230  9    calendar; the other is how to finance the adjustments
H07 1240  7    when necessary. The latter matter is considered in
H07 1250  4    detail in a later section.
H07 1250  9       Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently
H07 1260  6    indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated
H07 1270  4    fiscal-tax year calendar. Plans vary from the "talking
H07 1280  3    stage" to establishing special committees to accomplish
H07 1290  1    this end. What is important here is that many of the
H07 1290 12    cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal
H07 1300  7    practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them.
H07 1310  5       An analysis of the fiscal-tax collection year calendars
H07 1320  3    throughout the state indicates that transition may
H07 1330  2    not be as painful as is commonly thought. However,
H07 1330 11    it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial
H07 1340  7    condition of the individual cities and towns involved.
H07 1350  5       The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and
H07 1360  4    coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout
H07 1370  1    Rhode Island, based on a July 1-June 30 year, are shown
H07 1370 13    below.
H07 1380  1    _NO ADJUSTMENT NEEDED._
H07 1380  4       Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1-June
H07 1390  4    30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection
H07 1400  1    year with it. No change is required for these towns.
H07 1400 11    These municipalities include: Barrington, Lincoln,
H07 1410  4    Middletown, Newport, North Kingstown, and South Kingstown.
H07 1420  5    _ADJUSTMENT OF FISCAL YEAR._
H07 1430  1       One town and one city, Coventry and East Providence,
H07 1430 10    require an adjustment of their fiscal year only. This
H07 1440  7    change will automatically adjust their tax collection
H07 1450  4    year calendar so as to make all tax installments due
H07 1460  2    and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that
H07 1460 11    year.
H07 1470  1    _ADJUSTMENT OF TAX COLLECTION YEAR._
H07 1470  6       Six cities and towns are now on a July 1-June 30
H07 1480  7    fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax
H07 1490  2    collection year calendar to establish uniformity. These
H07 1490  9    cities and towns include Bristol, Glocester, Pawtucket,
H07 1500  6    Cumberland, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.
H07 1510  4    _SIMULTANEOUS ADJUSTMENTS._
H07 1510  6       Two cities to be considered, Providence and Cranston,
H07 1520  7    are an enigma. Both have excellent integration of their
H07 1530  5    fiscal-tax collection year calendars. However, neither
H07 1540  3    of these two cities is on the desired July 1-June 30
H07 1550  2    fiscal year.
H07 1550  4       The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal
H07 1560  1    period could be accomplished relatively easy for them.
H07 1560  9    In that both cities end their fiscal years on September
H07 1570  9    30, they could levy taxes for an interim period of
H07 1580  6    nine months, commencing with September 30 and ending
H07 1590  4    with June 30. These three installment dates would be:
H07 1600  1    October 26, January 26, and April 25 (Providence) and
H07 1600 10    November 15, February 16 and May 15 (Cranston). Both
H07 1610  9    would start their new fiscal year on July 1. Their
H07 1620  7    tax collection calendar could then be: July 25, October
H07 1630  4    26, January 26, and April 25, (Providence); and August
H07 1640  3    15, November 15, February 17, and May 15, (Cranston).
H07 1650  1    Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would
H07 1650  9    be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using
H07 1660  8    the same installment periods.
H07 1670  1    _VARYING ADJUSTMENTS._
H07 1670  3       The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years
H07 1680  2    which end prior to June 30. All of these towns will
H07 1680 13    require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection
H07 1690  9    years. Assuming an adjustment to the July 1-June 30
H07 1700  9    fiscal year, the required adjustment of the tax collection
H07 1710  5    years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3.
H07 1720  2    #METHODS OF FINANCING ADJUSTMENTS#
H07 1720  6    Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax
H07 1730  7    calendars, there is the problem of financing the adjustment
H07 1740  3    when this is necessary. It should be emphasized strongly
H07 1750  2    that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim
H07 1750 11    budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and
H07 1760  8    above normal governmental requirements. In many communities
H07 1770  5    there is simply no financial problem; it is only a
H07 1780  6    matter of adjusting accounting methods, careful fiscal
H07 1790  2    planning and management, or some like combination of
H07 1790 10    techniques. In other municipalities the difficulties
H07 1800  6    in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently
H07 1810  5    great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes.
H07 1820  4    Fortunately, such cases in Rhode Island are more the
H07 1830  2    exception than the rule.
H07 1830  6       As shown earlier in Table 1, the several cities
H07 1840  4    and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection
H07 1850  1    calendars. In addition, no two Rhode Island communities
H07 1850  9    are identical in relation to their over-all financial
H07 1860  8    condition. These factors practically insure that no
H07 1870  5    single financing formula is feasible; each situation
H07 1880  2    must be studied and a plan developed that takes into
H07 1880 12    consideration such factors as the effect of the existing
H07 1890  9    and prospective tax calendars, the financial condition
H07 1900  6    of the treasuries, and the length of the transition
H07 1910  4    interval. Suitable plans range from those that are
H07 1920  1    very easy to develop to those that are difficult to
H07 1920 11    formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term
H07 1930  6    serial notes to long-term bonds.
H07 1940  1       The financial problem, where it exists, usually
H07 1940  8    stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional
H07 1950  9    or adjustment period. For those communities which have
H07 1960  5    financial difficulties in effecting adjustments, there
H07 1970  2    are a number of alternatives any one of which alone,
H07 1980  1    or in combination with others, would minimize if not
H07 1980 10    even eliminate the problem.
