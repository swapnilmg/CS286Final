B27 0010  1    #CONFRONTATION#
B27 0010  2    IT SEEMS TO ME that N.C., in his editorial "Confrontation"
B27 0020  2    [SR, Mar. 25], has hit upon the real problem that
B27 0030  3    bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain
B27 0040  1    our personal relationship with those who suffer? This
B27 0040  9    affects us all intimately, and can leave us hopeless
B27 0050  8    in the face of widespread distress. I know of no other
B27 0060  6    solution than the one N.C. proposes- to do what we
B27 0070  7    can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that
B27 0080  1    this will spread beyond him to others at some time
B27 0080 11    and some place. Never have I seen this expressed so
B27 0090  7    clearly and so sympathetically. @
B27 0100  1       THANK YOU for the illustrated editorial "Confrontation".
B27 0110  1    It is both great writing and profound religion. @
B27 0120  1       N.C. HAS SAID something important so well that this
B27 0120  9    preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole
B27 0130 10    piece. @
B27 0130 12       I FEEL THAT N.C. hit the very core of our existence
B27 0140 11    in the editorial "Confrontation". Personally, it meant
B27 0150  5    a great deal; my only hope is that it will be shared
B27 0160  9    by many, many others. @
B27 0170  1       "CONFRONTATION" should fortify us all, whether in
B27 0170  7    Southeast Asia or the U.S. @
B27 0180  6       CONGRATULATIONS TO N.C. for successfully delving
B27 0190  4    into the heart of the problems that face the Peace
B27 0200  2    Corps. I concur that it is necessary for Americans
B27 0200 11    to have a confrontation of the situation existing in
B27 0210  8    foreign lands. It would be heartbreaking to see idealism,
B27 0220  6    and hence effective leadership, thwarted by the poverty
B27 0230  4    and hardship which young Americans will run into. @
B27 0240  2       THE EDITORIAL "Confrontation" was certainly direct
B27 0250  1    in its appear to those of us living here in America.
B27 0250 12    I personally gained strength from it. Thanks for continuing
B27 0260  8    to capture the attention and uncover so many areas
B27 0270  6    of need in this amazing world. @
B27 0280  1       N.C.'s EDITORIAL "Confrontation" is a stunning piece
B27 0290  1    of writing. I would hope that Sargent Shriver will
B27 0290 10    encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read
B27 0300  7    it. The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs
B27 0310  6    and the Castros ... but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys,
B27 0320  4    and the others like them whose names we will never
B27 0330  2    know. @
B27 0330  4       EDITOR'S NOTE: Reprints of "Confrontation" will
B27 0340  2    be included among the material to be distributed to
B27 0350  1    members of the Peace Corps. A Peace Corps official
B27 0350 10    described the editorial as "precisely the message we
B27 0360  7    need to communicate to the men and women who will soon
B27 0370  7    be Peace Corps volunteers".
B27 0370 11    #IMPROPER BOSTONIAN?#
B27 0380  2    F. L. LUCAS'S article in SR's April 1 issue seemed
B27 0390  5    to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New
B27 0400  2    English Bible. I certainly hope this will be the impression
B27 0400 12    left in the minds of readers, rather than the comment
B27 0410 10    by Cleveland Amory in his FIRST OF THE MONTH column.
B27 0420  8    It is blind, fundamentalist dogmatism to say, "Messing
B27 0430  5    around with the King James version ... seems to us
B27 0440  5    a perilous sport at best". @
B27 0440 11    #FACTS IN FOCUS#
B27 0450  1    LESTER MARKEL is on the right track in his article
B27 0450 11    "Interpretation of Interpretation" [SR, Mar. 11].
B27 0460  4    The current stereotype of straight news reporting was
B27 0470  6    probably invaluable in protecting the press and its
B27 0480  5    readers from pollution by that combination of doctored
B27 0490  1    fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism
B27 0490  9    which flourished in this country more than a generation
B27 0500  8    ago.
B27 0500  9       We don't need this type of protection any more.
B27 0510  8    The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous
B27 0520  4    competing media. Besides, there are no longer enough
B27 0530  3    corruptible journalists about.
B27 0530  6       The accepted method of writing news has two major
B27 0540  7    liabilities. First, it does not communicate. A reporter
B27 0550  3    restricted to the competing propaganda statements of
B27 0560  2    both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance,
B27 0560 11    is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows
B27 0570  8    about the causes of the dispute. Second, it subjects
B27 0580  4    the news to distortion by the unscrupulous. The charges
B27 0590  2    by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only
B27 0590 11    destroyed innocent people but misled the nation. Yet
B27 0600  8    the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective
B27 0610  7    in its news columns. despite several years of front-page
B27 0620  5    stories, the average citizen was unable to get a complete
B27 0630  3    picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television
B27 0630 12    screen what the reporters had been seeing all along
B27 0640  9    but had no effective way of communicating. The Senator
B27 0650  5    had boxed them in with their own restrictions.
B27 0660  1       It seems to me the time has come for the American
B27 0670  1    press to start experimenting with ways of reporting
B27 0670  9    the news that will do a better job of communicating
B27 0680  7    and will be less subject to abuse by those who have
B27 0690  4    learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to
B27 0690 12    serve their own ends. The objective should be to provide
B27 0700 10    a method of getting into print a higher percentage
B27 0710  6    than is now possible of the relevant information in
B27 0720  3    the possession of reporters and editors. @
B27 0730  1    #SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT#
B27 0730  4    I WOULD LIKE to see you devote some space in an early
B27 0740  6    issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's
B27 0750  2    activities, so far as Southern California is concerned.
B27 0760  1    You have on more than one occasion praised the idea
B27 0760 11    of a televised press conference and the chance it gives
B27 0770  8    the people to form intelligent opinions.
B27 0780  2       To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles Times
B27 0790  1    does not publish a transcript of these press conferences.
B27 0790 10    I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.
B27 0800 10       Next, because of the time differential, the conferences
B27 0810  8    come on the networks during the middle of the day.
B27 0820  7    Up until now, the networks have grudgingly run half-hour
B27 0830  4    tapes at 5 P.M. or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P.M. Even
B27 0840  2    then, a few of the "less interesting" questions are
B27 0850  1    edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator.
B27 0850  9    However, last night the tapes were not run at all during
B27 0860  9    the evening hours and all we got on TV were a few
B27 0870  6    snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley
B27 0880  3    could squeeze into their programs. This is no criticism
B27 0890  1    of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program
B27 0890 12    into a fifteen-minute news summary.
B27 0900  3       The radio stations did run "transcripts" (I thought)
B27 0910  3    during the evening hours. However, by comparing the
B27 0920  2    TV snatches, two different radio station re-runs,
B27 0920 10    and the censored Los Angeles Times version, I found
B27 0930  7    that the radio stations had edited out questions (ABC
B27 0940  6    removed the one regarding Laos) or even a paragraph
B27 0950  5    out of the middle of the President's answer. I am interested
B27 0960  4    to know he is getting mail from all over the country
B27 0970  1    about the "abuse" he is being subjected to. We out
B27 0970 11    here don't see enough of the conference to know he
B27 0980  9    is being abused.
B27 0980 12       I don't know if this is the situation in other parts
B27 0990 10    of the country; apparently it is not. It also happened
B27 1000  7    with the Inauguration, which was not re-run at all
B27 1010  6    during the evening hours, and I wrote to the TV editor
B27 1020  2    of the Times. He did mention in his column the fact
B27 1020 13    that he had received many letters about this and he
B27 1030 10    himself did not understand the networks and the independent
B27 1040  6    local stations' not doing this- but nothing happened.
B27 1050  6       Can you bring the networks' attention to this? @
B27 1060  4    #FOR A COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA#
B27 1060  9    I WAS INTERESTED in James Webb Young's MADISON AVENUE
B27 1070  7    column in which he raised the question "Do We Need
B27 1080  8    a College of Propaganda"? [SR, Feb. 11].
B27 1090  4       In my estimation, we definitely do; and the sad
B27 1100  5    part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into
B27 1110  1    excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.
B27 1110 10       During the war, we set up schools for the teaching
B27 1120 10    of psychological warfare, which included the teaching
B27 1130  5    of propaganda, both black and white and the various
B27 1140  2    shades of grey in between. We had a couple of schools
B27 1140 13    in this country, the principal one being on the Marshall
B27 1150  9    Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck. There were also a
B27 1160  8    couple in Canada, and several in England. The English
B27 1170  5    schools preceded ours, and by the time we got into
B27 1180  3    it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda
B27 1190  1    and its teaching.
B27 1190  4       Four of us here in the United States attended, first
B27 1200  2    as students, then as instructors, almost every one
B27 1200 10    of these schools, in England, Canada, and the United
B27 1210  8    States. We set up the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out
B27 1220  7    its curriculum, and taught there. Toward the end of
B27 1230  5    the war, we really felt that we had learned something
B27 1240  1    about propaganda and how to teach it.
B27 1240  8       When the end did come, and the schools were disbanded
B27 1250  7    and abandoned, we felt and hoped that the machinery
B27 1260  4    of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.
B27 1270  1    We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might
B27 1270  9    be put on some sort of reserve list and called back
B27 1280  8    for refresher courses each year or so. Alas, no such
B27 1290  6    thing happened. There apparently is no school of propaganda
B27 1300  2    or psychological warfare. A study at the Pentagon and
B27 1300 11    at the service academies revealed that nothing was
B27 1310  8    being done there. And not one of the four men who attended
B27 1320  9    all the schools has ever been called on to apply any
B27 1330  6    of his knowledge in any way. @
B27 1330 13       CONGRATULATIONS on the article "Do We Need a College
B27 1340  9    of Propaganda"? This is one of the most constructive
B27 1350  8    suggestions made in this critical field in years, and
B27 1360  6    I certainly hope it sparks some action. @
B27 1370  2    #LET THE MEDIA CLEAN HOUSE, TOO#
B27 1370  8    MANY OF US in public relations were flattered that
B27 1380  5    Richard L. Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the
B27 1390  4    March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of
B27 1400  2    the Public Relations Society of America and the American
B27 1400 11    Public Relations Association.
B27 1420  1    #SNOW STORM#
B27 1420  3    I WAS SURPRISED and sorry to find in your issue of
B27 1430  2    March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that
B27 1430 13    had not yet been published.
B27 1440  3       Whether in his forthcoming book C. P. Snow commits
B27 1450  2    the errors of judgment and of fact with which your
B27 1450 12    heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important.
B27 1460  7    One should be able to get hold of the book at once.
B27 1470  9    But the attack was made from an advance copy. If this
B27 1480  4    practice should take root and spread, the man who submits
B27 1490  2    a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed
B27 1490 11    before he is accepted and publication will become a
B27 1500  9    sort of post-mortem formality. @
B27 1510  2       EDITOR'S NOTE: Sir Robert Watson-Watt wrote, on
B27 1520  3    page 50 of SR/ Research for 4 March 1961: "I have
B27 1530  2    read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be
B27 1530 14    titled, 'Science and Government'. Until the work actually
B27 1540  7    appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly
B27 1550  7    in detail. But I have compared its text with already
B27 1560  5    published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin
B27 1570  1    lectures at Harvard, from which the book was derived,
B27 1570 10    and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C.
B27 1580  8    P. Snow's incautious tale".
B27 1590  2       Watson-Watt's remarks in SR did not then, constitute
B27 1600  2    a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures.
B27 1610  1    Representatives of Harvard University Press, which
B27 1610  7    is publishing the book this month of April, recognize
B27 1620  8    and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction
B27 1630  6    by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from
B27 1640  4    the book in advance of the book's publication date.
B27 1650  1    The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression
B27 1650 11    than the prepublication excerpt.
B27 1660  3    ##
B27 1660  4    SIR ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S "rebuttal" of Sir Charles
B27 1670  4    Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too
B27 1680  3    forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently
B27 1680 11    himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while
B27 1690  7    stating those "falsehoods" in an unclear incoherent
B27 1700  5    argument.
B27 1700  6       The article presents the reader with an absurdity
B27 1710  7    at its beginning. It calls the conclusion admitted
B27 1720  3    valid by "historians and military strategists alike"
B27 1730  1    a "perverted conclusion. ... nonsense".
B27 1730  6       It submits an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception
B27 1740  5    of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man,
B27 1750  6    but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles'
B27 1760  2    account. We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.
B27 1770  1       The only fact that holds any weight in the article
B27 1770 11    is the result of the tea party. But we are to believe
B27 1780 11    that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the
B27 1790  5    Tizard Committee, and dissembling, discounted it inside?
B27 1800  4    If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the
B27 1810  3    man.
B27 1810  4       I think it was a grave error to print the article
B27 1820  2    at this time. To the unfortunate people unable to attend
B27 1820 12    the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura
B27 1830  8    of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some
B27 1840  6    people from reading it. @
