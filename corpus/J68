J68 0010  1    RECENT CRITICISM OF Great Expectations has tended to
J68 0010  9    emphasize its symbolic and mythic content, to show,
J68 0020  8    as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally, that
J68 0030  6    much of the novel's impact resides in its "allegoric
J68 0040  4    insight and moral metaphor". J. H. Miller's excellent
J68 0050  2    chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated
J68 0060  1    how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective.
J68 0070  1    In his analysis, however, he touches upon but fails
J68 0070 10    to explore an idea, generally neglected in discussions
J68 0080  5    of the book, which I believe is central to its art-
J68 0090  5    the importance of human hands as a recurring feature
J68 0100  1    of the narrative. This essay seeks to make that exploration.
J68 0100 11       Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical
J68 0110  9    of the great Victorian writers. He knew instinctively
J68 0120  5    that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his
J68 0130  5    most useful possession- that in fiction as in the theatre,
J68 0140  4    gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing
J68 0150  1    character and dramatizing action and response. It is
J68 0150  9    hardly accidental, therefore, that many of his most
J68 0160  7    vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with
J68 0170  4    their hands. In Great Expectations the hands become
J68 0180  2    almost an obsession. Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his
J68 0185  1    forefinger, a gesture which conveys both contempt and
J68 0190  8    the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates,
J68 0200  4    half terrifies all who have dealings with him. Miss
J68 0210  2    Havisham's withered hands, heavy as if her unhappiness
J68 0210 10    were somehow concentrated in them, move in restless
J68 0220  8    self-pity between her broken heart and her walking
J68 0230  6    stick. Pumblechook's "signature" is the perpetually
J68 0240  4    extended glad hand. Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction
J68 0250  1    by regularly rubbing his hands together. Old Mr. Pocket's
J68 0260  1    frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless,
J68 0260  9    social-climbing wife is to "put his two hands into
J68 0270  9    his disturbed hair" and "make an extraordinary effort
J68 0280  4    to lift himself up by it", (23) whereas Joe Gargery
J68 0290  3    endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically
J68 0300  1    drawing "the back of his hand across and across his
J68 0300 11    nose". (7)
J68 0310  2       Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark,
J68 0310 10    were it not that in Great Expectations, as in no other
J68 0320 10    of Dickens' novels, hands serve as a leitmotif of plot
J68 0330  8    and theme- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor
J68 0340  5    for the book's complex of human interrelationships
J68 0350  1    and the values and attitudes that motivate them. Dickens
J68 0360  1    not only reveals character through gesture, he makes
J68 0360  9    hands a crucial element of the plot, a means of clarifying
J68 0370  9    the structure of the novel by helping to define the
J68 0380  6    hero's relations with all the major characters, and
J68 0390  2    a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt,
J68 0390 11    pursuit, crime, greed, education, materialism, enslavement
J68 0400  6    (by both people and institutions), friendship, romantic
J68 0410  5    love, forgiveness, and redemption. We have only to
J68 0420  5    think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in
J68 0430  2    Thomas Burke's famous story, "The Hands of Mr. Ottermole",
J68 0440  1    to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime
J68 0440 11    and punishment. So it is with Great Expectations, whether
J68 0450  8    the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery
J68 0470  7    or Pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry. Such associations
J68 0480  7    suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects
J68 0490  4    of Dickens' novel, but, on a deeper plane, they relate
J68 0500  2    to the themes of sin, guilt, and pursuit that have
J68 0500 12    recently been analyzed by other critics.
J68 0510  6       The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically
J68 0520  3    trying to avoid the nemesis of being "laid hands on"-
J68 0530  1    (3) a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened
J68 0540  1    eyes in the churchyard "as if he were eluding the hands
J68 0540 12    of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of
J68 0550  7    their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull
J68 0560  6    him in". (1) Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a
J68 0570  3    pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's
J68 0570 14    imagination of a bogy man who may "softly creep ...
J68 0580 10    his way to him and tear him open", (1) "imbruing his
J68 0590  6    hands" (2) in him. As Pip agonizes over the theft that
J68 0600  5    his own hands have committed, his guilty conscience
J68 0610  1    projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost,
J68 0610 11    transforming it into "a phantom devoting me to the
J68 0620  9    Hulks". (3) Held upside down in the graveyard, Pip
J68 0630  7    clings in terror "with both hands" (1) to his convict;
J68 0640  5    later he flees in panic from the family table just
J68 0650  2    as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked
J68 0650 13    at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds
J68 0660  9    out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's
J68 0670  6    forge for mending. Through such details Dickens indicates
J68 0680  3    at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond
J68 0690  2    between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably
J68 0690 10    to alter both their lives.
J68 0700  4       Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings
J68 0710  2    into deeds, hands naturally represent action, and since
J68 0710 10    nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are
J68 0720  8    of the underworld or closely allied to it, the linking
J68 0730  8    of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered
J68 0740  6    at. Dickens, for excellent psychological reasons, never
J68 0750  2    fully reveals Magwitch's felonious past, but Pip, at
J68 0750 10    the convict's climactic reappearance in London, shrinks
J68 0760  7    from clasping a hand which he fears "might be stained
J68 0770  9    with blood". (39) Orlick slouches about the forge "like
J68 0780  6    Cain" with "his hands in his pockets", (15) and when
J68 0790  4    he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday,
J68 0800  4    she claps her hands in a tantrum, beats them "upon
J68 0800 14    her bosom and upon her knees", (15) and clenches them
J68 0810 10    in her husband's hair. This last "rampage" is only
J68 0820  7    the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head, "dealt
J68 0830  6    by some unknown hand" (15) whose identity is later
J68 0840  3    revealed not verbally but through a manual action-
J68 0840 11    the tracing of Orlick's hammer upon a slate. Pip himself
J68 0850  9    is to feel the terror of Orlick's "murderous hand"
J68 0860  6    (53) in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on
J68 0870  5    the marshes. Dickens lays great emphasis on the hands
J68 0880  3    in this scene. Orlick shakes his hand at Pip, bangs
J68 0880 13    the table with his fist, draws his unclenched hand
J68 0890  8    "across his mouth as if his mouth watered" for his
J68 0900  6    victim, lets his hands hang "loose and heavy at his
J68 0910  4    sides", and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows
J68 0920  1    "of the slightest action of his fingers". (53) Orlick
J68 0920 10    might almost be Magwitch's bogy man come alive, a figure
J68 0930  9    of nemesis from Pip's phantasy of guilt.
J68 0940  4       The scarred, disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers' housekeeper
J68 0950  3    are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past, for her
J68 0960  4    master, coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests,
J68 0960 12    makes a point of the "force of grip there is in these
J68 0970 12    hands". (26) Jaggers' iron control over her ("... she
J68 0980  7    would remove her hands from any dish she put before
J68 0990  6    him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her
J68 1000  2    back ...".) (26) rests on his having once got her acquitted
J68 1010  1    of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves
J68 1010 10    at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing
J68 1020  7    off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the
J68 1030  6    scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails.
J68 1040  1    It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's
J68 1050  1    ("The action of her fingers was like the action of
J68 1050 11    knitting") (48) that provides Pip with a vital clue
J68 1060  8    to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic
J68 1070  4    connection between the underworld of crime and the
J68 1080  2    genteel cruelty of Satis House. Finally, Magwitch's
J68 1080  9    pursuit of Compeyson, his archenemy and betrayer, begins
J68 1090  8    by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river
J68 1100  8    flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his
J68 1110  3    "laying his hand on his cloak to identify him", (54)
J68 1120  1    thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the
J68 1120  9    water during which Compeyson drowns. Magwitch's hand
J68 1130  5    here ironically becomes the agent of justice.
J68 1140  3       But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations
J68 1150  1    a tale of violence, revenge, and retribution. Money,
J68 1150  9    so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens, is here
J68 1160  9    central, and hands are often associated in some way
J68 1170  6    with the false values- acquisitiveness, snobbery, self-interest,
J68 1180  4    hypocrisy, toadyism, irresponsibility, injustice- that
J68 1190  4    attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth.
J68 1195  1    Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society
J68 1200  8    on the first page of his novel in the description of
J68 1210  8    Pip's five little dead brothers "who gave up trying
J68 1220  5    to get a living exceedingly early in that universal
J68 1230  1    struggle", who seemed to have "all been born on their
J68 1230 11    backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and
J68 1240  9    had never taken them out in this state of existence".
J68 1250  6    (1) Pip's great expectations, his progress through
J68 1260  3    illusion and disillusionment, turn, somewhat as they
J68 1270  1    do for the naive hero of Dreiser's American Tragedy,
J68 1270 10    upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned
J68 1290  7    income- what Wemmick calls "portable property" and
J68 1300  4    what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting "slip through
J68 1310  3    [his] fingers". (55)
J68 1310  6       Since a gentleman must, if possible, avoid sullying
J68 1320  6    them by work, his hands, as importantly as his accent,
J68 1330  4    become the index of social status. Almost the first
J68 1340  1    step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy
J68 1340 11    shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness
J68 1350  8    of his hands: "They had never troubled me before, but
J68 1360  7    they troubled me now, as vulgar appendages". (8) Pip
J68 1370  4    imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands,
J68 1380  3    roughened by work in the smithy, and the deliberate
J68 1380 12    contrast between her white hands and his blackened
J68 1390  8    ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values
J68 1400  5    between which Pip struggles- idleness and work, artificiality
J68 1410  4    and naturalness, gentility and commonness, coldness
J68 1420  1    and affection- in fact, between Satis House and the
J68 1420 10    forge. When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe
J68 1430  9    finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force
J68 1440  6    of love, the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake
J68 1450  3    at which Pip exclaims "No, don't wipe it off- for God's
J68 1460  3    sake, give me your blackened hand"! (35)
J68 1470  1       Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham, during
J68 1470  9    which he kneels to kiss her hand, signalizes his homage
J68 1480  8    to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up
J68 1490  6    for him a new world of glamour; when, on the journey
J68 1500  2    to London that immediately follows, he pauses nostalgically
J68 1510  1    to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of
J68 1510 13    the village, the wooden pointer symbolically designates
J68 1520  4    a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption
J68 1530  4    of worldly vanity. Incidentally, one cannot miss the
J68 1540  3    significance of this gesture, for Dickens reintroduces
J68 1540 10    it associatively in Pip's mind at another moral and
J68 1550  8    psychological crisis- his painful recognition, in a
J68 1560  8    talk with Herbert Pocket, that his hopeless attachment
J68 1570  3    to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic.
J68 1580  1    In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened
J68 1580 10    awareness of contrary magnetisms.
J68 1590  4       A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the
J68 1600  3    moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond
J68 1610  1    the forge. The vulturelike attendance of the Pocket
J68 1610  9    family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical
J68 1620  9    gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket, who puts her hand
J68 1630  6    to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken
J68 1640  3    choking, then lays it "upon her heaving bosom" with
J68 1650  1    "an unnatural fortitude of manner", (11) and finally
J68 1650  9    kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's
J68 1660  9    own mannerism toward Estella. Pumblechook's hands throughout
J68 1670  4    the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical
J68 1680  3    self-aggrandizement. We first see him shaking Mrs.
J68 1690  1    Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the
J68 1690 10    premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as
J68 1700  8    an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands "for the
J68 1710  5    hundredth time at least" ("May I- may I-"?) (19) in
J68 1720  7    effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations.
J68 1730  3    We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's
J68 1740  1    loss of fortune, extending his hand "with a magnificently
J68 1740 10    forgiving air" and exhibiting "the same fat five fingers",
J68 1750  9    one of which he identifies with "the finger of Providence"
J68 1760  8    and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's
J68 1770  8    "ingratitoode" and his own generosity as Pip's "earliest
J68 1780  7    benefactor". (58)
J68 1790  1       Pip first learns "the stupendous power of money"
J68 1790  9    from the sycophantic tailor, Mr. Trabb, whose brutality
J68 1800  7    to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource
J68 1820  4    of each new customer, and whose fawning hands touch
J68 1830  3    "the outside of each elbow" (19) and "rub" Pip out
J68 1840  3    of the shop. The respectability which money confers
J68 1840 11    implies a different etiquette, and, upon taking up
J68 1850  8    the life of a London gentleman, Pip must learn from
J68 1860  5    Herbert Pocket that "the spoon is not generally used
J68 1870  2    over-hand, but under".
