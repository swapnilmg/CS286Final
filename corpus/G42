G42 0010  1       Impressive as this enumeration is, it barely hints
G42 0010  9    at the diverse perceptions of Jews, collectively or
G42 0020  6    individually, that have been attested by their Gentile
G42 0030  5    environment. It is reasonable to affirm two propositions:
G42 0040  3    Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things
G42 0050  1    to all men; some Jews have in fact been all things
G42 0050 12    to all men. In the arena of power Jews have at one
G42 0060 10    time or another been somebody's ally; they have observed
G42 0070  5    correct neutrality; they have been someone's enemy.
G42 0080  3    In the market place Jews have in fact under various
G42 0090  1    circumstances been valued customers and suppliers,
G42 0090  7    or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors.
G42 0100  4    And so on through the roles referred to in the previous
G42 0110  5    paragraph. Diversity of perception, yes; diversity
G42 0120  1    of fact, yes.
G42 0120  4       But the two do not invariably or even typically
G42 0130  2    coincide. The "conventional" image of a particular
G42 0130  9    time and place is not necessarily congruent with the
G42 0140  9    image of the facts as established over the years by
G42 0150  6    scholarly and scientific research. Conventional images
G42 0160  2    of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of
G42 0170  1    a configuration in which one feature is held constant:
G42 0170 10    images can be both true and false.
G42 0180  5       The genuinely interesting question, then, becomes:
G42 0190  2    What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion
G42 0200  1    in conventional images of Jews? The working test of
G42 0200 10    "the facts" must always be the best available description
G42 0210  8    obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied
G42 0220  6    their methods of investigation to relevant situations.
G42 0230  4    Granted, such "functional" images are subject to human
G42 0240  3    error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they
G42 0250  1    are subject to disciplined procedures that check and
G42 0250  9    recheck against error.
G42 0260  2       In accounting for realism or distortion two sets
G42 0260 10    of factors can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence;
G42 0270  7    predispositions regarding intelligence. General Grant
G42 0280  5    may have been the victim of false information in the
G42 0290  6    instance reported in this book; if so, he would not
G42 0300  4    be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed
G42 0310  1    to bad information and dubious estimates of the future.
G42 0310 10    But General Grant may have been self-victimized. He
G42 0320  8    may have entered the situation with predispositions
G42 0330  3    that prepared him to act uncritically in the press
G42 0340  2    of affairs.
G42 0340  4       Predispositions, in turn, fall conveniently into
G42 0360  2    two categories for purposes of analysis. To some extent
G42 0360 11    predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments.
G42 0370  8    In some measure they depend upon the structure of individual
G42 0380  8    personality. The anti-Semitism of Hitler owed something
G42 0390  5    to his exposure to the ideology of Lueger's politically
G42 0400  3    successful Christian socialist movement in Vienna.
G42 0410  1    But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's
G42 0410 10    propaganda and record. After allowing for group exposures,
G42 0420  8    it is apparent that other factors must be considered
G42 0430  7    if we are to comprehend fanaticism. These are personality
G42 0440  4    factors; they include harmonies and conflicts within
G42 0450  2    the whole man, and mechanisms whereby inner components
G42 0450 10    are more or less smoothly met. Modern psychiatric knowledge
G42 0460  9    provides us with many keys to unlock the significance
G42 0470  8    of behavior of the kind.
G42 0480  1       The foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis
G42 0480  9    of perceptual images and the broad conditions under
G42 0490  7    which they achieve realism or fall short of it. Undoubtedly
G42 0500  6    one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile conceptions
G42 0510  2    of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that
G42 0520  1    it provides a formidable body of material that invites
G42 0520 10    critical examination in terms of reality. Many selections
G42 0530  7    are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal.
G42 0540  5       Undoubtedly, however, the significance of the volume
G42 0550  4    is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest. Speaking
G42 0560  2    as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution
G42 0560 12    is in the realm of future policy. Since we can neither
G42 0570 11    undo nor redo the past, we are limited to the events
G42 0580  8    of today and tomorrow. In this domain the simple fact
G42 0590  5    of coexistence in the same local, national, and world
G42 0600  2    community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain
G42 0600 11    from having some effect, large or small, upon Gentile-Jewish
G42 0610  9    relations. What shall these effects be?
G42 0620  5       I am deliberately raising the policy problems involved
G42 0630  3    in Gentile-Jewish relations. Comprehensive examination
G42 0640  1    of any policy question calls for the performance of
G42 0640 10    the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving
G42 0650  7    method. The tasks are briefly indicated by these questions:
G42 0660  7    What are my goals in Gentile-Jewish relations? What
G42 0670  3    are the historical trends in this country and abroad
G42 0680  3    in the extent to which these goals are effectively
G42 0680 12    realized? What factors condition the degree of realization
G42 0690  8    at various times and places? What is the probable course
G42 0700  9    of future developments? What policies if adopted and
G42 0710  6    applied in various circumstances will increase the
G42 0720  3    likelihood that future events will coincide with desired
G42 0730  1    events and do so at least cost in terms of all human
G42 0730 13    values?
G42 0740  1       It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover
G42 0740 11    policy questions of such depth and range. The discussion
G42 0750  8    is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing
G42 0760  5    at least some of the potential importance of this volume
G42 0770  4    for future policy. As a groundwork for the proposal
G42 0780  1    I give some attention to the first task enumerated
G42 0780 10    above, the clarification of goal.
G42 0790  3       My reply is that I associate myself with all those
G42 0800  3    who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute
G42 0810  1    to the theory and practice of human dignity. The basic
G42 0810 11    goal finds partial expression in the Universal Declaration
G42 0820  6    of Human Rights, a statement initiated and endorsed
G42 0830  4    by individuals and organizations of many religious
G42 0840  2    and philosophical traditions.
G42 0840  5       Within this frame of reference policies appropriate
G42 0850  4    to claims advanced in the name of the Jews depend upon
G42 0860  4    which Jewish identity is involved, as well as upon
G42 0870  1    the nature of the claim, the characteristics of the
G42 0870 10    claimant, the justifications proposed, and the predispositions
G42 0880  5    of the community decision makers who are called upon
G42 0890  6    to act. If Jews are identified as a religious body
G42 0900  2    in a controversy that comes before a national or international
G42 0910  1    tribunal, it is obviously compatible with the goal
G42 0910  9    of human dignity to protect freedom of worship. When
G42 0920  7    decision makers act within this frame they determine
G42 0930  4    whether a claim put forward in the name of religion
G42 0940  1    is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate
G42 0940 11    to religion. Since the recognition of Israel as a nation
G42 0950  9    state, claims are made in many cases which identify
G42 0960  6    the claimant as a member of the new body politic. Community
G42 0970  3    decision makers must make up their minds whether a
G42 0980  2    claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms
G42 0980 11    of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation
G42 0990  6    states. In free countries many controversies involve
G42 1000  4    self-styled Jews who use the symbol in asserting a
G42 1010  2    vaguely "cultural" rather than religious or political
G42 1010  9    identity. The decision maker who acts for the community
G42 1020  9    as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued
G42 1030  6    and the methods used are appropriate to public policy
G42 1040  4    regarding cultural groups.
G42 1040  7       We know that much is made of the multiplicity and
G42 1050  8    ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the
G42 1060  4    key symbol of the Jew. Many public and private controversies
G42 1070  1    will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions
G42 1070  8    in the mind and usage of Gentile and Jew. However,
G42 1080 10    in the context of legal and civic policy, these controversies
G42 1090  6    are less than novel. They involve similar uncertainties
G42 1100  4    regarding the multiple identities of any number of
G42 1110  3    non-Jewish groups. So far as the existing body of formal
G42 1120  1    principle and procedure is concerned, categorical novelties
G42 1120  8    are not to be anticipated in Jewish-Gentile relationships;
G42 1130  8    claims are properly disposed of according to norms
G42 1140  6    common to all parties.
G42 1140 10       It is not implied that formal principles and procedures
G42 1150  9    are so firmly entrenched within the public order of
G42 1160  6    the world community or even of free commonwealths that
G42 1170  3    they will control in all circumstances involving Jews
G42 1180  1    and Gentiles during coming years. Social process is
G42 1180  9    always anchored in past predisposition; but it is perennially
G42 1190  8    restructured in situations where anchors are dragged
G42 1200  5    or lost. In conformance with the maximization principle
G42 1210  3    we affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations will be harmonious
G42 1220  3    or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or
G42 1220 12    the other is expected by the active participants to
G42 1230  9    yield the greatest net advantage, taking all value
G42 1240  5    outcomes and effects into consideration. It is not
G42 1250  4    difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative
G42 1250 11    tensions will cumulate; for instance, imagine the situation
G42 1260  8    if Israel ever joins an enemy coalition. The formal
G42 1270  8    position of Americans who identify themselves with
G42 1280  4    one or more of the several identities of the Jewish
G42 1290  2    symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal
G42 1290 11    factors cannot be so easily assessed.
G42 1300  6       When we consider the disorganized state of the world
G42 1310  5    community, and the legacy of predispositions adversely
G42 1320  1    directed against all who are identified as Jews, it
G42 1320 10    is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles
G42 1330  9    of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor
G42 1340  4    and skill. During moments of intense crisis the responsibility
G42 1350  3    of political leaders is overwhelming. But their freedom
G42 1360  2    of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition
G42 1360 11    with which they and the people around them enter the
G42 1370  9    crisis. At such critical moments predispositions favorable
G42 1380  4    to human dignity most obviously "pay off". By the same
G42 1390  5    test predispositions destructive of human personality
G42 1400  1    exercise their most sinister impact, with the result
G42 1400  9    that men of good will are often trapped and nullified.
G42 1410  9       Among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans
G42 1420  7    to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision
G42 1430  4    makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive
G42 1440  3    effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are
G42 1440 11    also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened
G42 1450 10    leaders near the limit of self-control. We are learning
G42 1460  9    how to do these things in some of the vast organized
G42 1470  7    structures of modern society; the process can be accelerated.
G42 1480  4       A truism is that the time to prepare for the worst
G42 1490  4    is when times are best. During intercrisis periods
G42 1490 12    the educational facilities of the community have the
G42 1500  8    possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering
G42 1510  5    the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every
G42 1520  4    age and condition. As more men and women are made capable
G42 1530  1    of living up to the challenge of decency the chances
G42 1530 11    are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing
G42 1540  7    in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably
G42 1550  7    affected.
G42 1550  8       Now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the
G42 1560  6    foregoing is that they appear to preach; and in contemporary
G42 1570  4    society we often complain of too much reaffirmation
G42 1580  1    of the goodness of the good. In any case I do not intend
G42 1580 14    to let the present occasion pass without dealing more
G42 1590  9    directly with the problem of implementing good intentions.
G42 1600  6    I assume that the number of readers of this anthology
G42 1610  5    who regard themselves as morally perfect is small,
G42 1620  2    and that most readers are willing to consider procedures
G42 1620 11    by which they may gain more insight into themselves
G42 1630  8    and better understanding of others. Properly used,
G42 1640  5    the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment.
G42 1650  3       Let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective
G42 1660  3    or the method "psychoanalytic", for this is a well
G42 1660 12    established term of art for the specific ideas and
G42 1670  9    procedures initiated by Sigmund Freud and his followers
G42 1680  7    for the study and treatment of disordered personalities.
G42 1690  2    The traditional method proceeds by the technique of
G42 1700  2    free association, punctuated by interpretations proposed
G42 1700  8    by the psychoanalytic interviewer.
G42 1710  3       What we have in mind does have something in common
G42 1720  4    with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods
G42 1730  1    by which they are sought. For what we propose, however,
G42 1730 11    a psychoanalyst is not necessary, even though one aim
G42 1740  8    is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses-
G42 1750  6    his defenses of himself to himself. For this purpose
G42 1760  4    a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement
G42 1760 11    is necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied
G42 1770  8    by a special frame of mind.
G42 1780  3       The relatively long and often colorful selections
G42 1790  1    in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely
G42 1790 10    absorbed in what is said, whether he responds with
G42 1800  8    anger or applause. But simple involvement is not enough;
G42 1810  5    self-discovery calls for an open, permissive, inquiring
G42 1820  2    posture of self-observation.
G42 1820  6       The symposium provides an opportunity to confront
G42 1830  5    the self with specific statements which were made at
G42 1840  4    particular times by identifiable communicators who
G42 1840 10    were addressing definite audiences- and throughout
G42 1850  6    several hundred pages everyone is talking about the
G42 1860  6    same key symbol of identification.
G42 1870  1       An advantage of being exposed to such specificity
G42 1870  9    about an important and recurring feature of social
G42 1880  6    reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the
G42 1890  4    reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances
G42 1900  1    within himself, resonances triggered by explicit symbols
G42 1900  8    clustering around the central figure of the Jew.
