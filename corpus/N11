N11 0010  1       The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing.
N11 0010 12    For men who had left cattle alone after getting their
N11 0020 10    first notices had received no second. But the day of
N11 0030  8    the deadline came and passed, and the men who had scoffed
N11 0040  6    at the warnings laughed with satisfaction. For, with
N11 0050  2    a single exception, nothing had happened to them.
N11 0050 10       The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named
N11 0060  8    William Lewis. After walking out to his corral that
N11 0070  7    morning, he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in
N11 0080  5    front of his feet. A split second later, the distant
N11 0090  1    crack of a rifle had sounded. He'd mounted up immediately
N11 0090 11    and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from
N11 0100  9    which he'd estimated the shot had come. But he had
N11 0110  7    found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted.
N11 0120  3    There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or
N11 0130  1    trace to show that anyone had been near.
N11 0130  9       Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of
N11 0140  7    cow stealing. He hadn't even pretended to be farming
N11 0150  3    his spread. His land had never been plowed. He had
N11 0150 13    done his rustling openly and boasted about it. He had
N11 0160 10    received both first and second anonymous notices, and
N11 0170  6    each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them.
N11 0180  4    He had cursed at them and threatened them. He was a
N11 0190  2    man, those neighbors testified later, who didn't have
N11 0190 10    a friend in the world.
N11 0200  4       William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near
N11 0210  2    him again, that August morning after a bullet landed
N11 0210 11    at his feet, and once more he accused and threatened
N11 0220  8    everyone.
N11 0220  9       "I'll be ready next time"! he raged. "I'll be shootin'
N11 0230 10    right back".
N11 0240  1       He had his chance the very next morning, for exactly
N11 0240 11    the same thing happened again. This time Lewis had
N11 0250  9    his own rifle in his hands, and he threw some answering
N11 0260  7    fire back at the mysterious far-off shot, then spent
N11 0270  4    most of the day searching out the area. He found nothing,
N11 0280  1    but he still refused to give up and move out.
N11 0280 11       "Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin'
N11 0290  9    coward face-to-face"! he exploded. "That's all I ask"!
N11 0300  7       He never got that chance. For the unseen, ghostlike
N11 0310  6    rifleman aimed a little higher the third time. A .30-30
N11 0320  6    bullet smashed directly into the center of William
N11 0330  1    Lewis' chest. He slumped against a log fence rail,
N11 0330 10    then tried to lift himself. Two more shots followed
N11 0340  8    in quick succession, dropping him limp and huddled
N11 0350  5    on the ground.
N11 0350  8       An inquest was held, and after a good deal of testimony
N11 0360  7    about the anonymous notes, the county coroner estimated
N11 0370  3    that the shooting had been done from a distance of
N11 0380  1    300 yards. Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at
N11 0380 12    the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out
N11 0390  6    by then, and as a grand jury investigation of the murder
N11 0400  5    got underway, the prosecuting attorney, a Colonel Baird,
N11 0410  4    ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for
N11 0420  1    questioning.
N11 0420  2       It took some time to locate Horn. He was finally
N11 0430  1    found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County, two
N11 0430 11    counties away. Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed
N11 0440  6    he was hiding out there after the shooting and began
N11 0450  6    preparing an indictment. But that indictment was never
N11 0460  3    made. For Tom Horn, it turned out, had a number of
N11 0470  1    rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear
N11 0470 10    with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole
N11 0480  9    the day of the killing.
N11 0490  1       The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken. The
N11 0490  9    authorities had to release him. He immediately rode
N11 0500  7    on to Cheyenne, threw a ten-day drinking spree and
N11 0510  4    dropped some very strong hints among friends.
N11 0520  1       "Dead center at three hundred yards, that coroner
N11 0520  9    said"! he'd grin. "Three shots in that fella 'fore
N11 0530  8    he hit the ground! You reckon there's two men in this
N11 0540  7    state can shoot like that"?
N11 0550  1       Publicly, he denied everything. Privately, he created
N11 0550  8    and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin.
N11 0560  9    For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound
N11 0570  7    of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd
N11 0580  4    promised to do.
N11 0580  7    ##
N11 0580  8    Tom Horn was soon back at work, giving his secret employers
N11 0590  5    their money's worth. A good many beef-hungry settlers
N11 0600  2    were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof
N11 0610  1    that the warning notes were not idle threats. The company
N11 0610 11    herds were being raided less often, and cabins and
N11 0620  8    soddies all over the range were standing deserted.
N11 0630  3    But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis
N11 0640  2    murder off as a personal grudge killing, the work of
N11 0640 12    one of his neighbors. The rustling problem was by no
N11 0650  8    means solved.
N11 0650 10       Even in the very area where the shooting had been
N11 0660 10    done, cattle were still disappearing. For less than
N11 0670  5    a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man
N11 0680  4    lived another settler who had ignored the warnings
N11 0680 12    that his existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant
N11 0690  8    and defiant rustler named Fred Powell.
N11 0700  3       "Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in
N11 0710  3    cattle" his own hired man, Andy Ross, mentioned later.
N11 0720  1    "Everyone knew it, but he sort of acted like he didn't
N11 0720 12    care who knew it- even after them notes came, even
N11 0730 10    after he'd heard about Lewis, even after he'd been
N11 0740  6    shot at a couple o' times hisself"!
N11 0750  1       On the morning of September 10, 1895, Powell and
N11 0750 10    Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work. Haying
N11 0760 10    time was close at hand, and they needed some strong
N11 0770  7    branches to repair a hay rack. Harnessing a team to
N11 0780  4    a buckboard, they drove out to a willow-lined creek
N11 0790  1    about a half-mile off, then climbed down and began
N11 0790 11    chopping.
N11 0800  1       Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his
N11 0800 10    second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded.
N11 0810  7    He looked around in surprise, then noticed that Fred
N11 0820  4    Powell was clutching his chest. The hired man ran over
N11 0830  3    to help his boss.
N11 0830  7       "My God, I'm shot"! Powell gasped. And he collapsed
N11 0840  5    and died instantly.
N11 0840  8       Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin.
N11 0850  7    He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard, yelled and
N11 0860  5    lashed at the team and got out of there fast. But he
N11 0870  3    brought back the sheriff and several deputies, and
N11 0870 11    to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition
N11 0880  7    of the Lewis killing.
N11 0890  1       A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed
N11 0890  9    nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been
N11 0900  8    the rifleman's hiding place. There were no tracks of
N11 0910  5    either hoofs or boots. Not even an empty cartridge
N11 0920  1    case could be found.
N11 0920  5       Once again, Tom Horn was the first and most likely
N11 0930  4    suspect, and he was brought in for questioning immediately.
N11 0940  1    Once again, he shook his head, kept his face expressionless
N11 0940 11    and his voice very calm, and had a strongly supported
N11 0950 10    alibi ready. Later, riding in for some lusty enjoyment
N11 0960  7    of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne,
N11 0970  3    he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations
N11 0980  1    he made.
N11 0980  3       "Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition
N11 0990  2    with me", he'd blandly announce. "And I sort o' got
N11 1000  2    a corner on the market".
N11 1000  7       "Tom", a friend asked him once, "how come you bushwhacked
N11 1010  6    them rustlers? They wouldn't o' stood no chance with
N11 1020  6    you in a plain, straight-out shoot-down".
N11 1030  1       He had lots of friends, then as always. Even as
N11 1030 11    he became widely known as a professional killer, nearly
N11 1040  7    every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to
N11 1050  5    call him a friend. No man's name brought more cheers
N11 1060  3    when it was announced in a rodeo.
N11 1060 10       "Well", he explained, "s'posin' you was a nester
N11 1070  6    swingin' the long rope? Which would you be most scairt
N11 1080  7    of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down"?
N11 1090  1       "Yeah, I can see that", the friend was forced to
N11 1100  1    agree. "But ... well, it just don't seem sportin' somehow"!
N11 1110  1       "Sportin'"! The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared
N11 1120  1    in amazement. "Sportin'"! he echoed again in soft wonder.
N11 1120 10    "I seen a lot o' things in my time. I found a trooper
N11 1130 13    once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill, and
N11 1140  9    another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught,
N11 1150  5    tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little
N11 1160  3    fires until their brains was exploded right out o'
N11 1170  1    their skulls. I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a
N11 1170 10    cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink
N11 1180  9    'em and squeeze him to death. But there's one thing
N11 1190  6    I never seen or heard of, one thing I just don't think
N11 1200  5    there is, and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man"!
N11 1210  3       After the first two murders, the warning notes were
N11 1220  2    rarely ignored. The lesson had been learned. The examples
N11 1220 11    were plain. When Fred Powell's brother-in-law, Charlie
N11 1230  9    Keane, moved into the dead man's home, the anonymous
N11 1240  8    letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up
N11 1250  5    where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first
N11 1260  4    notice:
N11 1260  5       IF YOU DON'T LEAVE THIS COUNTRY WITHIN 3 DAYS, YOUR
N11 1270  5    LIFE WILL BE TAKEN THE SAME AS POWELL'S WAS.
N11 1280  1       This was the message found tacked to the cabin door.
N11 1280 11    Keane left, within three days.
N11 1290  5       All through Albany and Laramie counties, other men
N11 1300  3    were doing the same. Houses of settlers who'd treated
N11 1310  1    the company herds as a natural resource, free for the
N11 1310 11    taking, were sitting empty, with weeds growing high
N11 1320  7    in their yards. The small half-heartedly tended fields
N11 1330  3    of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming
N11 1340  3    were lying fallow. No cow thief could count on a jury
N11 1350  1    of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer. Jury,
N11 1350 11    judge and executioner were riding the range in the
N11 1360  7    form of a single unknown figure that could materialize
N11 1370  4    anywhere, at any time, to dispense an ancient brand
N11 1380  2    of justice the men of the new West had believed long
N11 1380 13    outdated.
N11 1390  1    ##
N11 1390  2    For three straight years, Tom Horn patrolled the southern
N11 1390 11    Wyoming pastures, and how many men he killed after
N11 1400  9    Lewis and Powell (if he killed Lewis and Powell) will
N11 1410  8    never be known. It is possible, although highly doubtful,
N11 1420  4    that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation
N11 1430  3    work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder
N11 1440  1    in the state. It is also possible, but equally doubtful,
N11 1440 11    that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with
N11 1450  8    which his legend credits him.
N11 1460  1       For that legend was growing explosively, Rumor was
N11 1460  9    insisting he received a price of $600 a man. (The best
N11 1470 11    evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about
N11 1480  6    $125, very good money in an era when top hands worked
N11 1490  3    for $30 and found.) Rumor had it he slipped two small
N11 1500  1    rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark.
N11 1500 11    (A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to
N11 1510  8    substantiate this in the slightest.)
N11 1520  1       One thing was certain- his method was effective,
N11 1520  9    so effective that after a time even the warning notices
N11 1530 10    were often unnecessary. The mere fact that the tall
N11 1540  7    figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen
N11 1550  5    riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling
N11 1560  1    homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a
N11 1560 10    single week.
N11 1570  1       "My reputation's my stock in trade", Tom mentioned
N11 1570  9    more than once. He evidently couldn't foresee that
N11 1580  8    it might be his downfall in the end.
N11 1590  4       He had made himself the personification of the Devil
N11 1600  2    to the homesteaders. But to the cattlemen who had been
N11 1600 12    facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys
N11 1610  9    who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier,
N11 1620  8    he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary
N11 1630  4    figure. Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler
N11 1640  2    brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even
N11 1640 12    while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties
N11 1650 10    unknown. He made their spreads his headquarters, and
N11 1660  5    he helped out in their roundups.
N11 1670  1       In the cow camps, Tom Horn was regarded as a hero,
N11 1670 12    as the same kind of champion he was when he entered
N11 1680  9    and invariably won the local rodeos. The hands and
N11 1690  5    their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range,
N11 1700  1    waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society
N11 1700 10    that was threatening a beloved way of life. The wailing,
N11 1710  9    guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made
N11 1720  6    up songs about him.
N11 1720 10       By 1898, rustling losses had been driven down to
N11 1730  8    the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming.
