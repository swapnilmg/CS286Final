D05 0010  1       Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist
D05 0010  7    thinking, it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity
D05 0020  8    has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons
D05 0030  6    it dislikes. The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive
D05 0040  3    club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then
D05 0040 12    understood in the Back Bay- and Parker was definitely
D05 0050  9    not a gentleman, either in theology or in manners.
D05 0060  7    Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable representative of
D05 0070  3    the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the issue
D05 0080  2    in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted
D05 0080 11    or calumniated and that in this republic no power to
D05 0090  9    restrain him by force could exist. Even so, Gannett
D05 0100  6    judiciously argued, the Association could legitimately
D05 0110  2    decide that Parker "should not be encouraged nor assisted
D05 0120  2    in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from
D05 0120 11    him in regard to their correctness". We today are not
D05 0130  8    entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker
D05 0140  6    to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits
D05 0150  4    against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations.
D05 0160  1    One can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-
D05 0170  3    that every justification existed for their returning
D05 0170 10    the Public Lecture to the First Church, and so to suppress
D05 0180  9    it, rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board
D05 0190  7    for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy
D05 0200  4    it. Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen,
D05 0210  1    as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his
D05 0210 10    father, they had always contended for the propriety
D05 0220  8    of their claim to the title of Christians. Their demand
D05 0230  5    against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty
D05 0240  3    had never meant that they would follow "free inquiry"
D05 0250  1    to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a "natural"
D05 0250  9    religion.
D05 0260  1       Grant all this- still, when modern Unitarianism
D05 0260  8    and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous
D05 0270  8    affection the insults Parker lavished upon them, or
D05 0280  6    else argue that after all Parker received the treatment
D05 0290  4    he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience. Whenever
D05 0300  2    New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic
D05 0300 10    confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January
D05 0310  8    23, 1843- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler
D05 0320  7    Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association,
D05 0330  4    while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every
D05 0340  3    warrant for stating, "The difference between Trinitarians
D05 0350  1    and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity; the
D05 0350  9    difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is
D05 0360  8    a difference between no Christianity and Christianity"-
D05 0370  6    despite these supposed conclusive assurances, the modern
D05 0380  5    liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief, of positive
D05 0390  5    thanksgiving, that the Association never quite brought
D05 0400  2    itself officially to expel Parker. Had it done so,
D05 0400 11    the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible,
D05 0410  8    nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today
D05 0420  5    to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting
D05 0430  4    down on its collective knees and crying "peccavi".
D05 0440  1       Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association
D05 0440  8    did not actually command Parker to leave the room,
D05 0450  9    though it came too close for comfort to what would
D05 0460  6    have been an unforgivable brutality. Fortunately, the
D05 0470  2    honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol
D05 0480  1    defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and
D05 0480  9    Chandler Robbins; whereupon Parker broke down into
D05 0490  7    convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room,
D05 0500  6    though not out of the Fellowship. In the hall, after
D05 0510  3    adjournment, Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the
D05 0511  1    hand and requested Parker to visit him- whereupon our
D05 0520  9    burly Theodore again burst into tears.
D05 0530  5       All this near tragedy, which to us borders on comedy,
D05 0540  3    enables us to tell the story over and over again, always
D05 0550  1    warming ourselves with a glow of complacency. It was
D05 0550 10    indeed a near thing, but somehow the inherent decency
D05 0560  7    of New England (which we inherit) did triumph. Parker
D05 0570  4    was never excommunicated. To the extent that he was
D05 0580  4    ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by
D05 0580 12    saying he asked for it. Yet, even after all these stratagems,
D05 0590 11    the conscience of Christian liberality is still not
D05 0600  7    laid to rest, any more than is the conscience of Harvard
D05 0610  5    University for having done the abject penance for its
D05 0620  3    rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School
D05 0630  1    Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.
D05 0630 10    In both cases the stubborn fact remains: liberalism
D05 0640  6    gave birth to two brilliant apostates, both legitimate
D05 0650  4    offspring of its loins, and when brought to the test,
D05 0660  4    it behaved shabbily. Suppose they both had ventured
D05 0660 12    into realms which their colleagues thought infidel:
D05 0670  7    is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences
D05 0680  4    of opinion? Is it after all possible that no matter
D05 0690  4    how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human
D05 0690 12    dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more
D05 0700 10    insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about?
D05 0710  7       However, there is a crucial difference between the
D05 0720  4    two histories. Emerson evaded the problem by shoving
D05 0730  3    it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked
D05 0740  1    out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick
D05 0740 11    the wound of his departure, preserve its self-respect
D05 0750  6    and eventually accord him pious veneration. Parker
D05 0760  3    insisted upon not resigning, even when the majority
D05 0770  1    wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to
D05 0770 10    throw him out. Hence he was in his lifetime, as is
D05 0780 10    the memory of him afterwards, a canker within the liberal
D05 0790  6    sensitivity. He still points an accusing finger at
D05 0800  3    all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to
D05 0800 14    support him nor the energy to cut his throat.
D05 0810  9       Actually, the dispute between Parker and the society
D05 0820  6    of his time, both ecclesiastical and social, was a
D05 0830  4    real one, a bitter one. It cannot be smoothed over
D05 0830 14    by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of
D05 0840  9    self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration
D05 0850  7    of the justice of the objections to him. The fact is
D05 0860  6    incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian Boston
D05 0870  2    was narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid
D05 0880  1    of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures
D05 0880 10    into iconoclasm, and quite prepared to resort to hysterical
D05 0890  8    repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened.
D05 0900  4    Parker, along with Garrison and Charles Sumner, showed
D05 0910  4    a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized
D05 0920  2    in defense of the Mexican War and slavery. Nevertheless,
D05 0930  1    we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry
D05 0930 10    of the populace; their passions were genuine, and the
D05 0940  7    division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut.
D05 0950  4    But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the
D05 0960  2    pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository
D05 0970  1    of liberality poses a different problem, which is not
D05 0970 10    to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of
D05 0980  8    freedom. Even though his theological theses have become,
D05 0990  4    to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation
D05 1000  1    he phrased is very much with us. It has been endlessly
D05 1000 12    rephrased, but I may here put it thus: at what point
D05 1010 11    do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant?
D05 1020  5    And then, as they become aware that they have reached
D05 1030  5    the end of their patience, what do they, to their dismay,
D05 1040  3    learn for the first time about themselves?
D05 1040 10       There can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could
D05 1050 11    be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior.
D05 1060  7    The gentle Channing, revered by all Bostonians, orthodox
D05 1070  5    or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville that
D05 1080  2    among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant
D05 1090  1    spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality
D05 1090  9    of judgment and action: "No city in the world is governed
D05 1100  9    so little by a police, and so much by mutual inspections
D05 1110  7    and what is called public sentiment. We stand more
D05 1120  4    in awe of one another than most people. Opinion is
D05 1130  1    less individual or runs more into masses, and often
D05 1130 10    rules with a rod of iron". Even more poignantly, and
D05 1140  7    with the insight of a genius, Channing added- remember,
D05 1150  4    this is Channing, not Parker!- that should a minister
D05 1160  7    in Boston trust himself to his heart, should he "speak
D05 1170  3    without book, and consequently break some law of speech,
D05 1180  1    or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should
D05 1180 10    find little mercy".
D05 1190  1       Channing wrote this- in a letter! I think it fair
D05 1190 11    to say that he never quite reached such candor in his
D05 1200 11    sermons. But Theodore Parker, commencing his mission
D05 1210  5    to the world-at-large, disguised as the minister of
D05 1220  5    a "twenty-eighth Congregational Church" which bore
D05 1230  2    no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended
D05 1230  9    from the founders (among which were still the Unitarian
D05 1240  8    churches), made explicit from the beginning that the
D05 1250  6    conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was
D05 1260  3    not something which could be evaporated into a genteel
D05 1270  1    difference about clerical decorum. Because he spoke
D05 1270  8    openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might-
D05 1280  6    with daring hyperbole- Parker vindicated Channing's
D05 1290  3    further prophecy that he who committed this infraction
D05 1300  3    of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals
D05 1310  1    were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared
D05 1310  9    to them libertines. An institutionalized liberalism
D05 1320  4    proved itself fundamentally an institution, and only
D05 1330  4    within those defined limits a license.
D05 1340  1       By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation,
D05 1340 10    we should, I am sure, come to a fresh realization,
D05 1350  9    however painful it be, that the battle between Parker
D05 1360  4    and his neighbors was fought in earnest. He arraigned
D05 1370  2    the citizens in language of so little courtesy that
D05 1370 11    they had to respond with, at the least, resentment.
D05 1380  8    What otherwise could "the lawyer, doctor, minister,
D05 1390  4    the men of science and letters" do when told that they
D05 1400  4    had "become the cherubim and seraphim and the three
D05 1410  1    archangels who stood before the golden throne of the
D05 1410 10    merchant, and continually cried, 'Holy, holy, holy
D05 1420  5    is the Almighty Dollar'"? Nor, when we recollect how
D05 1440  6    sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock
D05 1450  2    in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should
D05 1450 11    we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed
D05 1460  8    into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them
D05 1470  7    thus: "Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop
D05 1480  5    tells! reproach the Catholics for it! You and I do
D05 1490  4    the same thing. There are a great many bishops who
D05 1490 14    have never had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre
D05 1500 10    on their head, who appeal not to the authority of the
D05 1510  6    Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, a pope much
D05 1530  4    nearer home. Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists,
D05 1540  1    lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what
D05 1540 10    to say and the preachers what to think". This was war.
D05 1550  9    Parker meant business. And he took repeated care to
D05 1560  7    let his colleagues know that he intended them: "Even
D05 1570  3    the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria, and
D05 1580  2    are worse than those who deceived them"- which implied
D05 1580 11    that they were very bad indeed. It was "Duty" he said
D05 1590 10    that his parents had given him as a rule- beyond even
D05 1600  9    the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor
D05 1610  7    with which he was largely supplied- and it was duty
D05 1620  4    he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and
D05 1620 14    exhausted him by the age of fifty. Parker could weep-
D05 1630 10    and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest
D05 1640  6    provocation- but the psychology of those tears was
D05 1650  4    entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to
D05 1660  1    massacre his opponents. "If it gave me pleasure to
D05 1660 10    say hard things", he wrote, "I would shut up forever".
D05 1670  8    We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in
D05 1680  6    this vein, he believed what he said, because he could
D05 1690  3    continue, "But the TRUTH, which cost me bitter tears
D05 1700  2    to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter
D05 1700 13    than fire". Because he copiously shed his own tears,
D05 1710  9    and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the
D05 1720  8    impersonalized conscience of New England, he was not
D05 1730  4    disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's
D05 1740  1    consciences.
D05 1740  2       Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how
D05 1750  1    strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference
D05 1750 10    to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed
D05 1760  9    to be the central hope of its Christian survival, that
D05 1770  4    of the literal, factual historicity of the miracles
D05 1780  2    as reported in the Four Gospels. It is idle to ask
D05 1780 13    why we are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing
D05 1790  8    the deepest piety, decides anew that it is of no importance
D05 1800  7    whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine
D05 1810  4    at eleven A. M. on the third of August, A. D. 32. We
D05 1820  4    have no answer as to why we are not alarmed. So we
D05 1820 16    are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for
D05 1830 10    having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy,
D05 1840  6    to salute his courage, and to pass on, happily forgetting
D05 1850  4    both him and the entire episode. We have not the leisure,
D05 1860  3    or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was
D05 1860 13    working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate
D05 1870 11    from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the
D05 1880  7    audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor,
D05 1890  3    the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying that, while
D05 1900  3    he believed Jesus "like other religious teachers",
D05 1900 10    worked miracles, "I see not how a miracle proves a
D05 1910 10    doctrine".
