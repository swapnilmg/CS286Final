J03 0010  1       A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2. It consists
J03 0010 11    of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims.
J03 0020  8    There is a small well in the top in which the fluid
J03 0030  7    or paste to be tested is placed. A tape of cellulose
J03 0040  3    acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls
J03 0040 13    the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces
J03 0050 10    of the blocks. In normal use weights are hung on the
J03 0070  8    end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the
J03 0080  5    material to be tested between the blocks. After it
J03 0090  1    has reached terminal velocity, the time for the tape
J03 0090 10    to travel a known distance is recorded. By the use
J03 0100  7    of various weights, data for a force-rate of shear
J03 0110  3    graph can be obtained. The instrument used for this
J03 0120  1    work was a slight modification of that previously described.
J03 0120 10       In this test a **f tape was pulled between the blocks
J03 0130 11    with a motor and pulley at a rate of **f with a clearance
J03 0140 10    of 0.002'' on each side of the tape. This gives a rate
J03 0150  7    of shear of **f. This, however, can only be considered
J03 0160  1    approximate, as the diameter of the pulley was increased
J03 0160 10    by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally
J03 0170 10    removed from the pulley during the runs. The face of
J03 0180  7    one block contained a hole 1/16'' in diameter which
J03 0181  4    led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal
J03 0190  8    pressure.
J03 0190  9       Although there were only four fluids tested, it
J03 0200  8    was apparent that there were two distinct types. Two
J03 0210  5    of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure
J03 0220  1    when undergoing shear, and two showed small negative
J03 0220  9    pressures which were negligible in comparison with
J03 0230  7    the amount of the positive pressures generated by the
J03 0240  4    other two.
J03 0240  6       Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid, labeled
J03 0250  5    12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure.
J03 0260  2    Although the tape was run for over 1 hr., a steady
J03 0270  1    state was not reached, and it was concluded that the
J03 0270 11    reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer
J03 0280  8    was built up from the material fed from between the
J03 0290  5    blocks and this was available at a very slow rate.
J03 0300  2    A system had to be used which did not depend upon the
J03 0300 14    feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements
J03 0310  8    of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable
J03 0320  8    time. A back pressure was then introduced, and the
J03 0330  3    rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated
J03 0340  1    which was greater, the normal pressure in the block
J03 0340 10    or the back pressure. By this method it was determined
J03 0350  7    that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene
J03 0360  6    (molecular weight reported to be 770) was over half
J03 0370  3    an atmosphere. The actual pressure was not determined
J03 0370 11    because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of
J03 0380  9    the apparatus on hand.
J03 0390  1       The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures
J03 0390 10    were polybutenes with molecular weights which were
J03 0400  6    stated to be 520 and 300. These are fluids which one
J03 0410  6    would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian
J03 0420  2    because of their lower molecular weight. The maximum
J03 0420 10    suction was 3.25'' of test fluid measured from the
J03 0430  9    top of the block, and steady states were apparently
J03 0440  6    reached with these fluids. It is presumed that this
J03 0450  3    negative head was associated with some geometric factor
J03 0460  1    of the assembly, since different readings were obtained
J03 0460  9    with the same fluid and the only apparent difference
J03 0470  7    was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus.
J03 0480  4    This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity
J03 0490  2    head **f since this is not sufficient to explain the
J03 0490 12    readings by several magnitudes.
J03 0500  4       These experiments can be considered exploratory
J03 0510  2    only. However, they do demonstrate the presence of
J03 0510 10    large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear
J03 0520  9    fields which were forecast by the theory in the first
J03 0530  7    part of the paper. They also give information which
J03 0540  2    will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument
J03 0550  1    for the measurement of the normal pressures. Such an
J03 0550 10    instrument would be useful for the characterization
J03 0560  6    of many commercial materials as well as theoretical
J03 0570  3    studies. The elasticity as a parameter of fluids which
J03 0580  1    is not subject to simple measurement at present, and
J03 0580 10    it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown
J03 0590  8    manner with many commercial materials. Such an instrument
J03 0600  5    is expected to be especially useful if it could be
J03 0610  5    used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such
J03 0610 14    as printing inks, paints, adhesives, molten plastics,
J03 0620  7    and bread dough, for the elasticity is related to those
J03 0630  7    various properties termed "length", "shortness", "spinnability",
J03 0650  3    etc., which are usually judged by subjective methods
J03 0660  4    at present.
J03 0660  6       The actual change **f caused by a shear field is
J03 0670  7    calculated by multiplying the pressure differential
J03 0680  1    times the volume, just as it is for any gravitational
J03 0680 11    or osmotic pressure head. If the volume is the molal
J03 0690  9    volume, then **f is obtained on a molal basis which
J03 0700  6    is the customary terminology of the chemists.
J03 0710  1       Although the **f calculation is obvious by analogy
J03 0710  9    with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure,
J03 0720  7    it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can
J03 0730  7    be generalized to include related effects. Consider
J03 0740  2    a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional
J03 0750  1    area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of
J03 0750 12    h (referred to the same base as H) and a cross-sectional
J03 0760 12    area of a. If **f is the change per unit volume in
J03 0770 12    Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant
J03 0780  8    P and T, and |r is the density of the fluid, then
J03 0790  8    the total potential energy of the system above the
J03 0800  5    reference height is **f. **f is the work necessary
J03 0810  1    to fill the manometer column from the reference height
J03 0810 10    to h. The total volume of the system above the reference
J03 0820 10    height is **f, and h can be eliminated to obtain an
J03 0830  8    equation for the total potential energy of the system
J03 0840  5    in terms of H. The minimum total potential energy
J03 0850  2    is found by taking the derivative with respect to H
J03 0860  1    and equating to zero. This gives **f, which is the
J03 0860 11    pressure. This is interesting for it combines both
J03 0870  7    the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function
J03 0880  3    for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy
J03 0890  2    for equilibrium. This method can be extended to include
J03 0890 11    the concentration differences caused by shear fields.
J03 0900  7    The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs
J03 0910  6    function may also be developed in an analogous way.
J03 0920  3       In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics
J03 0930  1    of equilibrium (referred to by some as thermostatics)
J03 0930  9    to the steady state. This can be justified thermodynamically
J03 0940  9    in this case, and this will be done in a separate paper
J03 0950 10    which is being prepared. This has an interesting analogy
J03 0960  6    with the assumption stated by Philippoff that "the
J03 0970  3    deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied
J03 0980  2    to flowing solutions". There is one exception to the
J03 0980 11    above statement as has been pointed out, and that is
J03 0990 10    that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower
J03 1000  7    rates of shear, so the statement should be modified
J03 1010  3    by stating that the mechanics are similar. If the mechanics
J03 1020  1    are similar, we can also infer that the thermodynamics
J03 1020 10    will also be similar.
J03 1030  3       The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function
J03 1040  1    difference **f and exerting a force normal to the shearing
J03 1040 11    face is compatible with the information obtained from
J03 1050  7    optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing
J03 1060  4    shear. Essentially these birefringence studies show
J03 1070  2    that at low rates of shear a tension is present at
J03 1070 13    45` to the direction of shear, and as the rate of shear
J03 1080 11    increases, the direction of the maximum tension moves
J03 1090  6    asymptotically toward the direction of shear. According
J03 1100  4    to Philippoff, the recoverable shear s is given by
J03 1110  3    **f where |c is the angle of extinction. From this
J03 1110 13    and the force of deformation it should be possible
J03 1120  9    to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which
J03 1130  5    should be equal to the **f calculated from the pressure
J03 1140  3    normal to the shearing face.
J03 1140  8       There is another means which should show the direction
J03 1150  7    and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic
J03 1160  3    fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature,
J03 1170  1    and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low
J03 1170 12    viscosity fluids in shear fields. These droplets are
J03 1180  7    distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would
J03 1190  6    be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands. These
J03 1200  3    droplets appear to be ellipsoids, and it is mathematically
J03 1210  1    convenient to assume that they are. If they are not
J03 1210 11    ellipsoids, the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation.
J03 1220  8    The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is,
J03 1230  7    of course, given by the direction of the major axis
J03 1240  5    of the ellipsoids. Mason and Taylor both show that
J03 1250  1    the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates
J03 1250 13    of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear
J03 1260  8    with increased rates of shear. (Some suspensions break
J03 1270  4    up before they are near to the direction of shear,
J03 1280  3    and some become asymptotic to it without breakup.)
J03 1280 11    This is, of course, a similar type of behavior to that
J03 1290 10    indicated by birefringence studies. The relative forces
J03 1300  5    can be calculated from the various radii of curvature
J03 1310  4    if we assume: (A) The surface tension is uniform on
J03 1320  2    the surface of the drop. (B) That because of the low
J03 1320 13    viscosity of the fluid, the internal pressure is the
J03 1330  9    same in all directions. (C) The kinetic effects are
J03 1340  6    negligible. (D) Since the shape of the drop conforms
J03 1350  6    to the force field, it does not appreciably affect
J03 1360  2    the distribution of forces in the fluid.
J03 1360  9       These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity
J03 1370  5    fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are
J03 1380  4    subjected to low rates of shear. Just as the pressure
J03 1390  1    exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is **f
J03 1390 11    and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical
J03 1400  8    shape is **f, the pressure exerted by any curved surface
J03 1410  7    is **f, where |g is the interfacial tension and **f
J03 1420  4    and **f are the two radii of curvature. This formula
J03 1430  2    is given by Rumscheidt and Mason. If a is the major
J03 1440  1    axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two
J03 1440 13    axes, the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the
J03 1450 11    end of the axis is **f, and the difference in pressure
J03 1460  8    along the a and b axes is **f.
J03 1470  4       There are no data published in the literature on
J03 1480  1    the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above
J03 1480 11    formulas. However, there are photographs of suspended
J03 1490  6    drops of cyclohexanol phthalate (viscosity 155 poises)
J03 1500  4    suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by
J03 1510  2    Mason and Bartok. This viscosity of the material in
J03 1510 11    the drops is, of course, not negligible. Measurements
J03 1520  7    on the photograph in this paper give **f at the maximum
J03 1530  7    rate of shear of **f. If it is assumed that the formula
J03 1540  4    given by Lodge of **f, cosec 2|c applies, the pressure
J03 1550  2    difference along the major axes can be calculated from
J03 1550 11    the angle of inclination of the major axis, and from
J03 1560  9    this the interfacial tension can be calculated. Its
J03 1570  5    value was **f from the above data. This appears to
J03 1580  3    be high, as would be expected from the appreciable
J03 1580 12    viscosity of the material in the drops.
J03 1590  7       It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic
J03 1600  4    properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like
J03 1610  4    deformation. The internal energy of an ideal gas depends
J03 1620  3    on temperature only and is independent of pressure
J03 1620 11    or volume. In other words, if an ideal gas is compressed
J03 1630 10    and kept at constant temperature, the work done in
J03 1640  6    compressing it is completely converted into heat and
J03 1650  4    transferred to the surrounding heat sink. This means
J03 1650 12    that work equals q which in turn equals **f.
J03 1660  9       There is a well-known relationship between probability
J03 1670  6    and entropy which states that **f, where \q is the
J03 1680  6    probability that state (i.e., volume for an ideal gas)
J03 1690  5    could be reached by chance alone. this is known as
J03 1700  1    conformational entropy. This conformational entropy
J03 1700  6    is, in this case, equal to the usual entropy, for there
J03 1710  8    are no other changes or other energies involved. Note
J03 1720  4    that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional
J03 1730  2    energy, the compressed gas does exert an increased
J03 1730 10    pressure. The energy for any isothermal work done by
J03 1740  9    the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its
J03 1750  6    surroundings.
