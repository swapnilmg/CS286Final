B11 0010  1       California Democrats this weekend will take the
B11 0010  8    wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which
B11 0020  6    they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district
B11 0030  5    headquarters, party clubrooms and workers' backyards.
B11 0040  2       They seem darned proud of it.
B11 0040  8       And they're confident that the GOP, currently assailed
B11 0050  7    by dissensions within the ranks, will be impressed
B11 0060  7    by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled
B11 0070  5    machine.
B11 0070  6    #@#
B11 0070  7    Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled
B11 0080  5    as a conference of the California Democratic Council
B11 0090  3    directorate. But it will include 200-odd officeholders,
B11 0100  1    organization leaders and "interested party people".
B11 0110  1       Out of this session may come:
B11 0110  7    _1_
B11 0110  8       - Plans for a dramatic, broad-scale party rally
B11 0120  5    in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer
B11 0130  3    Democrats from all over the country.
B11 0130  9    _2_
B11 0130 10       - Blueprints for doubling the CDC's present 55,000
B11 0140  7    enrollment.
B11 0150  1    _3_
B11 0150  3       - Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing
B11 0150 10    convention in Fresno next Jan. 26-28.
B11 0160  6    _4_
B11 0160  7       - And proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking
B11 0170  5    conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts.
B11 0180  2       At the head of the CDC is an unorthodox, 39-year-old
B11 0190  4    amateur politico, Thomas B. Carvey Jr., whose normal
B11 0200  3    profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon
B11 0210  1    missiles. He's approached his Democratic duties in
B11 0210  8    hard-nosed engineering fashion.
B11 0220  2    #@#
B11 0220  3    Viewed from afar, the CDC looks like a rather stalwart
B11 0230  4    political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out
B11 0240  1    into an array of district leaders and standing committees,
B11 0240 10    and thence into its component clubs and affiliated
B11 0250  7    groups- 500 or so.
B11 0260  1       Much of its strength stems from the comfortable
B11 0260  8    knowledge that every "volunteer" Democratic organization
B11 0270  4    of any consequence belongs to the CDC.
B11 0280  3    #@#
B11 0280  4    Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy, from
B11 0290  2    Gov. Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates
B11 0300  1    in this huge operation.
B11 0300  5       Contrarily, Republican "volunteers" go their separate
B11 0310  4    ways, and thus far have given no indication that they'd
B11 0320  3    be willing to join forces under a single directorate,
B11 0330  1    except in the most loose-knit fashion.
B11 0330  8       Carvey believes that reapportionment, which left
B11 0350  3    many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries,
B11 0360  2    actually will increase CDC membership. Where only
B11 0370  2    one club existed before, he says, two will flourish
B11 0370 11    henceforth.
B11 0380  1       Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting
B11 0380  8    up CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory.
B11 0390  7    Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that
B11 0400  6    register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's favor, strongest
B11 0410  3    where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly
B11 0420  1    even basis.
B11 0420  3       Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts
B11 0430  1    1962 will be a tremendously "partisan year". Hence
B11 0430  9    the attention they're lavishing on the CDC.
B11 0440  6       In all probability, the council will screen and
B11 0450  5    endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress,
B11 0460  2    and then strive to put its full weight behind these
B11 0460 12    pre-primary favorites. This bodes heated contests in
B11 0470  7    several districts where claims have already been staked
B11 0480  6    out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye-to-eye
B11 0490  5    with the CDC.
B11 0490  8       Naturally, the statewide races will provide the
B11 0500  5    major test for the expanding council.
B11 0510  1       Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John
B11 0510  8    F. Kennedy last year, who relegated it to a somewhat
B11 0520  8    subordinate role in the Presidential campaign, the
B11 0530  3    CDC plainly intends to provide the party's campaign
B11 0540  2    muscle in 1962. There is evidence that it will be happily
B11 0540 13    received by Gov. Brown and the other constitutional
B11 0550  8    incumbents.
B11 0550  9    #@#
B11 0560  1    Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would
B11 0560  9    be Brown's most formidable foe, with ex-Gov. Knight
B11 0570  8    a close second. But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial
B11 0580  8    aspirants don't worry him very much.
B11 0590  4       In his CDC work, Carvey has the close-in support
B11 0600  2    and advice of one of California's shrewdest political
B11 0600 10    strategists: former Democratic National Committeeman
B11 0610  5    Paul Ziffren, who backed him over a Northland candidate
B11 0620  8    espoused by Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk. (Significantly,
B11 0630  4    bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk
B11 0640  4    moving into the national committee post over Ziffren
B11 0650  1    are still audible in party circles.)
B11 0650  7    #@#
B11 0650  8    NOTE: We've just received an announcement of the 54th
B11 0660  8    Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention
B11 0670  3    Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg.,
B11 0680  5    which graphically illustrates the CDC's broad appeal.
B11 0690  4    State Sen. Dick Richards will keynote; state and county
B11 0710  1    committeemen, CDC directors and representatives, members
B11 0720  2    of 16 area clubs, and "all residents" have been invited.
B11 0740  1       This is going to be a language lesson, and you can
B11 0740 12    master it in a few minutes. It is a short course in
B11 0750 10    Communese.
B11 0750 11       It works with English, Russian, German, Hungarian
B11 0760  6    or almost any other foreign tongue. Once you learn
B11 0770  5    how to translate Communese, much of each day's deluge
B11 0780  3    of news will become clearer. At least, I have found
B11 0780 13    it so.
B11 0790  2    #@#
B11 0790  3    For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated
B11 0800  1    Dr. Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost
B11 0800 10    invariably impute to others the very motives which
B11 0810  8    they harbor themselves. They accuse their enemies of
B11 0820  5    precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most
B11 0830  3    guilty.
B11 0830  4       President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist
B11 0840  2    world that the United States will build up its military
B11 0850  1    strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere
B11 0850 10    was somewhat surprisingly, reported in full text or
B11 0860  6    fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain. Then
B11 0870  4    the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces
B11 0890  1    with striking consistency.
B11 0890  4       Now listen closely:
B11 0900  1       Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English
B11 0900  8    to England:
B11 0910  1    #@#
B11 0910  2    "President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet
B11 0910  9    proposals, to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a
B11 0920 10    threat, as part of the world menace allegedly looming
B11 0930  6    over the countries of capitalism. Evidently the war
B11 0940  3    drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred
B11 0960  1    up in the West have been planned long in advance. The
B11 0960 12    West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially
B11 0970  7    because it is needed by the United States to justify
B11 0980  5    its arms drive".
B11 0980  8       The Soviet news agency TASS datelined from New
B11 0990  6    York in English to Europe:
B11 1000  1       "President Kennedy's enlargement of the American
B11 1000  7    military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus
B11 1010 10    to the American munitions industry. When the stock
B11 1020  6    exchange opened this morning, many dealers were quick
B11 1030  5    to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and United
B11 1040  2    Aircraft and prices rose substantially. Over 4 million
B11 1040 10    shares were sold, the highest figures since early June.
B11 1050  9    (Quotations follow".)
B11 1060  1       TASS datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe:
B11 1070  1       "Former Vice President Nixon came out in support
B11 1070  9    of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the
B11 1080  8    arms race. He also demanded that Kennedy take additional
B11 1090  6    measures to increase international tension: specifically
B11 1100  3    to crush the Cuban revolution, resume nuclear testing,
B11 1110  3    resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful
B11 1120  1    seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military
B11 1120 10    programs at home".
B11 1130  2       TASS from Moscow in English to Europe:
B11 1140  1       "The American press clamored for many days promising
B11 1140  9    President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic
B11 1150  9    and foreign problems confronting the United States.
B11 1160  5    In fact, the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling,
B11 1170  4    the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors
B11 1180  2    of the current President. If there were no West Berlin
B11 1190  1    problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an
B11 1190  8    excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to
B11 1200  8    solve the internal and external problems besetting
B11 1210  2    the United States and its NATO partners. Washington
B11 1220  1    apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting
B11 1220 10    large military appropriations to speed the slow revival
B11 1230  8    of the U.S. economy after a prolonged slump".
B11 1240  5    #@#
B11 1240  6    And now, for Communist listeners and readers:
B11 1250  4       Moscow Radio in Russian to the USSR:
B11 1260  1       "The U.S. President has shown once again that the
B11 1270  2    United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin
B11 1270 11    crisis to justify the armaments race. As was to be
B11 1280 10    expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm
B11 1290  6    by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn, where officials
B11 1300  3    of the West German government praised it".
B11 1310  1       Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London:
B11 1320  1       "U.S. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria
B11 1320  9    over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee.
B11 1330  8    British common sense is proverbial. The present attempts
B11 1340  5    of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons
B11 1350  3    shows that this British common sense is unwilling to
B11 1360  1    pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new
B11 1360 11    military adventures".
B11 1370  1    #@#
B11 1370  2    East Berlin (Communist) radio in German to Germany:
B11 1380  1       "A better position for negotiations is the real
B11 1380  9    point of this speech. Kennedy knows the West will not
B11 1390 10    wage war for West Berlin, neither conventional nor
B11 1400  5    nuclear, and negotiations will come as certainly as
B11 1410  4    the peace treaty. Whenever some Washington circles
B11 1420  1    were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they
B11 1420 10    have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique
B11 1430  8    in the Pentagon and in Bonn. In Kennedy's speech are
B11 1440  5    cross currents, sensible ones and senseless ones, reflecting
B11 1450  3    the great struggle of opinions between the President's
B11 1460  1    advisers and the political and economic forces behind
B11 1460  9    them. Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting,
B11 1470  8    there will be no war over West Berlin".
B11 1480  4       Moscow TASS in Russian datelined Sochi:
B11 1490  2       "Chairman Khrushchev received the U.S. President's
B11 1500  1    disarmament adviser, John McCloy. Their conversation
B11 1510  1    and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere".
B11 1510 10       Now, to translate from the Communese, this means:
B11 1520  8       The "West Berlin" crisis is really an East Berlin
B11 1530  7    crisis.
B11 1530  8    #@#
B11 1530  9    The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin
B11 1540  8    (Wall Street) and the Red Army (Pentagon) egged on
B11 1550  6    by the West Germans (East Germans).
B11 1560  1       The reason was to speed up domestic production in
B11 1560 10    the USSR, which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing
B11 1570  6    power, and try to end the permanent recession in Russian
B11 1580  6    living standards.
B11 1580  8       Chairman Khrushchev (Kennedy) rattles his rockets
B11 1590  6    (sabre) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen
B11 1600  7    his negotiating position. His advisers in the Politburo
B11 1610  4    (White House) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions,
B11 1620  3    so he is not always consistent.
B11 1620  9       The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional
B11 1630  6    nor a nuclear war over Berlin, and neither will its
B11 1640  5    Warsaw Pact allies. The West has no intention of attacking
B11 1650  3    Russia.
B11 1650  4       Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy had a terrible
B11 1660  4    row at Sochi.
B11 1660  7       See, Communese is easy- once you get onto it.
B11 1680  1       Aug. 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin
B11 1680 10    founded the Pennsylvania Gazette- a century during
B11 1690  7    which it had undergone several changes in ownership
B11 1700  5    and a few brief suspensions in publication- this paper
B11 1710  5    made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post.
B11 1720  2    The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C.
B11 1720 12    Atkinson and Charles Alexander, who had just taken
B11 1730  8    over Franklin's old paper, desired a more distinctive
B11 1740  7    name.
B11 1740  8       When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly
B11 1750  6    family newspaper and under its new name its format
B11 1760  3    remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually
B11 1770  1    contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary
B11 1770  9    essays. In the middle of the century, with a circulation
B11 1780  8    of 90,000, the Post was one of the most popular weeklies
B11 1790  6    in the country. But during the second half of the century
B11 1800  4    its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus
B11 1810  1    H. K. Curtis purchased it- "paper, type, and all"-
B11 1820  3    for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned
B11 1820 14    fiction and initialed miscellany, and with only some
B11 1830  7    2,000 subscribers.
B11 1840  1       Little more than a fine old name, valuable principally
B11 1840  9    because of the Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening
B11 1850  6    Post was slow to revive. But Curtis poured over $1
B11 1860  6    million into it and in time it again became one of
B11 1870  3    the most popular weeklies of the country.
B11 1880  1       "Remember the French railroad baron who was going
B11 1880  9    to take me floating down the Nile"? ... "Remember the
B11 1890  8    night Will Rogers filled a tooth for me between numbers"?
B11 1900  8    ... "Sure, we met a barrel of rich men but it's hard
B11 1910  8    to find the real thing when you're young, beautiful
B11 1920  3    and the toast of two continents" ... "Remember Fanny
B11 1930  2    Brice promised my mother she would look after me on
B11 1930 12    the road"?
B11 1940  1       All this remembering took place the other night
B11 1940  9    when I had supper with the Ziegfeld Girls at the Beverly
B11 1950 10    Hills Club.
B11 1960  1       A quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy
B11 1960 12    of walking dreams sashayed up and down the staircases
B11 1970  7    of the old New Amsterdam Theater, N.Y. But watching
B11 1980  4    Mrs. Cyril Ring, Berniece Dalton Janssen, Mrs. Robert
B11 1990  4    Jarvis, Mrs. Walter Adams order low-calory seafood,
B11 2000  2    no bread, I could see the Ziegfeld Girls of 1920 were
B11 2010  2    determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.
B11 2010  9       I was anxious to hear about those dazzling days
B11 2020  8    on the Great White Way. All I could remember was Billie
B11 2030  6    Dove pasted over the ceiling of my big brother's room.
B11 2040  4       "Billie was really beautiful"! exclaimed Vera Forbes
B11 2050  3    Adams, batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed
B11 2060  1    glasses.
