J40 0010  1       IN assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961,
J40 0010 10    the question, as always, is the prospect for general
J40 0020  9    business activity. By and large, what happens to business
J40 0040  7    as a whole will govern the relationship between demand
J40 0050  3    and supply conditions in the capital markets and will
J40 0060  2    thus determine interest rates. Moreover, the trend
J40 0060  9    of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive
J40 0070  8    influence on fiscal, monetary, and other Federal policies
J40 0080  5    which affect interest rates.
J40 0090  1       Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts
J40 0090 10    of general business activity. During much of the year
J40 0100  7    the general level of business activity has moved along
J40 0110  5    on a record-high plateau, but there have been persistent
J40 0120  2    signs of slack in the economy. The tendency for general
J40 0130  1    business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more
J40 0130  9    evident.
J40 0140  1       Although the pause in the advance of general business
J40 0140 10    activity this year has thus far been quite modest,
J40 0150  7    it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening
J40 0160  4    process will continue into the first quarter of 1961
J40 0170  1    and possibly somewhat longer. It is difficult to see
J40 0170 10    any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at
J40 0180  8    this time which would give the economy a new upward
J40 0190  5    thrust. The rate of plant and equipment spending by
J40 0200  2    business and industry now seems to be topping out and
J40 0200 12    facing some decline. In earlier business cycles, when
J40 0210  7    this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp
J40 0220  4    upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing
J40 0230  2    became easier to obtain. At this time, however, there
J40 0230 11    are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit
J40 0240  8    will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp
J40 0250  8    rise in residential construction. These signs are the
J40 0260  5    inventories of unsold houses in some areas of the country
J40 0270  3    and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments
J40 0270 12    (7.6% in September). On the other hand, in a more favorable
J40 0280 11    vein, general business activity should receive some
J40 0290  6    stimulus from rising Federal spending, and the reduction
J40 0300  5    in business inventories has probably run a good part
J40 0310  5    of its course. The 2% increase in retail sales in October
J40 0320  1    to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection
J40 0320 11    as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National
J40 0330 10    Industrial Conference Board, which shows a decided
J40 0340  6    pickup in consumer spending plans.
J40 0350  1       The pattern of general business activity which probably
J40 0350  9    lies ahead of us is a further moderate softening through
J40 0360 10    the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity
J40 0370  8    gets under way. The recovery will probably be sparked
J40 0380  5    by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response
J40 0390  3    to more readily available mortgage credit, as well
J40 0390 11    as by an expansion of Government spending, well sustained
J40 0400  8    consumer spending, and some rebuilding of business
J40 0410  6    inventories.
J40 0410  7    #SLIGHT DOWNWARD PRESSURE#
J40 0420  1    What does the general business outlook suggest about
J40 0420  9    the trend of long-term rates in 1961? It suggests that
J40 0430 10    during the next several months, through the spring
J40 0440  5    of 1961, the demand for long-term capital funds may
J40 0450  3    be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend
J40 0450 12    to move a little lower, especially the rates on Federal,
J40 0460 10    state, and local bonds, as well as those on publicly
J40 0470  8    offered corporate bonds. However, as witnessed by the
J40 0480  5    large corporate bond calendar at present, as well as
J40 0490  2    the record amount of municipal bond issues approved
J40 0490 10    by voters, the over-all demands for capital funds seem
J40 0500  8    likely to remain high, so that any downward pressure
J40 0510  4    on rates from reduced demand should not be great. It
J40 0520  2    seems likely, moreover, that with an increase in the
J40 0530  8    rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions, interest
J40 0540  7    rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower
J40 0550  6    through the spring of next year, although the increased
J40 0560  3    ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily
J40 0570  1    in other terms than interest rate, e.g., easier downpayment
J40 0580  1    and amortization terms.
J40 0580  4       If the trend of general business activity follows
J40 0590  2    the pattern suggested here, we are likely to see additional
J40 0600  1    steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the
J40 0600 10    availability of credit. Certainly a further reduction
J40 0610  7    in the discount rate would be a strong possibility,
J40 0620  5    as well as an easier reserve position for the banking
J40 0630  2    system. However, the monetary authorities will continue
J40 0630  9    to be required to pay attention to the consequences
J40 0640  9    of their actions with respect to our international
J40 0650  5    balance of payments position and the outflow of gold,
J40 0660  3    as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of
J40 0660 13    excessive liquidity in the economy, which would delay
J40 0670  8    the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the
J40 0680  6    next expansion phase of the business cycle.
J40 0690  1    #OPEN MARKET POLICY#
J40 0690  4    One of the most intriguing questions is whether the
J40 0700  3    recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities
J40 0700 10    from confining their open market operations to Treasury
J40 0710  8    bills will spread into longer-term Government securities
J40 0720  6    in the next few months. To the extent that the new
J40 0730  6    Administration has its wishes, the Federal Reserve
J40 0740  2    would conduct its open market operations throughout
J40 0740  9    the entire maturity range of Government securities
J40 0750  6    and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest
J40 0760  5    rates. The principle of "bills only", or "bills preferably",
J40 0770  4    seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that
J40 0780  3    it is difficult to envision conditions which would
J40 0780 11    persuade the authorities to depart radically from it
J40 0790  8    by extending their open market purchases regularly
J40 0800  4    into long-term Government securities. However, to the
J40 0810  4    extent that the monetary authorities, in their effort
J40 0820  1    to ease credit in the next several months, conduct
J40 0820 10    their open market operations in longer-term Government
J40 0830  6    bonds, they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency
J40 0840  4    for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of
J40 0850  2    market forces.
J40 0850  4       By the end of the spring of 1961, assuming that
J40 0860  2    a general business recovery gets under way, interest
J40 0860 10    rates should begin to edge upward again, depending
J40 0870  7    upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination
J40 0880  4    with which the monetary authorities move to restrain
J40 0890  2    credit availability. My guess would be that interest
J40 0890 10    rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961
J40 0900  8    and during the second half of the year will turn up
J40 0910  7    gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn.
J40 0920  3       It is pertinent to ask the question: Has the long
J40 0930  2    upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years
J40 0930 11    just about run its course, and are we now entering
J40 0940  9    a period in which both capital market forces and Federal
J40 0950  5    policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest
J40 0960  3    rates? My answer is in the negative because I believe
J40 0970  1    that total capital demands during the Sixties will
J40 0970  9    continue to press against available supplies, and interest
J40 0980  6    rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels.
J40 0990  6    #FIVE BASIC FORCES#
J40 0990  9    This view is based upon several basic economic forces
J40 1000  5    which I believe will be operating in the Sixties, as
J40 1010  4    follows:
J40 1010  5    _(1)_
J40 1010  6       Recent events in the General Assembly of the United
J40 1020  5    Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with
J40 1030  2    us, and probably intensify, for the foreseeable future.
J40 1030 10    This makes it certain that Federal expenditures for
J40 1040  7    military preparedness and foreign economic aid are
J40 1050  5    likely to rise further in the next several years. We
J40 1060  3    are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain
J40 1060 14    the friendship of the new African nations against the
J40 1070  9    ruthless competition of the Communist bloc. Our efforts
J40 1080  7    to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound
J40 1090  6    to mean accelerated Federal spending. Moreover, it
J40 1100  2    is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating
J40 1100 10    a faster rate of economic growth of the country, to
J40 1110  9    keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate
J40 1120  5    that our free economic system is better than theirs,
J40 1130  3    will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas
J40 1140  1    such as education, housing, medical aid, and the like.
J40 1140 10    There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward
J40 1150  8    rising Federal expenditures, of which I take a dim
J40 1160  7    view, but it seems very likely to occur.
J40 1170  1    _(2)_
J40 1170  2       During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant
J40 1170 12    stepping up in the rate of household formations, which
J40 1180  9    should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures
J40 1190  8    and home building. According to the latest projections
J40 1210  2    of the Bureau of the Census, the annual rate of household
J40 1220  4    formations will increase for the next 20 years. Under
J40 1230  1    the most favorable assumptions for increase, the Bureau
J40 1230  9    of the Census projects that the annual rate of household
J40 1240  9    formations will rise from about 883,000 in the last
J40 1250  7    two years of the Fifties to an annual rate of about
J40 1260  4    1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties, and
J40 1270  1    to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the
J40 1270 11    second half of the decade. During the Seventies the
J40 1280  6    projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual
J40 1290  5    rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade.
J40 1300  1    Accordingly, the expanding markets for consumer goods
J40 1300  8    and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household
J40 1310  8    formation should enhance the general economic prospects
J40 1320  4    of the Sixties. However, the impact of a rising rate
J40 1330  4    of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated.
J40 1340  1    The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second
J40 1340 10    half of the Sixties is still considerably below the
J40 1350  7    annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three-year period from
J40 1360  6    April 1947 to March 1950.
J40 1360 11    _(3)_
J40 1360 12       With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties,
J40 1370  9    a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state
J40 1380  6    and local government units seems to be indicated. This
J40 1390  5    is an area in which there is still a large backlog
J40 1400  1    of demand. State and local expenditures (in real terms)
J40 1400 10    increased persistently from $26.5-billion in 1949 to
J40 1410  8    $44.3-billion in 1959, and it would not be surprising
J40 1420  6    if they showed a comparable increase in this decade,
J40 1430  2    which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion
J40 1440  1    by 1970. Here would be a powerful force for raising
J40 1440 11    business activity.
J40 1450  1    _(4)_
J40 1450  2       It seems likely that with the three preceding forces
J40 1450 11    at play, the rate of business and industrial plant
J40 1460  8    and equipment expenditures should continue to move
J40 1480  5    upward from the levels of the Fifties. Spurred by keen
J40 1490  3    competition in our industrial system, and still further
J40 1500  1    increases in the funds devoted to industrial research,
J40 1500  9    plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry
J40 1510  6    should rise during the decade.
J40 1520  1    _(5)_
J40 1520  2       In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook,
J40 1530  1    I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer
J40 1530 10    goods and housing which was dammed-up during the Thirties
J40 1540  8    and World War II is finally in the process of running
J40 1550  6    dry. There is some clear-cut evidence of this. For
J40 1560  4    example, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans
J40 1570  1    for housing under the VA home loan guaranty program
J40 1570 10    seems to have largely exhausted itself. Indeed, the
J40 1580  6    failure of home-building as a whole to respond this
J40 1590  5    year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing,
J40 1600  2    and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes
J40 1600 11    and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings, may
J40 1610  8    also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog
J40 1620  8    demand for housing are reaching an end. In a way, we
J40 1630  6    may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles
J40 1640  1    today as the public no longer is willing to purchase
J40 1640 11    any car coming on the market but is more insistent
J40 1650  9    on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted
J40 1660  6    in the Fifties. The huge backlog of demand which was
J40 1670  3    evident in the first decade and a half after the War
J40 1680  1    was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public
J40 1680 10    during the War, and even more so by the easier and
J40 1690  8    easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields.
J40 1700  4    The consuming public has used up a good part of these
J40 1710  1    liquid assets, or they have been drained by the rising
J40 1710 11    price level, and we have apparently gotten to the end
J40 1720  9    of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms
J40 1730  5    easier. This is not to say that the level of consumer
J40 1740  3    expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties.
J40 1740 12    I am confident that it will, but consumer spending
J40 1750  9    in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog
J40 1760  8    of wants and desires which characterized most of the
J40 1770  4    Fifties. Markets should become more competitive as
J40 1780  2    consumers become more selective.
J40 1780  6    #SIXTIES' CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS#
J40 1790  1    Accordingly, during the Sixties our national economy
J40 1790  8    is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties
J40 1800 12    and, in the process, to require enormous amounts of
J40 1810  5    capital funds.
