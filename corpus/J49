J49 0010  1       The next question is whether board members favor
J49 0010  9    their own social classes in their roles as educational
J49 0020  7    policy-makers. On the whole, it appears that they do
J49 0030  6    not favor their own social classes in an explicit way.
J49 0040  2    Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be
J49 0040 13    clearly drawn. A hypothetical issue of this sort might
J49 0050  9    deal with the establishment of a free public junior
J49 0060  6    college in a community where there already was a good
J49 0070  4    private college which served the middle-class youth
J49 0070 12    adequately but was too expensive for working-class
J49 0080  8    youth. In situations of this sort the board generally
J49 0090  7    favors the expansion of free education. Campbell studied
J49 0100  3    the records of 172 school board members in twelve western
J49 0110  2    cities over the period of 1931-40 and found "little
J49 0110 12    or no relationship between certain social and economic
J49 0120  7    factors and school board competence", as judged by
J49 0130  6    a panel of professional educators who studied the voting
J49 0140  4    records on educational issues.
J49 0140  8       The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class
J49 0150  7    lines are as likely as not to involve representatives
J49 0160  4    of the working class on the school board who favor
J49 0170  2    some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather
J49 0170 11    than pay increases for teachers, and such issues are
J49 0180  8    not issues of educational policy.
J49 0190  2       In general, it appears that trustees and board members
J49 0200  1    attempt to represent the public interest in their administration
J49 0200 10    of educational policy, and this is made easier by the
J49 0210 10    fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class
J49 0220  8    values, which are generally thought to be valid for
J49 0230  5    the entire society. There have been very few cases
J49 0240  1    of explicit conflict of interest between the middle
J49 0240  9    class and any other class in the field of educational
J49 0250  8    policy. If there were more such cases, it would be
J49 0260  5    easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers
J49 0270  1    favor their own social classes.
J49 0270  6       There is currently a major controversy of public
J49 0280  4    education in which group interests and values are heavily
J49 0290  3    engaged. This is the issue of segregated schools in
J49 0290 12    the South. In this case it is primarily a matter of
J49 0300 11    conflict of racial groups rather than social-class
J49 0310  6    groups. Thus, the white middle and lower classes are
J49 0320  4    arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes.
J49 0330  1    This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit
J49 0330 12    white middle-class people better than it suits white
J49 0340  7    lower-class people. If this happens, there may be some
J49 0350  5    class conflict in the South, with school boards and
J49 0360  2    school teachers taking the middle-class position.
J49 0360  9    #THE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSION#
J49 0370  2    The members of the educational profession have a major
J49 0380  3    voice in the determination of educational policy, their
J49 0380 11    position being strongest in the universities. They
J49 0390  7    are mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people,
J49 0400  6    with a few in the upper class. Do they make class-biased
J49 0410  4    decisions?
J49 0410  5       In a society dominated by middle-class values and
J49 0420  3    working in an institution which transmits and strengthens
J49 0430  1    these social values, it is clear that the educational
J49 0430 10    profession must work for the values which are characteristic
J49 0440  9    of the society. There is no problem here. The problem
J49 0450  8    arises, if it does arise, when the educator has to
J49 0460  5    make a choice or a decision within the area of his
J49 0470  1    professional competence, but which bears some relation
J49 0470  8    to the social structure. For instance, in giving school
J49 0480  7    grades or in making recommendations for the award of
J49 0490  5    a college scholarship, does he consciously or unconsciously
J49 0500  3    favor students of one or another social class? Again,
J49 0510  1    in deciding on the content and method of his teaching,
J49 0510 11    does he favor a curriculum which will make his students
J49 0520  8    stronger competitors in the race for higher economic
J49 0530  5    status, or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens
J49 0540  2    students in other ways?
J49 0540  6       The answers to questions such as these certainly
J49 0550  5    depend to some extent upon the educator's own social-class
J49 0560  4    position and also upon his social history, as well
J49 0560 13    as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission
J49 0570 10    to be as an educator. In a set of case studies of teachers
J49 0580  9    with various social-class backgrounds, Wattenberg illustrates
J49 0590  4    a variety of approaches to students and to teaching
J49 0600  4    which depend upon the teacher's personality as well
J49 0610  2    as on his social-class background. One upward-mobile
J49 0610 11    teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils
J49 0620  9    because she wants them to develop the attitudes and
J49 0630  5    skills that will enable them to climb, while another
J49 0640  2    upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person
J49 0640 11    with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages
J49 0650  9    and deprivations at home, and he hopes to encourage
J49 0660  8    them by friendly treatment.
J49 0670  1       One social-class factor which plays a large part
J49 0670 10    in educational policy today is the fact that a great
J49 0680  8    many school and college teachers are upward mobile
J49 0690  3    from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families.
J49 0700  1    Their own experience in the social system influences
J49 0700  9    their work and attitudes as teachers. While this influence
J49 0710  7    is a complex matter, depending upon personality factors
J49 0720  4    in the individual as well as upon his social-class
J49 0730  3    experience, there probably are some general statements
J49 0730 10    about social-class background and educational policy
J49 0740  7    that can be made with a fair degree of truth.
J49 0750  6       Teachers who have been upward mobile probably see
J49 0760  3    education as most valuable for their students if it
J49 0760 12    serves students as it has served them; that is, they
J49 0770 10    are likely to favor a kind of education that has
J49 0780  7    vocational-advancement
J49 0780  9    value. This does not necessarily mean that such teachers
J49 0800  5    will favor vocational education, as contrasted with
J49 0810  4    liberal education, but they are likely to favor an
J49 0820  2    approach to liberal education which has a maximal
J49 0820 10    vocational-advancement
J49 0830  1    value, as against a kind of "pure" liberal education
J49 0830 10    that is not designed to help people get better jobs.
J49 0840 10       There is no doubt that higher education since World
J49 0850  6    War II has moved away from "pure" liberal education
J49 0860  4    toward greater emphasis on technology and specialization.
J49 0870  2    There are several causes for this, one being rapid
J49 0870 11    economic development with increasing numbers of middle-class
J49 0880  8    positions requiring engineering or scientific training.
J49 0890  6    But another cause may lie in the experience of so many
J49 0900  8    new postwar faculty members with their own use of education
J49 0910  5    as a means of social advancement.
J49 0910 11       Compared with the college and university faculty
J49 0920  7    members of the period from 1900 to 1930, the new postwar
J49 0930  7    faculty members consist of more children of immigrants
J49 0931  3    and more children of urban working-class fathers. Their
J49 0940  7    experience is quite in contrast with that of children
J49 0950  5    of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents,
J49 0960  2    who are more likely to regard education as good for
J49 0960 12    its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases
J49 0970  8    in the curriculum.
J49 0970 11    #THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" GROUPS#
J49 0980  4    Educational policies are formed by several groups who
J49 0990  4    are officially or unofficially appointed to act in
J49 1000  1    the public interest. Legislators are one such group,
J49 1000  9    and state legislators have major responsibility for
J49 1010  5    educational legislation. They generally vote so as
J49 1020  4    to serve their own constituency, and if the constituency
J49 1030  1    should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class,
J49 1030 10    they might be expected to vote and work for middle-
J49 1040 10    or for lower-class interests in education. However,
J49 1050  4    there are relatively few such political constituencies,
J49 1060  1    and, as has been pointed out, there is seldom a clear-cut
J49 1060 13    distinction between the educational interests of one
J49 1070  7    social class and those of another.
J49 1080  3       Another public interest group is the commission
J49 1090  1    of laymen or educators which is appointed to study
J49 1090 10    an educational problem and to make recommendations.
J49 1100  5    Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent
J49 1110  4    the interest of the entire society, as they conceive
J49 1120  1    it. Nevertheless, their conclusions and recommendations
J49 1120  7    cannot please everybody, and they often represent a
J49 1130  8    particular economic or political point of view. For
J49 1140  5    instance, there have been two Presidential Commissions
J49 1150  2    on higher education since World War II. President
J49 1160  1    Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take
J49 1160  9    a liberal, expansionist position, while President Eisenhower's
J49 1170  6    Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly
J49 1180  9    more conservative. Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle-
J49 1190  8    and upper-class people, who attempted to act in the
J49 1200  7    public interest.
J49 1200  9       An example of a more definite class bias is noted
J49 1210  7    in proceedings of the Commission on the Financing of
J49 1220  4    Higher Education sponsored by the Association of American
J49 1230  2    Universities and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation
J49 1240  1    and the Carnegie Corporation. This Commission recommended
J49 1240  8    against the use of federal government funds for the
J49 1250  9    assistance of private universities and against a broad
J49 1260  5    program of government-supported scholarships. This
J49 1270  2    might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class
J49 1270 15    bias, but the Commission published as one of its staff
J49 1280 10    studies a book by Byron S. Hollingshead entitled Who
J49 1290  6    Should Go to College? which recommended a federal government
J49 1300  6    scholarship program. Furthermore, the Commission set
J49 1310  4    up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a
J49 1320  3    means of encouraging private business to increase its
J49 1320 11    support of private higher education. Thus, the Commission
J49 1330  8    acted with a sense of social responsibility within
J49 1340  6    the area of its own convictions about the problem of
J49 1350  5    government support to private education.
J49 1360  1       Then there are the trustees and officers of the
J49 1360  9    great educational foundations, who inevitably exert
J49 1370  4    an influence on educational decisions by their support
J49 1380  3    or refusal to support various educational programs,
J49 1380 10    experiments, and demonstrations. These people are practically
J49 1390  7    always upper- or upper-middle-class persons, who attempt
J49 1400  8    to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire
J49 1410  7    society.
J49 1410  8       Finally there are the parent organizations and the
J49 1420  6    laymen's organizations such as the National Association
J49 1430  3    of Parents and Teachers, and the Citizens Committee
J49 1440  1    on Public Schools. These have an upper-middle-class
J49 1440 10    leadership and a middle-class membership, with rare
J49 1450  8    exceptions, where working-class parents are active
J49 1460  4    in local P.-T.A. matters. Like the other policy-making
J49 1470  4    groups, these are middle class in their educational
J49 1480  1    attitudes, and they attempt to act in the general public
J49 1480 11    interest, as they see it.
J49 1490  5       In general it appears that educational decisions
J49 1500  1    and educational policies are made by people who intend
J49 1500 10    to act in the interests of the society as a whole.
J49 1510  8    They are predominantly middle- and upper-class people,
J49 1520  5    and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those
J49 1530  3    classes. They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class
J49 1540  1    values and consequently fail to take them into account.
J49 1540 10    But there is very little frank and conscious espousal
J49 1550  8    of the interests of any one social class by the people
J49 1560  6    who have the power to make decisions in education.
J49 1570  1    They think of themselves as trustees for the entire
J49 1570 10    society and try to serve the entire society.
J49 1580  8    #ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE SOCIAL STRUCTURE THROUGH EDUCATION#
J49 1590  4    Educational policy in the United States has as an explicit
J49 1600  5    goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity.
J49 1620  1    In so far as this goal is achieved, the society becomes
J49 1620 12    more fluid, artificial barriers to social mobility
J49 1630  7    are reduced, and people at the lower end of the social
J49 1640  8    hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural
J49 1650  3    goods of society. On the other hand, there is a counterbalancing
J49 1660  1    purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages
J49 1670  1    of the parents to their children. This leads to efforts
J49 1670 11    at exclusiveness through private schools and to the
J49 1690  7    maintenance of social stratification in the schools.
J49 1700  4    Both of these purposes exist side by side without much
J49 1710  1    overt conflict under present conditions.
J49 1710  6    #MAXIMIZING ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL OPPORTUNITY#
J49 1720  3    The broad expansion of free education results both
J49 1730  2    in raising the average economic and cultural level
J49 1730 10    of the society and in promoting fluidity within the
J49 1740  7    social structure. Fifty years ago the general raising
J49 1750  5    of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example
J49 1760  2    of this movement. During the past decade the program
J49 1760 11    has been carried on through expansion of free higher
J49 1770  8    education in state universities, state colleges, and
J49 1780  4    community colleges. The reaffirmation of American faith
J49 1790  3    in the comprehensive high school, as expressed in the
J49 1800  1    Conant study, is another indication of the liveliness
J49 1800  9    of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the
J49 1810  5    equalizing of educational opportunity.
J49 1820  1       The recent federal government's student-loan program
J49 1820  8    is another step in the direction of making higher education
J49 1830 10    more available to lower-status youth. It is probably
J49 1840  8    more effective than the expanded scholarship programs
J49 1850  3    of the past decade, because the scholarship programs
J49 1860  1    mainly aided the students with the best academic records
J49 1860 10    (who were usually middle-class), and these students
J49 1870  8    tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive
J49 1880  7    colleges. Meanwhile, the private colleges have increased
J49 1890  4    their tuition rates so much that they have raised an
J49 1900  2    economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds.
J49 1900  9    The gains in educational opportunity during the past
J49 1910  7    decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported
J49 1920  6    institutions.
