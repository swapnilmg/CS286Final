G72 0010  1    In a pessimistic assessment of the cold war, Eden declared:
G72 0010 11    "There must be much closer unity within the West before
G72 0020 10    there can be effective negotiation with the East".
G72 0030  5    Ordinary methods of diplomacy within the free world
G72 0040  4    are inadequate, said the former Prime Minister. "Something
G72 0050  2    much more thorough is required". Citing the experience
G72 0060  1    of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War II, Eden
G72 0060 12    said that all would have been confusion and disarray
G72 0070  9    without them. "This", he said, "is exactly what has
G72 0080  7    been happening between the politically free nations
G72 0090  3    in the postwar world. We need joint chiefs of a political
G72 0100  1    general staff". Citing the advances of Communist power
G72 0100  9    in recent years, Sir Anthony observed: "This very grave
G72 0110  9    state of affairs will continue until the free nations
G72 0120  8    accept together the reality of the danger that confronts
G72 0130  6    them and unite their policies and resources to meet
G72 0140  3    it".
G72 0140  4       While I fully agree with Sir Anthony's contention,
G72 0150  2    I think that we must carry the analysis farther, bearing
G72 0160  1    in mind that while common peril may be the measure
G72 0160 11    of our need, the existence or absence of a positive
G72 0170  8    sense of community must be the measure of our capacity.
G72 0180  5       While it is hazardous to project the trend of history,
G72 0190  5    it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully
G72 0200  1    emerging in the Western world, particularly among the
G72 0200  9    countries of Western Europe. At the end of World War
G72 0210 10    II, free Europe was ready for a new beginning. The
G72 0220  7    excesses of nationalism had brought down upon Europe
G72 0230  4    a generation of tyranny and war, and a return to the
G72 0240  1    old order of things seemed unthinkable. Under these
G72 0240  9    conditions a new generation of Europeans began to discover
G72 0250  7    the bonds of long association and shared values that
G72 0260  5    for so long had been subordinated to nationalist xenophobia.
G72 0270  2    A slow and painful trend toward unification has taken
G72 0280  1    hold, a trend which may at any time be arrested and
G72 0280 12    reversed but which may also lead to a binding federation
G72 0290  8    of Europe. It may well be that the unification of Europe
G72 0300  6    will prove inadequate, that the survival of free society
G72 0310  4    will require nothing less than the confederation of
G72 0320  1    the entire Western world.
G72 0320  5       The movement toward European unity has been expressed
G72 0330  4    in two currents: federalism and functionalism, one
G72 0340  2    looking to the constitution of a United States of Europe,
G72 0340 12    the other building on wartime precedents of practical
G72 0350  8    coo^peration for the solution of specific problems.
G72 0360  5    Thus far the advances made have been almost entirely
G72 0370  3    along functional lines.
G72 0370  6       Many factors contributed to the growth of the European
G72 0380  7    movement. In 1946 Sir Winston Churchill, who had spoken
G72 0390  4    often of European union during the war, advocated the
G72 0400  2    formation of "a kind of United States of Europe". Had
G72 0410  1    Churchill been returned to office in 1945, it is just
G72 0410 11    possible that Britain, instead of standing fearfully
G72 0420  6    aloof, would have led Europe toward union.
G72 0430  3       In 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coo^rdinated
G72 0440  2    efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation
G72 0450  1    of the Organization for European Economic Coo^peration
G72 0450  8    to supervise and coo^rdinate the uses of American aid
G72 0460  8    under the Marshall Plan. The United States might well
G72 0470  7    have exploited the opportunity provided by the European
G72 0480  5    Recovery Program to push the hesitant European nations
G72 0490  2    toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration,
G72 0500  1    but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the
G72 0500 11    United States Government at the time.
G72 0510  6       Another powerful factor in the European movement
G72 0520  4    was the threat of Soviet aggression. The Communist
G72 0530  1    coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately
G72 0530  9    by the conclusion of the Brussels Treaty, a 50-year
G72 0540  9    alliance among Britain, France and the Benelux countries.
G72 0550  6    And of course the Soviet threat was responsible for
G72 0560  4    NATO, the grand alliance of the Atlantic nations.
G72 0570  2       New organs of unification proliferated in the decade
G72 0580  1    following the conclusion of the NATO alliance. In
G72 0580  9    1949 the Council of Europe came into existence, a purely
G72 0590  8    consultative parliamentary body but the first organ
G72 0600  6    of political rather than functional unity. In 1952,
G72 0610  3    the European Coal and Steel Community was launched,
G72 0620  1    placing the coal and steel production of France, West
G72 0620 10    Germany, Italy and Benelux under a supranational High
G72 0630  7    Authority. For a time it appeared that a common European
G72 0640  6    army might be created, but the project for a European
G72 0650  4    Defense Community was rejected by the French National
G72 0660  1    Assembly in 1954. In 1957 the social-economic approach
G72 0660 10    to European integration was capped by the formation
G72 0670  7    among "the Six" of a tariff-free European Common Market,
G72 0680  7    and Euratom for coo^peration in the development of
G72 0690  5    atomic energy.
G72 0690  7       The "overseas" democracies have generally encouraged
G72 0700  4    the European unification movement without seriously
G72 0710  3    considering the wisdom of their own full participation
G72 0720  1    in a broader Atlantic community. The United States
G72 0720  9    and Canada belong only to NATO and the new O.E.C.D.
G72 0730  9    Britain until recently went along in some areas with
G72 0740  9    all of the enthusiasm of the groom at a shotgun wedding.
G72 0750  7    In other areas it held back, pleading its Commonwealth
G72 0760  3    bonds. Now Britain has decided to seek admission to
G72 0770  2    the European Economic Community and it seems certain
G72 0770 10    that she will be joined by some of her partners in
G72 0780  9    the loose Free Trade Area of the "Outer Seven". Besides
G72 0790  6    its historical significance as a break with the centuries-old
G72 0800  6    tradition of British insularity, Britain's move, if
G72 0810  3    successful, will constitute an historic landmark of
G72 0810 10    the first importance in the movement toward the unification
G72 0820  9    of Europe and the Western world.
G72 0830  4       If a broader Atlantic community is to be formed-
G72 0840  3    and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm
G72 0840 14    of both our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus
G72 0850  9    of machinery is at hand in the NATO alliance. The
G72 0860  6    time is now ripe, indeed overdue, for the vigorous
G72 0870  4    development of its non-military potentialities, for
G72 0880  1    its development as an instrument of Atlantic community.
G72 0880  9    What is required is the full implementation of Article
G72 0890  7    2 of the Treaty, which provides: "The Parties will
G72 0900  5    contribute toward the further development of peaceful
G72 0910  3    and friendly international relations by strengthening
G72 0920  1    their free institutions, by bringing about a better
G72 0920  9    understanding of the principles upon which these institutions
G72 0930  7    are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability
G72 0940  4    and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict
G72 0950  2    in their international economic policies and will encourage
G72 0960  1    economic collaboration between any and all of them".
G72 0960  9    As Lester Pearson wrote in 1955: "NATO cannot live
G72 0970  8    on fear alone. It cannot become the source of a real
G72 0980  8    Atlantic community if it remains organized to deal
G72 0990  4    only with the military threat which first brought it
G72 1000  2    into being".
G72 1000  4       The problem of NATO is not one of machinery, of
G72 1010  2    which there is an abundance, but of the will to use
G72 1010 13    it. The NATO Council is available as an executive
G72 1020  8    agency, the Standing Group as a high military authority.
G72 1030  7    The unofficial Conference of Parliamentarians is available
G72 1040  4    as a potential legislative authority. This machinery
G72 1050  3    will not become the instrument of an Atlantic community
G72 1060  1    by fiat, but only when that community evolves from
G72 1060 10    potentiality to reality. The existence of a community
G72 1070  7    is a state of mind- a conviction that goals and values
G72 1080  5    are widely shared, that effective communication is
G72 1090  2    possible, that mutual trust is reasonably assured.
G72 1090  9       An equally promising avenue toward Atlantic community
G72 1100  7    may lie through the development and expansion of the
G72 1110  6    O.E.C.D. Conceived as an organ of economic coo^peration,
G72 1120  6    there is no reason why O.E.C.D. cannot evolve into
G72 1130  4    a broader instrument of union if its members so desire.
G72 1140  3    Indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than
G72 1140 12    NATO for the development of a parliamentary organ
G72 1150  8    of the Atlantic nations, because it could encompass
G72 1160  6    all of the members of the Atlantic community including
G72 1170  3    those, like Sweden and Switzerland, who are unwilling
G72 1180  3    to be associated with an essentially military alliance
G72 1180 11    like NATO.
G72 1190  2       Underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a conviction
G72 1200  2    that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed
G72 1200 12    form a community, at least a potential community. There
G72 1210  9    is nothing new in this; what is new and compelling
G72 1220  8    is that the West is now but one of several powerful
G72 1230  4    civilizations, or "systems", and that one or more of
G72 1240  3    the others may pose a mortal danger to the West. For
G72 1240 14    centuries the North Atlantic nations dominated the
G72 1250  7    world and as long as they did they could afford the
G72 1260  6    luxury of fighting each other. That time is now past
G72 1270  4    and the Atlantic nations, if they are to survive, must
G72 1270 14    develop a full-fledged community, and they must also
G72 1280  9    look beyond the frontiers of "Western civilization"
G72 1290  4    toward a world-wide "concert of free nations".
G72 1300  3    #VI#
G72 1300  4    The burden of these reflections is that a broader unity
G72 1310  4    among the free nations is at the core of our needs.
G72 1320  1    And if we do not aspire to too much, it is also within
G72 1320 14    our capacity. A realistic balancing of the need for
G72 1330  8    new forms of international organization on the one
G72 1340  4    hand, and our capacity to achieve them on the other,
G72 1350  1    must be approached through the concept of "community".
G72 1350  9    History has demonstrated many times that concerts of
G72 1360  8    nations based solely on the negative spur of common
G72 1370  6    danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger
G72 1380  2    ceases to be dramatically urgent. Only when a concert
G72 1380 11    of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared
G72 1390  9    goals and values is it likely to form a viable instrument
G72 1400  9    of long-range policy. It follows that the solution
G72 1410  4    to the current disunity of the free nations is only
G72 1420  2    to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery
G72 1420 13    of consultation and coo^rdination. It is very much
G72 1430  7    a matter of building the foundations of community.
G72 1440  5       It is for these reasons that proposals for a "new
G72 1450  4    world order", through radical overhaul of the United
G72 1460  1    Nations or through some sort of world federation, are
G72 1460 10    utterly fatuous. In a recent book called "World Peace
G72 1470  9    Through World Law", two distinguished lawyers, Grenville
G72 1480  5    Clark and Louis Sohn, call for just such an overhaul
G72 1490  6    of the U.N., basing their case on the world-wide fear
G72 1500  5    of a nuclear holocaust. I believe that these proposals,
G72 1510  1    however meritorious in terms of world needs, go far
G72 1510 10    beyond our capacity to realize them. Such proposals
G72 1520  7    look to an apocalyptic act, a kind of Lockian "social
G72 1530  6    contract" on a world-wide scale. The defect of these
G72 1540  4    proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and
G72 1540 13    their assumption that because something may be desirable
G72 1550  8    it is also possible.
G72 1560  1       A working concept of the organic evolution of community
G72 1570  1    must lead us in a different direction. The failures
G72 1570 10    of the U.N. and of other international organs suggest
G72 1580  7    that we have already gone beyond what was internationally
G72 1590  4    feasible. Our problem, therefore, is to devise processes
G72 1600  3    more modest in their aspirations, adjusted to the real
G72 1610  1    world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile
G72 1610 10    communities. The history of the U.N. demonstrates that
G72 1620  8    in a pluralistic world we must develop processes of
G72 1630  7    influence and persuasion rather than coercion. It is
G72 1640  4    possible that international organization will ultimately
G72 1650  1    supplant the multi-state system, but its proper function
G72 1650 10    for the immediate future is to reform and supplement
G72 1660  8    that system in order to render pluralism more compatible
G72 1670  5    with an interdependent world.
G72 1680  1       New machinery of coo^rdination should not be our
G72 1680  9    primary objective in the foreseeable future- though
G72 1700  5    perhaps the "political general staff" of Western leaders
G72 1710  4    proposed by Sir Anthony Eden would serve a useful purpose.
G72 1720  4    Generally, however, there is an abundance of available
G72 1730  1    machinery of coo^rdination- in NATO, in O.E.C.D.,
G72 1750  1    in the U.N. and elsewhere. The trouble with this machinery
G72 1760  1    is that it is not used and the reason that it is not
G72 1760 14    used is the absence of a conscious sense of community
G72 1770  7    among the free nations.
G72 1780  1       Our proper objective, then, is the development of
G72 1780  9    a new spirit, the realization of a potential community.
G72 1790  6    A "concert of free nations" should take its inspiration
G72 1800  5    from the traditions of the nineteenth century Concert
G72 1810  2    of Europe with its common values and accepted "rules
G72 1820  1    of the game". Constitutions of and by themselves mean
G72 1820 10    little; the history of both the League of Nations and
G72 1830  9    the United Nations demonstrates that. But a powerful
G72 1840  5    sense of community, even with little or no machinery,
G72 1850  4    means a great deal. That is the lesson of the nineteenth
G72 1860  1    century.
G72 1860  2       A realistic "concert of free nations" might be expected
G72 1870  3    to consist of an "inner community" of the North Atlantic
G72 1880  1    nations and an "outer community" embracing much or
G72 1880  9    all of the non-Communist world.
