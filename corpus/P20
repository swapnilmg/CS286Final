P20 0010  1       I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the
P20 0010 11    sea. She made me welcome. Her dark cool caresses were
P20 0020  8    sweeter than any woman's; the many little tricks she
P20 0030  6    knew made her embrace the ultimate one- the ever more
P20 0040  4    fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not
P20 0040 12    me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic.
P20 0050 10    Yielding-Mediterranean-woman-flesh-of-water, she soothed
P20 0060  3    me, and drew me deeper into her.
P20 0070  1       I no longer knew how deep I was, somewhere under
P20 0070 11    230 feet, getting drunker, happier and more contented
P20 0080  7    by the second. The reasons for this dive seemed foolish
P20 0090  6    now. Only the dive itself had any meaning. The metal-tasting
P20 0100  4    nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece
P20 0110  1    and suck in the sweet water. Perhaps if I took off
P20 0110 12    the aqua-lung I could swim better, love my woman better.
P20 0120 11    I chuckled aloud, and the mouthpiece fell out.
P20 0130  6       While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming
P20 0140  4    down, a clear part sorted over recent events, among
P20 0150  2    them my only positive act in a long time. It was when
P20 0150 14    I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris. It was
P20 0160 12    no vacation, just me getting out after a bellyfull.
P20 0170  6    I knew it wouldn't be the same. Wild kicks never are,
P20 0180  4    but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind.
P20 0190  1       Once before I had been to Paris, long before I married
P20 0190 12    Valery. That first time was good and it stuck with
P20 0200 10    me. I was twenty-one back then, in the army, and fog
P20 0210  7    put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main. It
P20 0220  4    was a Saturday evening in April with a mist-like rain,
P20 0230  1    and I was a little high on the good taste of life.
P20 0230 13    I had a pocketful of money, which was unusual when
P20 0240  7    I was in the army, and the plane would be grounded
P20 0250  4    all night. In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel,
P20 0260  2    showered, shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees
P20 0260 11    in a fresh uniform. I felt like a Hun in Rome.
P20 0270  9       All the women were beautiful, and the men were equal
P20 0290  6    to them; everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes.
P20 0300  4    There were some sweet machines other than women: an
P20 0310  2    old Bugatti, a lean Farina coachwork on an American
P20 0310 11    chassis, a Swallow, a type 540-K Mercedes and lots
P20 0320  8    more. There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel-
P20 0330  7    I was no yokel, but I was young, and this was Paris!
P20 0340  6       I had champagne at Maxim's, then went into a cafe
P20 0350  6    called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre.
P20 0360  1    I never got there. I met Claire, which was better.
P20 0360 11    She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she
P20 0370 10    possibly could, and washing it down with red wine.
P20 0380  6    I stared. I didn't know a human could feed so fast
P20 0390  3    and still be beautiful. She was blonde, and young,
P20 0390 12    and nice and round in a tight white dress. Maybe her
P20 0400 10    ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so
P20 0410  6    positive about it.
P20 0410  9       When she had drained the last of the bottle and
P20 0420  8    paid her bill, she came directly to my table and said:
P20 0430  6       "Handsome soldier, I have assuaged one hunger with
P20 0440  4    food. I feel another of terrible urgency. Is your evening
P20 0450  1    free"?
P20 0450  2       "Madame", I said with noblesse oblige because of
P20 0460  2    the "handsome"- "yeah".
P20 0460  5       And so off we went to her apartment. She was a nymphomaniac,
P20 0470  8    of course, the poor girl. Toward the break of day I
P20 0480  6    waxed philosophical, and drew analogies about her way
P20 0490  3    of eating bread and cheese.
P20 0490  8       Now it was nine years later, and it wasn't spring
P20 0500  5    but winter when I returned.
P20 0500 10       I got there on a Saturday evening. I made the mistake
P20 0510 10    of going to the Jour et Nuit. The place was busy but
P20 0520  8    I didn't feel like a Hun. I sat waiting for Life to
P20 0540  6    come along and sweep me up. I had part of a bottle
P20 0550  2    of French beer called Panther Pils (so help me), then
P20 0550 12    switched to Tuborg. After a few hours, Life hadn't
P20 0560  9    showed, and I was crocked. I went to my hotel and slept.
P20 0570  8    The next morning a little cognac made me feel better-
P20 0580  5    but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning? So
P20 0590  2    I drank more cognac.
P20 0590  6       All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit
P20 0600  6    but not make deep space. I read the Tropic of Capricorn
P20 0610  3    and the Tropic of Cancer. Elemental, but sex. That's
P20 0620  2    what was on my mind. I was turning over the idea of
P20 0620 14    a good debauchery when I dozed off.
P20 0630  6       I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up. My
P20 0640  6    head was clear, my thinking sober and I was reconciled
P20 0650  1    to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others.
P20 0650 14    A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value.
P20 0660  8       Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and
P20 0670  7    it was snowing. I went out into it. I walked around
P20 0680  4    breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a
P20 0680 15    park, and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light
P20 0690 12    was dim and came from the sky. There was dignity and
P20 0700  8    beauty in the little white flakes falling through the
P20 0710  4    blue night. I had on only a topcoat, but I wasn't cold.
P20 0720  2    I was just miserable.
P20 0720  6       Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded
P20 0730  4    umbrella as a walking stick. She saw me and sat down
P20 0740  2    beside me, three feet away. Suddenly I understood why
P20 0740 11    she had the umbrella. It gave her poise and posture.
P20 0750  9    Without it she would have been drab and limp. It gave
P20 0760  7    her propriety. It gave her the right to sit down beside
P20 0770  5    me, back straight, one hand out on the handle. I couldn't
P20 0780  2    imagine her without it. I knew all about her. She was
P20 0780 13    another human being and happened to be a hustler. I
P20 0790 10    didn't much care if she were there or not.
P20 0800  6       After a while she said with sort of an unuttered
P20 0810  2    laugh, "You have snow in your hair and ears". (I didn't
P20 0820  1    have on a hat.)
P20 0820  5       Hardly glancing at her, I smiled a bleak one which
P20 0830  3    said, Thanks, baby, but I'd rather be alone.
P20 0830 11       She was silent for a while, then said, "Why are
P20 0840 10    you so unhappy"?
P20 0850  1       "I'm not unhappy", I lied, staring at the snow.
P20 0850 10    She was trying to make a hole in my armor, and I didn't
P20 0860 12    want it.
P20 0870  1       "Is it a woman"? she asked gently. She must have
P20 0870 11    seen the ring on my left hand.
P20 0880  5       "Well- women and unhappiness go together", I observed
P20 0890  3    profoundly, adding, "You can wager your derriere on
P20 0900  1    that".
P20 0900  2       "Ah, monsieur, it is not my business to wager it
P20 0910  1    ..."
P20 0910  2       This took me so funny I had to look at her. I felt
P20 0910 15    my frozen sad face crumble, and I grinned a silly one
P20 0920 11    I couldn't have helped. I even snorted a chuckle.
P20 0930  7       She smiled at me, but it was an awfully sad smile.
P20 0940  6    She was even more miserable than me. Her eyes were
P20 0950  2    smiling, too, but so sadly, and there was tiredness
P20 0950 11    and infinite wisdom in them. "Now isn't it better to
P20 0960  9    smile"? she asked.
P20 0970  1       Because I liked this sad person so much, I said,
P20 0970 11    "Will you have a drink with me"?
P20 0980  7       I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself
P20 0990  3    in her eyes, and I wondered how many men she had picked
P20 1000  1    up with this same gambit.
P20 1000  6       Anyway, I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of
P20 1010  5    my topcoat, drew the cork, and passed it to her.
P20 1020  1       I could see she was shocked.
P20 1020  7       "I'm sorry I haven't got a glass", I said.
P20 1030  6       "Non, non", she said, taking the bottle, "not for
P20 1040  4    that be sorry".
P20 1040  7       She tilted up and drank, and then I drank. It's
P20 1050  6    really rotten to drink good cognac like that, but I
P20 1060  4    hadn't cared before. I wasn't going to lug around a
P20 1070  1    glass.
P20 1070  2       There wasn't much light in the blue dark, but I
P20 1070 12    could see her well. No child, this tart, she must have
P20 1080 11    been thirty-five or even forty. I couldn't be sure.
P20 1090  7    Somehow she was attractive. Not good looking, but self-confident
P20 1100  6    and wise so that it made her attractive. I liked her,
P20 1110  4    and all at once I was glad she was there.
P20 1120  1       We finished the bottle- I hadn't had a lot out of
P20 1120 11    it earlier- not speaking much to each other, and we
P20 1130  8    stayed sober.
P20 1130 10       I suppose we were cold, but we didn't feel it. We
P20 1140 10    seemed to be drowsing, sadly, soberly, in the cold,
P20 1150  5    cold air while the snow fell. Then she said, "Allons",
P20 1160  2    and we got up and went to my hotel without another
P20 1160 13    word.
P20 1170  1       I sensed no stranger in her. We undressed and made
P20 1170 11    love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known
P20 1180  8    with Valery. I decided thirty-five was the best estimate
P20 1190  7    of her age. She had a funny little scar on her stomach,
P20 1200  5    on the left side.
P20 1200  9       I think we were very tired, for we awoke at the
P20 1210  7    same moment, deeply rested, surprised to see the late
P20 1220  4    morning sun on the windows, which were wet where the
P20 1220 14    rime had melted.
P20 1230  3       I felt wonderful, the absolute opposite of last
P20 1230 11    night's melancholy. My head was clear. I was hungry
P20 1240  9    as a wolf, and my body felt lean and vital.
P20 1250  7       "Bon jour", I said brightly, sitting up, which pulled
P20 1260  5    the covers to her hips. She looked good, with her short
P20 1270  3    tousled hair and no make-up. Maybe closer to thirty,
P20 1270 13    I thought.
P20 1280  2       "Bon jour"! she exclaimed, smiling. "J'ai faim"!
P20 1290  2    "Yeah, but breakfast first".
P20 1290  6       With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom. I called
P20 1300  8    downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her. She came
P20 1310  5    out pink from a hot bath, and I gave her my robe. I
P20 1320  2    had brushed my teeth, showered, shaved and dressed
P20 1320 10    by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast.
P20 1330  5       "The toothbrush monsieur", he said, presenting it.
P20 1340  4    I gave it to the woman.
P20 1340 10       "What is this for"? she asked innocently.
P20 1350  5       "Why, to brush your teeth".
P20 1360  1       "But I already have! I used yours".
P20 1360  8       "Oh"? I said with round eyes. I wondered if I ought
P20 1370 11    to go use the new one myself. But I smelled the coffee,
P20 1380  8    and thinking, What the hell, live dangerously, I decided
P20 1390  5    I would scald my worries away. The coffee wasn't very
P20 1400  3    hot though, made in a filter pot, but it was good.
P20 1410  1    We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount
P20 1410 11    of cold ham, hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread.
P20 1420  8    As we ate, we talked. Her name was Suzanne, and mine
P20 1430  5    Stephen.
P20 1430  6       We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last
P20 1440  6    cups of coffee.
P20 1440  9       "You are very tactful, do you know, Stephen", she
P20 1450  6    remarked.
P20 1450  7       "Um"? I grunted, sipping.
P20 1460  2       "Yes, because you didn't run off to use that new
P20 1470  2    toothbrush".
P20 1470  3       I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror.
P20 1480  1       "I didn't really use yours", she went on. "I carry
P20 1490  1    one in my purse. I know men never kiss les putains".
P20 1500  1       To my immense relief, she changed the subject in
P20 1500  9    the next sentence: "Shall we go to the Louvre today"?
P20 1510  8       "All right". I said with enthusiasm at the idea.
P20 1520  7    "But not immediately". I put aside my empty cup. She
P20 1530  6    smiled all the way to her wise, sad eyes, and drained
P20 1540  2    her own.
P20 1540  4       We were not rushed.
P20 1540  8       "What is this from"? I asked, touching the scar
P20 1550  7    on her stomach. It was like a long thin line drawn
P20 1560  5    through a pink circle.
P20 1560  9       "A bullet", she answered. The cynicism was back
P20 1570  6    in her eyes, a bitter wisdom, and I wondered if forty
P20 1580  4    were not so far wrong after all. She understood sex
P20 1590  1    anyway, and played at it well.
P20 1590  7       We went to the Louvre for a few hours, then by Metro
P20 1600  6    to a cabaret in Montmartre.
P20 1600 11       It was a nice place, not filled with smoke. We had
P20 1610 10    champagne and steamed mussels. The sommelier brought
P20 1620  4    the wine first, a magnum instead of the bottle I had
P20 1630  5    ordered. He must have thought I was a tourist.
P20 1640  1       I fixed him with a steely eye and said, "What's
P20 1640 11    this for? I didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne".
P20 1650  9       I thought that was pretty humorous, but I didn't
P20 1660  7    laugh.
