G31 0010  1    Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was
G31 0010  9    crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara's
G31 0020  7    epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to
G31 0030  6    her as "the Sulamite".
G31 0030 10       Into the texture of this tapestry of history and
G31 0040  9    human drama Henrietta, as every artist delights to
G31 0050  6    do, wove strands of her own intuitive insights into
G31 0060  2    human nature and- especially in the remarkable story
G31 0065  6    of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate
G31 0070  8    and fervent characters as this pair- into the relations
G31 0080  7    of men and women: "In their relations, she was the
G31 0090  5    giver and he the receiver, nay the demander. His feeling
G31 0100  2    always exacted sacrifices from her. ... One is so accustomed
G31 0110  1    to think of men as the privileged who need but ask
G31 0110 12    and receive, and women as submissive and yielding,
G31 0120  6    that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side
G31 0130  4    of the man whose love is not returned, and we condemn
G31 0140  1    the woman as a coquette ... The very firmness of her
G31 0140 12    convictions and logical clearness of her arguments
G31 0150  6    captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts;
G31 0160  4    usually, this is most exasperating to men, who expect
G31 0170  2    every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning
G31 0170 10    her sex, and when she does not, immediately condemn
G31 0180  9    her as eccentric and unwomanly ... She had the opportunity
G31 0190  7    that few clever women can resist, of showing her superiority
G31 0200  5    in argument over a man ... Women themselves have come
G31 0210  3    to look upon matters in the same light as the outside
G31 0220  1    world, and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to
G31 0220 10    the importunities of a stronger will, even when their
G31 0230  8    affections are withheld ... She was exposing herself
G31 0240  5    to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can
G31 0250  3    consistently be done. One who invites such trials of
G31 0250 12    character is either foolhardy, overconfident or too
G31 0260  7    simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the
G31 0270  6    danger. In any case but the last, such a course is
G31 0280  2    sure to avenge itself upon the individual; the moral
G31 0280 11    powers no more than the physical and mental, can bear
G31 0290 10    overstraining. And, in the last case, a bitter disappointment
G31 0300  7    but too often meets the confiding nature ...".
G31 0310  3       Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing,
G31 0320  2    as the born writer does, not merely a channel for the
G31 0320 13    discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus
G31 0330  7    to the development of the creative powers of observation,
G31 0340  5    insight and intuition.
G31 0340  8       Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her
G31 0350 10    biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered
G31 0360  6    submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but
G31 0370  4    he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not
G31 0380  3    interest them and published it in The Messenger, "so
G31 0390  2    our readers will be benefited instead". Under her father's
G31 0400  1    influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might
G31 0400 11    write on subjects outside the Jewish field, but she
G31 0410  7    did begin writing for other Anglo-Jewish papers and
G31 0420  3    thus increased her output and her audience. And she
G31 0430  2    wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of
G31 0430 12    Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival
G31 0440  6    which came in December. By her eighteenth birthday
G31 0450  5    her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma
G31 0460  4    gave her a Life of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration.
G31 0470  1       Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened
G31 0480  1    to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins
G31 0480 12    University within walking distance of home. It was
G31 0490  7    established in a couple of buildings in the shopping
G31 0500  4    district, with only a few professors, but all eminent
G31 0510  1    men, and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby
G31 0510 11    dwellings. In September '76 Thomas Huxley, Darwin's
G31 0520  7    famous disciple, came from England to speak in a crowded
G31 0530  8    auditorium at the formal opening of the University;
G31 0540  4    and although it was a school for men only, it afforded
G31 0550  2    Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures.
G31 0560  1       In the following year her father undertook to give
G31 0560 10    a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students,
G31 0570  6    and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright
G31 0580  6    young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study, and
G31 0590  3    who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained
G31 0600  1    by Henrietta and Rachel, who played and sang for them
G31 0600 11    in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings. From
G31 0610  7    Philadelphia came Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jastrow. Adler,
G31 0620  3    Judge Sulzberger's nephew, came to study Assyriology.
G31 0630  1    A smart, shrewd and ambitious young man, well connected,
G31 0630 10    and with a knack for getting in the good graces of
G31 0640 10    important people, he was bound to go far. Joseph Jastrow,
G31 0650  7    the younger son of the distinguished rabbi, Marcus
G31 0660  3    Jastrow, was a friendly, round-faced fellow with a
G31 0670  1    little mustache, whose field was psychology, and who
G31 0670  9    was also a punster and a jolly tease. His father was
G31 0680  8    a good friend of Rabbi Szold, and Joe lived with the
G31 0690  5    Szolds for a while. Both these youths, who greatly
G31 0700  1    admired Henrietta, were somewhat younger than she,
G31 0700  8    as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys, who
G31 0715  3    were then studying medicine; and bright though they
G31 0720  5    all were, they could not possibly compete for her interest
G31 0730  3    with Papa, whose mind- although he never tried to dazzle
G31 0740  1    or patronize lesser lights with it- naturally eclipsed
G31 0740  9    theirs and made them seem to her even younger than
G31 0750  9    they were. Besides, Miss Henrietta- as she was generally
G31 0760  7    known since she had put up her hair with a chignon
G31 0770  4    in the back- had little time to spare them from her
G31 0780  1    teaching and writing; so Cyrus Adler became interested
G31 0780  9    in her friend Racie Friedenwald, and Joe Jastrow- the
G31 0790  7    only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to
G31 0800  7    address her as Henrietta, and signed himself Joe- fell
G31 0810  4    in love with pretty sister Rachel.
G31 0810 10       Henrietta, however, was at that time engaged in
G31 0820  8    a lengthy correspondence with Joe's older and more
G31 0830  5    serious brother, Morris, who was just about her own
G31 0840  3    age and whom she had got to know well during trips
G31 0840 14    to Philadelphia with Papa, when he substituted for
G31 0850  7    Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph Shalom Temple there during
G31 0860  5    its Rabbi's absence in Europe. Young Morris, who, while
G31 0870  4    attending the University of Pennsylvania, also taught
G31 0880  2    and edited a paper, found time to write Henrietta twenty-page
G31 0890  1    letters on everything that engaged his interest, from
G31 0890  9    the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his
G31 0900  6    reactions to the comments of "Sulamith" on the Jewish
G31 0910  5    reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union
G31 0920  3    College in Cincinnati. Unlike his younger brother,
G31 0930  1    Joe, he never presumed to address her more familiarly
G31 0930 10    than as "My dear friend", although he praised and envied
G31 0940  8    the elegance and purity of her style. And when he complained
G31 0950  8    of the lack of time for all he wanted to do, Henrietta
G31 0960  6    advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and
G31 0970  4    Papa did.
G31 0970  6       One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how
G31 0980  3    to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated
G31 0980 13    as herself. She could not resist the opportunity "of
G31 0990  9    showing her superiority in argument over a man" which
G31 1000  7    she had remarked as one of the "feminine follies" of
G31 1010  4    Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta,
G31 1020  2    who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness
G31 1030  1    "to think of men as the privileged" and "women as submissive
G31 1040  1    and yielding", felt obliged to defend vigorously any
G31 1040  9    statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the
G31 1050  7    slightest exception- he objected to her stand on the
G31 1060  6    Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of
G31 1070  2    Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College- until once, in sheer
G31 1080  1    desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they
G31 1080 11    would ever agree on anything. But that did not prevent
G31 1090  8    him from writing more long letters, or from coming
G31 1100  4    to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable,
G31 1110  1    lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street.
G31 1110 10    #1880S: "LITTLE WOMEN"#
G31 1120  3    "WE'VE GOT Father and Mother and each other ..." said
G31 1130  6    Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott's Little Women;
G31 1140  3    and, "I do think that families are the most beautiful
G31 1150  3    things in all the world", burst out Jo some five hundred
G31 1160  1    pages later in that popular story of the March family,
G31 1160 11    which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight;
G31 1170  7    and the Szold family, as it developed, bore a striking
G31 1180  6    resemblance to the Marches.
G31 1180 10       Mr. March, like Benjamin Szold, was a clergyman,
G31 1190  8    although of an indeterminate denomination; and "Marmee"
G31 1200  4    March, like Sophie Szold, was the competent manager
G31 1210  5    of her brood of girls, of whom the Marches had only
G31 1220  3    four to the Szolds' five. But the March girls had their
G31 1230  1    counterparts in the Szold girls. Henrietta could easily
G31 1230  9    identify herself with Jo March, although Jo was not
G31 1240  9    the eldest sister. Neither was Henrietta hoydenish
G31 1250  4    like Jo, who frankly wished she were a boy and had
G31 1260  4    deliberately shortened her name, which, like Henrietta's,
G31 1270  1    was the feminine form of a boy's name. But both were
G31 1270 12    high-spirited and vivacious, both had tempers to control,
G31 1280  8    both loved languages, especially English and German,
G31 1290  5    both were good teachers and wrote for publication.
G31 1300  2    Each was her mother's assistant and confidante; and
G31 1310  1    each stood out conspicuously in the family picture.
G31 1310  9       Bertha Szold was more like Meg, the eldest March
G31 1320  8    girl, who "learned that a woman's happiest kingdom
G31 1330  4    is home, her highest honor the art of ruling it, not
G31 1340  3    as a queen, but a wise wife and mother". Bertha, blue-eyed
G31 1350  1    like Mamma, was from the start her mother's daughter,
G31 1350 10    destined for her mother's role in life. Sadie, like
G31 1360  8    Beth March, suffered ill health- got rheumatic fever
G31 1370  4    and had to be careful of her heart- but that never
G31 1380  4    dampened her spirits. When her right hand was incapacitated
G31 1390  1    by the rheumatism, Sadie learned to write with her
G31 1390 10    left hand. She wrote gay plays about the girls for
G31 1400  8    family entertainments, like "Oh, What Fun! A comedy
G31 1410  5    in Three Acts", in which, under "Personages", Henrietta
G31 1420  2    appeared as "A Schoolmarm", and Bertha, who was only
G31 1430  4    a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta
G31 1440  1    had been, appeared as "Dummkopf". Sadie studied piano;
G31 1440  9    played Chopin in the "Soiree Musicale of Mr. Guthrie's
G31 1450  9    Pupils"; and she recited "Hector's Farewell to Andromache"
G31 1460  8    most movingly, to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow
G31 1470  9    at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia, where
G31 1480  4    the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits
G31 1490  4    of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore. Adele,
G31 1500  2    like Amy, the youngest of the Marches, was the rebellious,
G31 1510  1    mischievous, rather calculating and ambitious one.
G31 1510  7    For Rachel, conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold
G31 1520  9    girls- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in
G31 1530  6    the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in
G31 1540  2    her silvery tones- there was no particular March counterpart;
G31 1550  1    but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual
G31 1550 11    differences the family life in both cases was remarkably
G31 1560  9    similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content- the
G31 1570  7    one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian.
G31 1580  6       The Szolds, like the Marches, enjoyed and loved
G31 1590  4    living together, even in troubled times; and, as in
G31 1600  3    the March home, any young man who called on the Szolds
G31 1600 14    found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity
G31 1610  8    which made it rather difficult to direct his particular
G31 1620  5    attention to any one of them. This included Mamma,
G31 1630  3    jolly, generous, and pretty, with whom they all fell
G31 1640  1    in love, just as Papa had first fallen in love with
G31 1640 12    her Mamma before he chose her; and when a young man
G31 1650  9    like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality,
G31 1660  4    he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts
G31 1670  3    not merely to Henrietta, in whom he was really interested,
G31 1680  1    but to all the Szold girls and Mamma. And just as "Laurie"
G31 1680 13    Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March, who
G31 1690  9    found him immature by her high standards, and then
G31 1700  7    had to content himself with her younger sister Amy,
G31 1710  3    so Joe Jastrow, who had also been writing Henrietta
G31 1720  1    before he came to Johns Hopkins, had to content himself
G31 1720 11    with her younger sister, pretty Rachel. And like Jo
G31 1730  8    March, who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in
G31 1740  6    "lovering" before herself, Henrietta saw her sisters
G31 1750  4    Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle
G31 1760  1    by the attraction of suitors, Rachel by Joe Jastrow,
G31 1760 10    and Sadie by Max Lo^bl, a young businessman who would
G31 1770  8    write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat
G31 1780  6    down the Mississippi.
