L18 0010  1       "She says she has to finish a story". He shrugged.
L18 0010 11    "I asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow, but it
L18 0020 11    seems the muse is working good tonight and she's afraid
L18 0030  7    to let it go".
L18 0030 11       Casey made some comment, but his mind was busy as
L18 0040 10    he considered the man. His name was George Needham
L18 0050  5    and he, too, had come from a good family. He was perhaps
L18 0060  4    thirty-two, nicely set up, with light brown hair that
L18 0070  1    had a pronounced wave. He was always well groomed and
L18 0070 11    well tailored, and he had that rich man's look which
L18 0080  9    was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools
L18 0090  6    and a proper university. An only child, he had done
L18 0100  3    all the things that young men do who have been born
L18 0100 14    to money and social position until his father double-crossed
L18 0110  9    him by dying broke. Since then he had worked at this
L18 0120  8    and that, though some said his main interest was gambling.
L18 0130  4       All this went through Casey's mind in the first
L18 0140  4    instant, but what held his interest was the fact that
L18 0150  1    these two should be together at all. For he had understood
L18 0150 12    that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry Jenkins.
L18 0160 10    She had grown up with young Jenkins, and he had heard
L18 0170  7    that they had been at the point of getting married
L18 0180  3    at least twice. He wanted to ask her about Jenkins
L18 0190  1    now, but he knew he couldn't do so in Needham's presence.
L18 0190 12    And so, still wondering and a little perplexed, he
L18 0200  8    grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure
L18 0210  6    that she would know he was kidding.
L18 0220  1       "Where did you pick him up"?
L18 0220  7       "Oh, I've known him quite a while". She glanced
L18 0230  5    at her companion fondly. "Haven't I, George"?
L18 0240  2       "I've been after her for years", Needham said, "but
L18 0250  3    I've never been able to get anywhere until the last
L18 0260  1    few days".
L18 0260  3       The girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached
L18 0270  1    out and touched Casey's hand. "Can I tell you a secret?
L18 0280  1    We're going to get married. Do you approve"?
L18 0280  9       Casey kept his smile fixed, but some small inner
L18 0290  8    disturbance was working on him as he thought again
L18 0300  4    about Needham, who was eight or ten years older than
L18 0310  1    the girl. He wondered whether Needham was going to
L18 0310 10    swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether
L18 0320  8    he was counting on the income from Betty's estate to
L18 0330  4    subsidize him. None of this showed in his face, and
L18 0340  2    he tried to keep his skepticism in hand. He made a
L18 0340 13    point of frowning, of acting out the part of the fond
L18 0350  9    father-confessor.
L18 0350 11       "I'll have to give it some thought", he said. "You
L18 0360 10    wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his
L18 0370  9    intentions are honorable, would you"?
L18 0380  2       She made a face at him and then she laughed. "Of
L18 0390  1    course not".
L18 0390  3       "I'll get my references in order", Needham said,
L18 0400  2    and though he spoke with a smile, Casey somehow got
L18 0400 12    the idea that he was not particularly amused. "Stop
L18 0410  8    by any time, Casey". He stood up and touched the girl's
L18 0420  8    arm. "Come on, darling. If you're really serious about
L18 0430  5    working on that story, I'd better take you home".
L18 0440  3       Casey watched them go, still frowning absently and
L18 0450  2    then dismissing the matter as he called for his check.
L18 0450 12    As he went out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect,
L18 0460  9    and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy Parks and
L18 0470  7    put a fifty-piece piece in the slot, he told her to
L18 0480  5    be sure that it went toward her dowry.
L18 0480 13       A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where
L18 0490 10    he had left his car, and a few minutes later he found
L18 0500  5    a parking place across the street from his apartment.
L18 0510  1    Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the
L18 0510 10    past couple of hours, he did not think to look and
L18 0520 10    see if Jerry Burton's car was still there. In fact,
L18 0530  7    he did not think about Jerry Burton at all until he
L18 0540  4    entered his living room and closed the door behind
L18 0540 13    him. Only then, when his glance focused on the divan
L18 0550 10    and saw that it was empty, did he remember his earlier
L18 0560  7    problem.
L18 0560  8       Even from where he stood he could see the neatly
L18 0570  7    folded blanket that he had spread over Burton, the
L18 0580  3    pillow, the sheet of paper on top of it. Then he was
L18 0580 15    striding across the room, his thoughts confused but
L18 0590  8    the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched
L18 0600  6    up the note.
L18 0600  9    ##
L18 0600 10    Jack:
L18 0601  1       Look in the wastebasket. I knew the only way I could
L18 0610 10    beat you was to play possum, but it was a good try,
L18 0620  7    kid, and I appreciate it.
L18 0620 12       J.
L18 0621  1    ##
L18 0630  1    The wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan,
L18 0630 11    and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had
L18 0640  9    happened. The discarded papers inside were sodden,
L18 0650  4    there was a glint of liquid at the bottom, and the
L18 0660  2    smell of whisky was strong and distinct. He put the
L18 0660 12    basket down distastefully, muttering softly and thoroughly
L18 0670  6    disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed
L18 0680  7    so foolproof. For he remembered too well how he had
L18 0690  4    brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned
L18 0700  1    to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself.
L18 0700 10       For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance
L18 0710 10    that was directed at himself; then his mind moved on
L18 0720  6    to be confronted by something far more serious, and
L18 0730  3    as the thought expanded, the implications jarred him.
L18 0730 11    It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him.
L18 0740  9    The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere
L18 0750  7    to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket. And
L18 0760  5    that gun was empty.
L18 0760  9       Even before his mind had rounded out the idea, he
L18 0770  7    thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled
L18 0780  3    out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver. He
L18 0780 14    considered them with brooding eyes, brows bunched as
L18 0790  8    his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find
L18 0800  7    some solution. He said: "The crazy fool", half aloud.
L18 0810  4    He put the shells on the table, as though he could
L18 0820  2    no longer bear to hold them. He thought: Where the
L18 0820 12    hell could he have gone? How can I find him?
L18 0830 10       There was no answer to this and he began to pace
L18 0840  8    back and forth across the room, his imagination out
L18 0850  3    of control. He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton
L18 0860  1    had sobered up enough to get some sense. Maybe he only
L18 0860 12    intended to scare the blackmailer, whoever he was,
L18 0870  7    in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough.
L18 0880  5    He thought of other possibilities, none of them satisfactory,
L18 0890  2    and finally he began to think, to wonder if there was
L18 0900  1    some way he could reach Burton. Then, as he turned
L18 0900 11    toward the telephone, it rang shrilly to shatter the
L18 0910  7    stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly.
L18 0920  4       "Yeah", he said.
L18 0920  7       "Casey"?
L18 0930  1       "Yeah".
L18 0930  2       "Tony Calenda".
L18 0930  4       Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who
L18 0940  8    it was, but it took him a while to make the mental
L18 0950  4    readjustment and control the disturbance inside his
L18 0960  1    head. When he heard Calenda say: "What about that picture
L18 0960 11    you took this afternoon"? it still took him another
L18 0970  8    few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank
L18 0980  8    Ackerly.
L18 0980  9       "What picture"? he demanded.
L18 0990  3       "You took a picture of me at the corner of Washington
L18 1000  2    and Blake about three thirty this afternoon".
L18 1010  1       "Who says so"?
L18 1010  4       "One of my boys".
L18 1010  8       Casey believed that much. Calenda was not the sort
L18 1020  8    who walked around without one of his "boys" close at
L18 1030  6    hand.
L18 1030  7       "So"?
L18 1030  8       "With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week
L18 1040 10    I wouldn't want that picture published".
L18 1050  3       "Who says it's going to be published"?
L18 1060  1       "I wouldn't even want it to get around".
L18 1070  1       Under normal circumstances Casey was a little fussy
L18 1070  9    when people told him what to do with pictures he had
L18 1080  9    taken. Even so, he generally listened and was usually
L18 1090  4    reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly.
L18 1100  2    Right now, however, he was still too worried about
L18 1100 11    Jerry Burton, and the gun that had no bullets, and
L18 1110 10    the story Burton had told him, to care too much about
L18 1120  7    Tony Calenda. His nerves were getting a little ragged
L18 1130  4    and his impatience put an edge in his voice.
L18 1140  1       "Look", he said. "I was hired to take a picture.
L18 1140 10    I took it. That's all I know about it and that's all
L18 1150 10    I care".
L18 1150 12       "Maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what
L18 1160 10    I said".
L18 1170  1       "You tell him".
L18 1170  4       "All right", Calenda said, his voice still quiet.
L18 1180  3    "But I meant what I said, Casey. If that picture gets
L18 1190  2    around and I find out you had anything to do with it,
L18 1190 14    I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see
L18 1200 12    you".
L18 1200 13       "You do that", Casey said. "Just be sure to send
L18 1210 10    your two best boys, Tony".
L18 1220  2       He hung up with a bang, annoyed at himself for running
L18 1230  1    off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned
L18 1230 11    with the situation he had helped to create. As soon
L18 1240  8    as he could think logically again he reached for the
L18 1250  6    telephone directory and found Jerry Burton's home number.
L18 1260  3    He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before
L18 1270  1    he hung up. He called the bar and grill where he had
L18 1270 13    picked Burton up that afternoon. When he was told that
L18 1280  9    no one had seen Burton since then, he thought of three
L18 1290  6    other places that were possibilities. Each time he
L18 1300  3    got the same answer and in the end he gave up.
L18 1300 14       By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had
L18 1310 10    calmed down. He had done all he could and that was
L18 1320  7    that. And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who
L18 1330  4    would be likely to get in trouble even when he was
L18 1330 15    drunk. He, Casey, had been scared for a while, but
L18 1340 10    that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible.
L18 1350  7    He should have stayed here and watched Burton. He didn't.
L18 1360  5    So he made a mistake. So what?
L18 1370  1       He kept telling himself this as he went out to the
L18 1370 12    kitchen to make a drink. Only then did he decide he
L18 1380  9    didn't want one. He considered opening a can of beer
L18 1390  6    but vetoed that idea too. Finally he went into the
L18 1400  2    bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes. He had
L18 1400 13    just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone
L18 1410  8    rang again. When he snatched it up the voice that came
L18 1420  7    to him was quick and urgent.
L18 1420 13       "Casey? You don't know me but I know you. If you
L18 1430 11    want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark
L18 1440  9    just as fast as you can. If you hurry you might beat
L18 1450  5    the headquarters boys".
L18 1450  8       Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before
L18 1460  7    he could open his mouth, and it took him no more than
L18 1470  6    three seconds to make his decision. For over the years
L18 1480  3    he had received many such calls. Some of them came
L18 1480 13    from people who identified themselves. Some telephoned
L18 1490  6    because he had done them a favor in the past. Others
L18 1500  8    because they expected some sort of reward for the information.
L18 1510  5    A few passed along a tip for the simple reason that
L18 1520  3    they liked him and wanted to give him a break. Only
L18 1530  1    an occasional tip turned out to be a phony, and, like
L18 1530 12    the police, Casey had made a point of running down
L18 1540  8    all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time.
L18 1550  4       He was in his car with his camera and equipment
L18 1560  1    bag in less than two minutes, and it took him only
L18 1560 12    three more to reach the corner, a block from Columbus
L18 1570  9    Avenue. It was a district of small factories and loft
L18 1580  6    buildings and occasional tenements, and he could see
L18 1590  4    the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed
L18 1600  1    on the brakes. He did not bother with his radio- there
L18 1600 12    would be time for that later- but as he scrambled out
L18 1610  9    on the pavement he saw the filling station and the
L18 1620  5    public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had
L18 1630  3    been summoned.
L18 1630  5       The police car had pulled up behind a small sedan,
L18 1640  3    its headlights still on.
