G21 0010  1    AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC THOUGHT, pointed up the relation
G21 0010  8    between the Protestant movement in this country and
G21 0020  7    the development of a social religion, which he called
G21 0030  5    the American Democratic Faith. Those familiar with
G21 0040  2    his work will remember that he placed the incipience
G21 0040 11    of the democratic faith at around 1850. And he describes
G21 0050  9    it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the
G21 0060  6    free individual and what he called the fundamental
G21 0070  3    law.
G21 0070  4       I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental
G21 0080  2    law. But first I want to quote him on the relationship
G21 0090  1    that he found between religion and politics in this
G21 0090 10    country and what happened to it. He points out that
G21 0100  9    from the time of Jackson on through World War I,
G21 0110  5    evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence
G21 0120  1    in the social and political life of America. He terms
G21 0120 11    this early enthusiasm "Romantic Christianity" and concludes
G21 0130  7    that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day
G21 0140  8    is so great that "the doctrine of liberty seems but
G21 0150  5    a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical
G21 0160  1    Protestantism". Let me quote him even more fully, for
G21 0160 10    his analysis is important to my theme.
G21 0170  7       He says: "Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress,
G21 0180  5    as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism,
G21 0190  2    should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith
G21 0200  2    which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of
G21 0200 13    the United States to assist in the creation of a better
G21 0210 10    world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy".
G21 0220  5    He specifies, "In the middle period of the Nineteenth
G21 0230  4    Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism,
G21 0240  1    in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism.
G21 0240 10    But in every period it has been humanism". And let
G21 0250  9    me add, utopianism, also.
G21 0260  1       Some fourteen or fifteen years ago, in an essay
G21 0260 10    I called The Leader Follows- Where? I used his polarity
G21 0270  9    to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in
G21 0280  9    that form of liberalism we call Progressivism. It seemed
G21 0290  4    to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity
G21 0300  3    and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in
G21 0310  2    the common man. That is to say Gabriel's fundamental
G21 0310 11    law had been so much modified by this time that it
G21 0320  9    was neither fundamental nor law any more. It is a weakness
G21 0330  8    of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize
G21 0340  4    that his so-called fundamental law had already been
G21 0350  1    cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted
G21 0350 10    to democracy. And with Progressivism the Religion of
G21 0360  6    Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian
G21 0370  3    supernaturalism. And the common man was developing
G21 0380  1    mythic power, or charisma, on his own.
G21 0380  8       During the decade that followed, the common man,
G21 0390  6    as that piece put it, grew uncomfortable as the Voice
G21 0400  4    of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow (Wilson)
G21 0410  1    only to learn from Science, to his shocked relief that
G21 0410 11    after all there was no God he had to speak for and
G21 0420 10    that he was just an animal anyhow- that there was a
G21 0430  7    chemical formula for him, and that too much couldn't
G21 0440  1    be expected of him.
G21 0440  5       The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt
G21 0450  4    Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a far
G21 0460  2    cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to
G21 0460 11    the Constitution, or of the Jacksonian frontier. What
G21 0470  7    had happened to the common man?
G21 0480  2       French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence
G21 0490  1    in this country before the days of Popularism. The
G21 0490 10    riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern
G21 0500  8    Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion
G21 0510  6    of Humanity, however, prepared the way for a reception
G21 0520  6    of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of
G21 0530  2    one sort of another. The first of which to find important
G21 0530 13    place in our federal government was the graduated income
G21 0540  9    tax under Wilson. Moreover the centralization of our
G21 0550  6    economy during the 1920s, the dislocations of the Depression,
G21 0560  5    the common ethos of Materialism everywhere, all contributed
G21 0570  3    in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike
G21 0580  2    Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy
G21 0590  1    of the Little People.
G21 0590  5       However, it is important to trace the philosophy
G21 0600  2    of the French Revolution to its sources to understand
G21 0600 11    the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism
G21 0610  8    and the influence of the latter on the former. That
G21 0620  8    John Locke's philosophy of the social contract fathered
G21 0630  5    the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence,
G21 0640  3    I believe, we generally accept. Yet, after Rousseau
G21 0650  2    had given the social contract a new twist with his
G21 0650 12    notion of the General Will, the same philosophy, it
G21 0660  9    may be said, became the idea source of the French Revolution
G21 0670  8    also.
G21 0670  9       The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always
G21 0680  7    been clear to us, however. This notion of the General
G21 0690  5    Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution
G21 0700  3    and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship. And it
G21 0710  1    is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle, in his
G21 0710 11    remarkable long essay, The Heresy of Democracy, and
G21 0720  7    in a more general way by Voegelin, in his New Science
G21 0730  6    of Politics, that this same Rousseauan idea, descending
G21 0740  3    through European democracy, is the source of Marx's
G21 0750  2    theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This
G21 0750 10    is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire
G21 0760  7    liberals found themselves in after World War II and
G21 0770  7    our great democratic victory that brought no peace.
G21 0780  5       The long road that had taken liberals in this country
G21 0790  3    into the social religion of democracy, into a worship
G21 0790 12    of man, led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless
G21 0800 11    society under a Socialist State. And the USSR existed
G21 0810  8    as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism,
G21 0820  5    the ultimate exemplar. And by the time the war ended,
G21 0830  5    liberal leadership in this country was spiritually
G21 0840  1    Marxist.
G21 0840  2       We will recall that the still confident liberals
G21 0840 10    of the Truman administration gathered with other Western
G21 0850  8    utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework,
G21 0860  9    finally and at last, to rationalize war- to rationalize
G21 0870  5    want and fear- out of the world: the United Nations.
G21 0880  4    We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and
G21 0890  2    rehabilitation. Then suddenly we found ourselves in
G21 0890  9    the middle of another fight, an irrational, an indecent,
G21 0900  8    an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest (and
G21 0910  6    some had thought noblest) ally.
G21 0920  1       During the next five years the leaders of the Fair
G21 0920 11    Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations
G21 0930  7    of the New Deal. During the next five years liberal
G21 0940  6    leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative
G21 0950  3    confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative
G21 0960  1    policy of Containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced
G21 0960  9    and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we
G21 0970  9    felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon:
G21 0980  6    the atom bomb. In 1952, it will be remembered, the
G21 0990  2    G.O.P. without positive program campaigned on the popular
G21 1000  2    disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.
G21 1010  1       All of this, I know, is recent history familiar
G21 1010 10    to you. But I have been at some pains to review it
G21 1020 10    as the drama of the common man, to point up what happened
G21 1030  7    to him under Eisenhower's leadership.
G21 1040  1       A perceptive journalist, Sam Lubell, has phrased
G21 1040  8    it in the title of one of his books as THE REVOLT OF
G21 1050 11    THE MODERATES. He opens his discourse, however, with
G21 1060  5    a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at
G21 1070  3    which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive
G21 1070 11    talents, all primed to catch some revelation of the
G21 1080  9    emerging new age. The show was colorful, indeed, exuberant,
G21 1090  6    but the press for all its assiduity could detect no
G21 1100  4    note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.
G21 1110  1       Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why
G21 1110 10    there was no clue. And I select this sentence as its
G21 1120  8    pertinent summation: "In essence the drama of his (Eisenhower's)
G21 1130  6    Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation
G21 1140  7    turned conservative and struggling- thus far with but
G21 1150  3    limited and precarious success- to give effective voice
G21 1160  1    and force to that conservatism".
G21 1160  6       I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing
G21 1170  6    struggle, with its limited and precarious success,
G21 1180  2    toward conservatism. It has moved on various levels,
G21 1180 10    it has been clamorous and confused. Obviously there
G21 1190  7    has been no agreement on what American conservatism
G21 1200  4    is, or rather, what it should be. For it was neglected,
G21 1210  3    not to say nascent, when the struggle began. I saw
G21 1210 13    a piece the other day assailing William Buckley, author
G21 1220  9    of MAN AND GOD AT YALE and publisher of the National
G21 1230  9    Review, as no conservative at all, but an old liberal.
G21 1240  7    I would agree with this view. But I'm not here to define
G21 1250  6    conservatism.
G21 1250  7       What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations
G21 1260  7    of the struggle- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition-
G21 1270  4    to see if we can predict its future course.
G21 1280  1       One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the
G21 1280 11    basis of the last election, I suppose, is that we,
G21 1290  9    the majority, were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism.
G21 1300  4    Though, to be sure, we gave Kennedy no very positive
G21 1310  4    approval in the margin of his preferment.
G21 1320  1       This is, however, symptomatic of our national malaise.
G21 1320  9    But before I try to diagnose it, I would offer other
G21 1330  9    evidence. I will mention two volumes of specific comment
G21 1340  5    on this malaise that appeared last year. The earlier
G21 1350  3    of them was an unofficial enterprise, sponsored by
G21 1350 11    Life magazine, under the title of the National purpose.
G21 1360  9    The contributors to this testament were all well-known:
G21 1380  8    a former Democratic candidate for President, a New
G21 1390  6    Deal poet, the magazine's chief editorial writer, two
G21 1400  4    newspaper columnists, head of a national broadcasting
G21 1410  1    company, a popular Protestant evangelist, etc. What
G21 1410  8    I want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals,
G21 1420 13    or modified liberals, with perhaps one exception. I
G21 1430  6    suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal.
G21 1440  6    And I would further note that they all- with one exception
G21 1450  6    again- sang in one key or another the same song. Its
G21 1460  2    refrain was: "Let us return to the individualistic
G21 1460 10    democracy of our forefathers for our salvation".
G21 1470  7       Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about
G21 1480  5    this return. Others invoked technology and common sense.
G21 1490  4    Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our
G21 1500  3    having "outlived most of what we used to regard as
G21 1500 13    the program of our national purposes".
G21 1510  5       But the most notable thing about the incantation
G21 1520  3    of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth
G21 1530  1    of socialism was conspicuously absent.
G21 1530  6       The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's
G21 1540  7    Commission on National Goals, titled GOALS FOR AMERICANS.
G21 1550  6    They, perhaps, gave the pitch of their position in
G21 1560  5    the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested
G21 1570  2    that the Commission be administered by the American
G21 1570 10    Assembly of Columbia University, because it was non-partisan.
G21 1580  9    The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of
G21 1590  8    what I would call the unconscious liberal, but not
G21 1600  5    unconscious enough, to invoke the now taboo symbolism
G21 1610  3    of socialism. And here again we hear the same refrain
G21 1620  1    mentioned above: "The paramount goal of the United
G21 1620  9    States ... set long ago ... was to guard the rights
G21 1630 11    of the individual ... ensure his development ... enlarge
G21 1640  5    his opportunity". This group is secularist and their
G21 1650  3    program tends to be technological.
G21 1650  8       But it is the need to undertake these testaments
G21 1660  7    that I would submit here as symptom of the common man's
G21 1670  6    malaise. And let me add Murray's new book as another
G21 1680  4    symptom of it, particularly so in view of the attention
G21 1690  1    TIME magazine gave it when it came out recently. Father
G21 1690 11    Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence,
G21 1700  8    too, though I may add, with considerably more historical
G21 1710  6    perception.
G21 1710  7       I will reserve discussion of it for a moment, however,
G21 1720  8    to return to President Kennedy. As symptomatic of the
G21 1730  5    common man's malaise, he is most significant: a liberal
G21 1740  3    and a Catholic, elected by the skin of his teeth. Does
G21 1750  2    that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy, not
G21 1750 12    to say confused, state of the public mind?
G21 1760  6       What is the common man's complaint? Let's take a
G21 1770  5    panoramic look back over the course we have come. Has
G21 1780  4    not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism
G21 1790  1    up until the turning back under Eisenhower? And the
G21 1790 10    basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual
G21 1800  7    rather than economic. Ralph Gabriel gave it the name
G21 1810  6    of Protestant philosophy of Progress. But there's a
G21 1820  3    subjective side to that utopian outlook.
