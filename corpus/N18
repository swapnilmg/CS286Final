N18 0010  1       Too many people think that the primary purpose of
N18 0010 10    a higher education is to help you make a living; this
N18 0020  9    is not so, for education offers all kinds of dividends,
N18 0030  5    including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes
N18 0040  2    while you are having an affair with his wife. If it
N18 0040 13    were not for an old professor who made me read the
N18 0050 11    classics I would have been stymied on what to do, and
N18 0060  8    now I understand why they are classics; those who wrote
N18 0070  4    them knew people and what made people tick.
N18 0080  1       I worked for my Uncle (an Uncle by marriage so you
N18 0080 12    will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest)
N18 0090  8    who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans'
N18 0100  5    Vieux Carre, the old French Quarter. The arrangement
N18 0110  2    I had with him was to work four hours a day. The rest
N18 0120  1    of the time I devoted to painting or to those other
N18 0120 12    activities a young and healthy man just out of college
N18 0130  8    finds interesting.
N18 0130 10       I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient
N18 0140  9    courtyard filled with flowers and plants, blooming
N18 0150  5    everlastingly in the southern sun. I had come to New
N18 0160  4    Orleans two years earlier after graduating college,
N18 0160 11    partly because I loved the city and partly because
N18 0170  9    there was quite a noted art colony there. When my Uncle
N18 0180  7    offered me a part-time job which would take care of
N18 0190  5    my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted.
N18 0200  1       The arrangement turned out to be excellent. I loved
N18 0200 10    the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit
N18 0210 10    of Mardi Gras. I had seen two of them and we would
N18 0220 10    soon be in another city-wide, joyous celebration with
N18 0230  4    romance in the air; and, when you took a walk you never
N18 0240  3    knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were
N18 0240 12    waiting around the next corner. The very faces of the
N18 0250 10    people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure. It
N18 0260  6    was as if they could hardly wait to get into their
N18 0270  3    costumes, cover their faces with masks and go adventuring.
N18 0280  1       My Uncle and I were not too close socially because
N18 0290  1    of the difference in our ages. Sometimes I wondered
N18 0290 10    vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt, by blood,
N18 0300  9    had died some years ago, but neither of us said anything.
N18 0310  5    One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with
N18 0320  3    a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt. They
N18 0320 15    were married over the week-end, though he was easily
N18 0330 10    sixty and she could not have been even thirty. She
N18 0340  7    looked more like twenty-five or six. It was really
N18 0350  4    a May and December combination.
N18 0350  9       My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older
N18 0360  8    than I and it had been a long time since I had seen
N18 0370  6    as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex. There was something
N18 0380  2    about the contour of her face, her smile that was like
N18 0380 13    New Orleans sunshine, the way she held her head, the
N18 0390 10    way she walked- there was scarcely anything she did
N18 0400  6    which did not fascinate me. Her legs were the full,
N18 0410  4    sexy kind, full bodied like a rare wine and just as
N18 0420  1    tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent,
N18 0420  9    the ankle perfect.
N18 0430  1       You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much
N18 0430 12    on her physical aspects but I am an artist, accustomed
N18 0440  9    to studying the physical body. The true artist is like
N18 0450  7    one of those scientists who, from a single bone can
N18 0460  5    reconstruct an animal's entire body. The artist looks
N18 0470  1    at an ankle, a calf, a bosom and, in his mind's eye,
N18 0470 13    the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really
N18 0480 10    is. And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle
N18 0490  7    brought her into his antique store.
N18 0500  1       That she impressed me instantly was obvious; I was
N18 0500 10    aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted
N18 0510  8    them. I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to
N18 0520  6    her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks. True, she
N18 0530  2    was my Aunt, married to an Uncle related to me only
N18 0530 13    by marriage, but why she had married a man twice her
N18 0540 10    age, and more, perhaps, I did not know or much care.
N18 0550  7       She was standing with her back to the glass door.
N18 0560  4    Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light
N18 0560 13    I could see the outlines of her body, a body that an
N18 0570 12    artist or anyone else would have admired. As it is
N18 0580  8    in so many affairs of the heart, a man and a woman
N18 0590  5    meet and something clicks. Something clicked in this
N18 0600  1    instance, but I treated her circumspectly and I felt
N18 0600 10    that she knew it, for we both kept our distance.
N18 0610  8       When she appeared at the store to help out for a
N18 0620  6    few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious
N18 0630  1    lest my Uncle notice it. And then I became aware that
N18 0630 12    she, too, glanced at me surreptitiously. I felt that
N18 0640  8    her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter
N18 0650  7    and I a nude model. I dismissed these feelings as wishful
N18 0660  3    thinking but I could not get it out of my head that
N18 0670  1    we had a strong physical attraction for one another
N18 0670 10    and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship.
N18 0680  9    When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered
N18 0690  6    message of "Me, too". You have probably experienced
N18 0700  2    this. It is nothing you can put your fingers on but
N18 0710  1    the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity.
N18 0710 11       Why she married him I do not know. I myself was
N18 0720 11    fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw
N18 0730  7    in him was a mystery to me. He already had that slow
N18 0740  4    pace that comes over the elderly, while she herself
N18 0740 13    had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of
N18 0750 11    living. Perhaps, with my Uncle, she found a measure
N18 0760  7    of economic security that she needed; or maybe she
N18 0770  4    liked men old enough to be her father; some women with
N18 0780  1    father fixations do.
N18 0780  4       For several weeks we eyed one another almost like
N18 0790  3    sparring partners, and then one day Uncle was slightly
N18 0790 12    indisposed and stayed home; his bride opened the store.
N18 0800  9    I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and
N18 0810 10    told me of my Uncle's indisposition. Even as she was
N18 0820  5    telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush
N18 0830  2    that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks,
N18 0830 12    and subconsciously I realized that when she entered
N18 0840  8    the store she did not switch on the lights. The cavernous
N18 0850  8    depth, cluttered with antiques, echoed to her hard
N18 0860  5    heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear
N18 0870  2    and took the seat at his desk. She placed her palms,
N18 0870 13    fingers outspread, on the desk in an odd gesture as
N18 0880 10    if to say, "Now, what next"?
N18 0890  1       I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told
N18 0890 13    me the time was opportune. There was little likelihood
N18 0900  9    of any customers walking in at that hour. I was standing
N18 0910  9    beside her, watching the outspread palms and wondering
N18 0920  4    about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which
N18 0930  3    he sometimes napped.
N18 0930  6       I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly
N18 0940  4    she jumped up, and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like
N18 0950  4    crush. Her mouth, which had been so much in my thoughts,
N18 0960  1    was warm and moist and tender. I heard her murmur,
N18 0960 11    "We'd better lock the door".
N18 0970  4       It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely
N18 0980  1    and return to the rear and its couch.
N18 0980  9       When we opened the door again for business and switched
N18 0990  7    on the lights she said:
N18 1000  1       "He will not always be indisposed".
N18 1000  7       "I know. I was thinking about that. How will we
N18 1010  6    work it out"?
N18 1010  9       "I don't know", she said. "You're the man. You figure
N18 1020  9    it out. I've noticed the way you've been looking at
N18 1030  8    me ever since we met".
N18 1040  1       "I guess we both felt it". I said.
N18 1040  9       "I guess so", she said.
N18 1050  3       "But now what"?
N18 1050  6       Even as I said it I realized that an education can
N18 1060  6    be invaluable.
N18 1060  8       "I know what we can do", I said. "Tell him I made
N18 1070 10    a pass at you".
N18 1080  1       She raised a protesting hand with a startled air.
N18 1080  9       "What are you trying to do? Get thrown out? If I
N18 1090 10    even hint at it do you think it will matter that you
N18 1100  6    are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew"?
N18 1110  1       "I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think
N18 1120  1    I will. I think I have a way so we can carry on without
N18 1120 15    his suspecting us".
N18 1130  2       "By telling him you are making passes at me"? she
N18 1140  2    said incredulously.
N18 1140  4       "When I was in college", I grinned, "I remember
N18 1150  4    a poem I had to read in my lit class. I don't even
N18 1160  2    remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th
N18 1160 13    or 16th century poets. In those days poems often told
N18 1170  8    a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to
N18 1180  6    tell; and now I think we can use the knowledge they
N18 1190  2    passed on to us. Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially.
N18 1200  1    A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and
N18 1200 12    masks, and having a ball. There will be romance and
N18 1210  8    flirtation. If you tell him I made a pass at you he
N18 1220  7    might think you misunderstood something I said or did,
N18 1230  3    so instead of just telling him I made a pass, say I
N18 1230 15    tried to date you and that you agreed so you could
N18 1240 10    prove to him what a louse I really am. We made a rendezvous
N18 1250  8    tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain.
N18 1260  4    And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest
N18 1270  4    that he keep the date instead. You are both the same
N18 1270 15    size. He could use your clothes for a costume and a
N18 1280 11    heavy veil for a mask. When I show up he will know
N18 1290  8    you are a good wife to have told him about it".
N18 1300  3       "But you"- she began.
N18 1300  7       "Don't worry about me. It will turn out all right".
N18 1310 10       "I don't understand", she insisted. "Are you trying
N18 1320  6    to cut your throat"?
N18 1330  1       "No", I chuckled, "I'm just beginning to collect
N18 1330  9    dividends on my investment in education".
N18 1340  6       As we expected, on the following day my Uncle was
N18 1350  7    completely recovered and opened the store as usual
N18 1360  3    at 10 in the morning. I felt that he looked at me coldly
N18 1370  1    and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his
N18 1370 10    attitude towards me should be, but he did not say one
N18 1380 10    word which might indicate that he had been told of
N18 1390  6    advances to his wife.
N18 1390 10       I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was
N18 1400  7    no different from other days. I heard subsequently
N18 1410  1    that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant
N18 1410 12    in the French Quarter after which he went home to get
N18 1420 11    into his costume to keep the date. Shortly before nine
N18 1430  8    I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and
N18 1440  5    parked the car in shadows far enough away from the
N18 1450  2    rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner
N18 1450 11    in clear view. A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's
N18 1460  9    car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to
N18 1470  6    the corner. I must say the figure was well made up.
N18 1480  4    If it were not that I knew who it was I could have
N18 1480 17    mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit
N18 1490 11    him. In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though
N18 1500  6    there had been no indication of rain. I suspected why
N18 1510  4    he brought it along.
N18 1510  8       In the half darkness I approached cautiously, making
N18 1520  4    sure he did not see me. He was looking out on the dark
N18 1530  5    waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without
N18 1540  1    wasting words I smacked him hard across the face.
N18 1540 10       "You cheap bitch"! I exclaimed. "You cheap, no good,
N18 1550  8    two-timing bitch! You get a good, loyal husband- smack!-
N18 1560  8    and you fall for a pass by his own nephew! You should-
N18 1570  7    smack!- be ashamed of yourself.
