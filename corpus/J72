J72 0010  1    Two metabolites (I and II) of p-aminobenzoic acid
J72 0010 10    (PABA) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation
J72 0020  8    of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized
J72 0030  4    from PABA. The 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated
J72 0040  3    directly into metabolite II (as shown with both ring-labeled
J72 0050  4    and carboxy-labeled **f). Thirty-five of the 36 carbon
J72 0060  2    atoms arise from PABA. All 28 carbons of metabolite
J72 0060 11    I (a product of mild acid hydrolysis of II) arise
J72 0070 10    from PABA. Metabolite I isolated from the medium,
J72 0080  7    however, showed a lower specific activity, which indicates
J72 0090  4    endogenous synthesis of this metabolite.
J72 0100  1       Vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite I destroyed
J72 0100  8    the biological activity of the compound and liberated
J72 0110  8    two aryl amines. Fragment A has been obtained in crystalline
J72 0120  8    form as a dioxalate salt and free base. Preliminary
J72 0130  5    evidence tentatively indicates that the molecule (metabolite
J72 0140  3    I) is cleaved at a secondary amide bond. (N. H. Sloane;
J72 0150  3    chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation
J72 0160  1    of K.G. Untch.)
J72 0160  4    _STUDIES ON ESTERASES_
J72 0160  7       - Research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued.
J72 0170  8    One of the most interesting findings was the extreme
J72 0180  5    sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions.
J72 0190  4    The inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations
J72 0200  1    of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological
J72 0200 10    effect of rare earth salts. Various metal ions have
J72 0210  9    been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation
J72 0220  4    by urea and guanidine. The effects can be related to
J72 0230  5    the structure of this -SH enzyme. The non-identity
J72 0240  1    of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established.
J72 0250  1    Furthermore, the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied
J72 0250  8    in mammalian sera, and it was found that it is hydrolyzed
J72 0260 10    by albumin (or a factor attached to it) in addition
J72 0270  5    to arylesterase. Selective inhibitors can distinguish
J72 0280  2    the two activities. Investigations on the acceleration
J72 0280  9    of human plasma cholinesterase were carried further.

J72 0310  1    _BIOPHYSICAL STUDIES ON MODIFIED FIBROUS PROTEINS_
J72 0310  4       - Electron-microscopical and physical-chemical methods
J72 0320  2    were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured
J72 0330  1    collagen and ribonucleic acid. (R. V. Rice)
J72 0330  8       A method was devised for extracting and purifying
J72 0340  7    soluble earthworm collagen (EWC). It was observed
J72 0350  5    that EWC macromolecules are the same diameter (15A)
J72 0360  4    but much longer (up to several microns) than vertebrate
J72 0370  2    tropocollagen. This unusual collagen also was shown
J72 0370  9    to undergo a reversible thermal phase transformation.

J72 0390  3    _STUDIES ON PEPTIDES AND PEPTIDASES_
J72 0390  8       - This investigation involved several aspects. Substance
J72 0400  5    Z, an active urinary peptide, was purified by extraction
J72 0410  6    in organic solvents and repeated column chromatography;
J72 0420  3    high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography
J72 0430  1    were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological
J72 0440  1    effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in
J72 0440 10    vivo on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment
J72 0460  8    required for registering respiration and for recording
J72 0470  5    the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions
J72 0480  4    was developed by the Instruments Section (Victor Jackman,
J72 0490  3    W. C. Barnes, J. F. Reiss); and enzymes which terminate
J72 0500  3    the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps
J72 0510  1    Substance Z were studied. Experiments are in progress
J72 0510  9    to develop ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques
J72 0520  4    for assaying these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity
J72 0530  6    to metal ions. (E. G. Erdo^s, C. D. Mackey, A. G. Renfrew,
J72 0540  7    W. B. Severs, E. M. Sloane)
J72 0550  4    _SEED PROTEINS_
J72 0550  6       - In a physiochemical study of seed proteins, the
J72 0560  5    globulins of the Brazil nut have been investigated.
J72 0570  1    In addition to the known principal globulin, excelsin,
J72 0570  9    three other ultracentrifugally distinct components
J72 0580  5    have been observed. A water-soluble protein of quite
J72 0590  6    low molecular weight (ca. 10,000) has also been found
J72 0600  4    in this system and partly characterized. (E. F. Casassa,

J72 0620  1    _THEORY OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUIDS_
J72 0620  6       - On the basis of a differentiability assumption
J72 0630  4    in function space, it is possible to prove that, for
J72 0640  3    materials having the property that the stress is given
J72 0640 12    by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients,
J72 0650 10    the classical theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity
J72 0660  5    is valid when the deformation has been infinitesimal
J72 0670  4    for all times in the past. By strengthening the differentiability
J72 0680  3    assumption, it has been possible to derive second and
J72 0690  2    higher order theories of viscoelasticity. In the second-order
J72 0700  1    theory, one of the normal stress differences can be
J72 0700 10    calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function.

J72 0730  1    _VISCOELASTIC MEASUREMENTS_
J72 0730  3       - An extensive series of measurements was made on
J72 0740  5    a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum instrument
J72 0750  2    using forced sinusoidal oscillation, free vibration,
J72 0750  8    and creep measurements over the temperature range of
J72 0760  8    **f to 80`C. As many as seven decades of the time
J72 0770  9    scale were thus covered isothermally. The simple time-temperature
J72 0780  5    equivalence valid for many amorphous systems did not
J72 0790  4    hold here. It was possible, however, to decompose the
J72 0800  2    compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component
J72 0800 11    and two viscoelastic mechanisms, each compatible with
J72 0810  6    the Boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent
J72 0820  6    set of time-temperature equivalence factors. (Hershel

J72 0840  1    #GEOCHEMISTRY#
J72 0850  1    _TRACE ELEMENTS IN TEKTITES, METEORITES, AND RELATED
J72 0850  1    MATERIALS_
J72 0850  1       - The results of microanalysis of tektites (natural
J72 0860  1    glasses of unknown origin) for gallium and germanium
J72 0860  9    have shown that these glasses are probably produced
J72 0870  6    from terrestrial (or less likely from lunar) matter
J72 0880  4    by impact of a celestial body. The gallium/germanium
J72 0890  1    ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous, metamorphic,
J72 0890 10    or sedimentary matter as a result of selective volatilization
J72 0900  8    of the components of the tektite. Gallium oxide is
J72 0910  7    less volatile than silica (the main constituent of
J72 0920  4    tektites) and germanium oxide is more volatile. Australites
J72 0930  1    (tektites from Australia) give the appearance of a
J72 0930  9    second melting. In conformity with this conclusion
J72 0940  7    a higher trace gallium content was found in the portion
J72 0950  7    (flange) that has undergone a second melting. The silicate
J72 0960  4    fractions of stony meteorites show gallium/germanium
J72 0970  1    ratios similar to those of tektites because they too
J72 0970 10    have undergone melting at some point in their histories.
J72 0980  8       Libyan Desert silica-glass, another natural glass,
J72 0990  4    is composed of nearly pure silica and has the same
J72 1000  5    trace germanium content as sands in the area. The gallium
J72 1010  1    content, however, has been enhanced five-fold. This
J72 1010  9    glass is probably formed from Libyan Desert sands by
J72 1020  7    comet or stony-meteorite impact.
J72 1030  2       Nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy
J72 1040  1    to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may
J72 1040  8    nevertheless melt only small quantities of material.
J72 1050  5    Most of the impact energy is spent in crushing and
J72 1060  4    fragmentation. When rapid quenching follows melting,
J72 1070  1    impact glasses may result. These always contain metallic
J72 1070  9    inclusions. Impact glasses not containing elemental
J72 1080  6    nickel-iron may have been produced by stony meteorites
J72 1090  5    or comets. No meteorites have ever been recovered from
J72 1100  3    paleoexplosion craters, and recent craters containing
J72 1110  1    impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites
J72 1110 10    with the exception of Aouelloul crater, Adrar, Western
J72 1120  6    Sahara Desert. This crater contains impact glass with
J72 1130  6    no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic material has
J72 1140  3    been recovered. (A. J. Cohen, John Anania)
J72 1150  1    #INORGANIC CHEMISTRY#
J72 1150  3    Preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished
J72 1160  2    by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with
J72 1160 12    a ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol.
J72 1170 10    By applying this general principle, a great number
J72 1180  5    of complex compounds of osmium, ruthenium, iridium,
J72 1190  2    and rhenium, with triphenylphosphine, triphenylarsine,
J72 1195  1    and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory
J72 1200  7    during the past few years. (Lauri Vaska, E. M. Sloane,
J72 1210  7    J. W. DiLuzio) In the absence of direct evidence to
J72 1220  8    the contrary, decomposition of solvent alcohol and
J72 1230  4    coordination of its fragments to the metal were not
J72 1240  2    considered, following the above heretofore-accepted
J72 1240  8    assumption in preparative coordination chemistry. Recent
J72 1250  5    work with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents,
J72 1260  5    however, has given evidence that metal-hydrido and
J72 1270  2    -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction
J72 1280  1    with alcohol in some of these systems. Some of the
J72 1280 11    previously reported compounds have thus been reformulated
J72 1290  6    and a series of new hydrido and carbonyl compounds
J72 1300  3    discovered, the more representative examples being
J72 1310  1    **f, **f, **f, **f and **f (**f).
J72 1310  8       The coordination complexes formed by transition
J72 1320  4    metals with primary and secondary phosphines and arsines
J72 1330  2    are being investigated (R. G. Hayter). Particular interest
J72 1340  1    is directed towards the condensation of these ligands
J72 1340  9    with metal halides to form substituted phosphide or
J72 1350  7    arside complexes. During the past year, these ligands
J72 1360  5    have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes
J72 1370  1    of nickel (II) and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged
J72 1380  1    complexes of palladium (II) (see figure), as well
J72 1380  9    as new compounds of the well-known type **f. The structures,
J72 1390  9    properties, and reactions of these compounds are being
J72 1400  6    studied.
J72 1400  7       In another study chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides
J72 1410  5    and related species, prepared homogeneously by high-temperature
J72 1420  5    hydrolysis, are being characterized and investigated
J72 1430  3    spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view to
J72 1440  2    identification and semiquantitative estimation of the
J72 1440  8    phases formed under varying preparative conditions.

J72 1470  1    _ELASTICITY OF MACROMOLECULAR NETWORKS_
J72 1470  4       - The theory of elasticity of Gaussian networks
J72 1480  3    has been developed on a more general basis and the
J72 1490  1    equations of state relating variables of pressure,
J72 1490  8    volume, temperature, stress and strain have been precisely
J72 1500  7    formulated. Simple elongation has been treated in detail.
J72 1510  6    The various stress-temperature coefficients for constancy
J72 1520  3    of volume and strain, constancy of pressure and strain,
J72 1530  1    and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated.
J72 1530 10    The dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously
J72 1540  7    developed anisotropy of compressibility have been related
J72 1550  6    to the elongation. In continuation of these theoretical
J72 1560  4    studies, a more precise elucidation of the effects
J72 1570  3    of imperfections in network structure is sought. (P.

J72 1590  1    _CHAIN CONFORMATIONS OF POLYMERIC CHAINS_
J72 1590  1       - Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions
J72 1600  1    of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been
J72 1600 10    extended to include more general types of chains. The
J72 1610  7    mean-square end-to-end distance of the polyisobutylene
J72 1620  4    chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with
J72 1630  2    values deduced from viscosity data. These studies are
J72 1630 10    being extended to different polymers to increase our
J72 1640  8    knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain
J72 1650  6    bonds. (C. A. J. Hoeve, A. A. Blumberg)
J72 1670  1    _CRYSTALLIZATION IN POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS_
J72 1670  3       - The crystallization of copolymers comprising **f
J72 1670  9    units interspersed with a minor percentage of **f is
J72 1680  8    limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic
J72 1690  4    of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of
J72 1700  4    the latter. Only uninterrupted sequences of the former
J72 1710  1    are eligible for formation of crystallites. Limitations
J72 1710  8    on the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability
J72 1720  7    of the comparatively short crystallites which can be
J72 1730  5    formed, and this is reflected in a broadening of the
J72 1740  3    melting range. (Robert Chiang, J. B. Jackson, P. J.
J72 1750  2    Flory) Carefully executed melting studies on this system
J72 1750 10    (M. J. Richardson) permit quantitative estimation of
J72 1760  7    the instability engendered by reduced crystallite length.
J72 1770  6    The complex morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers
J72 1780  3    is necessarily dependent on the same factor. Hence,
J72 1790  2    the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations
J72 1800  1    in the latter field.
J72 1800  5    _CONTRACTION OF MUSCLE_
J72 1800  8       - Glycerinated muscle, in the presence of the physiological
J72 1810  8    agent. (ATP) responsible for delivering energy to
J72 1820  5    the mechanochemically active proteins of muscle, has
J72 1830  4    been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly
J72 1830 13    sensitive both to temperature and to solvent composition
J72 1840  8    in mixtures of alcohols and water. Experiments carried
J72 1850  6    out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment
J72 1860  6    of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction
J72 1870  4    and its completion are confined to an interval of several
J72 1880  2    degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of
J72 1880 10    only several per cent. The contraction therefore partakes
J72 1890  7    of the character of a phase transition. While ATP
J72 1900  6    appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction,
J72 1910  4    its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the
J72 1920  3    muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for
J72 1920 12    contraction. (C. A. J. Hoeve, P. J. Flory)
J72 1940  1    _ANIONIC POLYMERIZATION_
J72 1940  3       - One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization
J72 1940 11    techniques is the synthesis of polymers of extremely
J72 1950  8    narrow molecular weight distribution. A simple process
J72 1960  5    for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene
J72 1970  2    of predictable molecular weight has been developed.
J72 1980  1    The preparation of such products is not new, but the
J72 1980 11    systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have
J72 1990  5    commanded considerable experimental skill and starting
J72 2000  4    materials of a high purity. In the new process impurities
J72 2010  2    present in the solvent (benzene), the monomer, and
J72 2010 10    in the reaction system which would cause deactivation
J72 2020  7    of propagation centers, are rendered inactive prior
J72 2030  5    to polymerization by gradual addition of initiator,
J72 2040  2    a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium,
J72 2040 11    at a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth.
J72 2050  9    Upon completion of the purging step, additional initiator
J72 2060  7    appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample
J72 2070  5    desired is added, and the system is then warmed to
J72 2080  2    the polymerization temperature, at which the reaction
J72 2080  9    is allowed to go to completion. The predictability
J72 2090  7    of the molecular weights was found to be within 10%
J72 2100  6    for the polymers prepared, with **f ratios less than
J72 2110  2    1.1.
J72 2110  3       Contrary to observations with ethers, no apparent
J72 2120  1    change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place
J72 2120 11    over considerable periods of time in benzene as solvent.
