J78 0010  1       High-gain, photoelectronic image intensification
J78 0010  6    is applied under conditions of low incident light levels
J78 0020  7    whenever the integration time required by a sensor
J78 0030  5    or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability.
J78 0040  2    Examples of such situations are (aerial) night reconnaissance,
J78 0050  1    the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues,
J78 0060  1    special radiography in medical or industrial applications,
J78 0060  8    track recording of high energy particles, etc.
J78 0070  6       High-gain photoelectronic image intensification
J78 0080  3    may be achieved by several methods; some of these are
J78 0090  3    listed below:
J78 0090  5    _(A)_
J78 0090  6       Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems,
J78 0100  3    _(B)_
J78 0100  4       Channel-type, secondary emission image intensifier,
J78 0110  1    _(C)_
J78 0110  2       Image intensifier based upon the "multipactor" principle,
J78 0120  2    _(D)_
J78 0120  3       Transmission secondary electron multiplication image
J78 0130  2    intensifiers (TSEM tubes),
J78 0130  5    _(E)_
J78 0130  6       Cascading of single stages, enclosed in one common
J78 0140  6    envelope.
J78 0140  7       Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems
J78 0150  5    is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the
J78 0160  3    obtainable gain quite severely. Channel-type image
J78 0160 10    intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values;
J78 0170  8    suffer, however, from an inherently low resolution.
J78 0180  6    Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle
J78 0190  4    appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution
J78 0200  2    is concerned. However, the unavoidable low-duty cycle
J78 0200 10    restricts the effective gain. TSEM tubes have been
J78 0210  8    constructed showing high gain and resolution. However,
J78 0220  6    electrostatic focus, important for many applications,
J78 0230  4    has not been realized for these devices. Resolution
J78 0240  1    limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated
J78 0240  8    due to chromatic aberrations. Furthermore, the thin
J78 0250  6    film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation
J78 0260  6    wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated.
J78 0270  2       Cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope
J78 0280  1    have been constructed with high gain and high resolution.
J78 0280 10    These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron
J78 0290 11    optical system and in the design of the coupling members.
J78 0300  9    The electron optical system may be either a magnetic
J78 0310  6    or electrostatic one. The magnification may be smaller,
J78 0320  4    equal, or larger than unity.
J78 0320  9       An electrostatic system suffers generally from image
J78 0330  6    plane curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral
J78 0340  4    image region if a flat viewing screen (or interstage
J78 0350  1    coupler) is utilized, while a magnetic system requires
J78 0350  9    accurate adjustment of the solenoid, which is heavy
J78 0360  8    and bulky. As it will be discussed later, peripheral
J78 0370  3    defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber
J78 0380  3    couplers. It should be noted, however, that the paraxial
J78 0390  1    resolution is quite similar for both electron optical
J78 0390  9    systems.
J78 0400  1       It is felt that fiber-coupled double- (and multi-)
J78 0400 11    stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance
J78 0410  5    in the future. Therefore, we shall consider in this
J78 0420  5    paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities
J78 0430  1    of such tubes. The luminous efficiency and resolution
J78 0430  9    of single stages, fiber couplers, and finally of the
J78 0440  8    composite tube will be computed.
J78 0450  2       It will be shown theoretically that the high image
J78 0460  1    intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact
J78 0460  9    photography permits the utilization of extremely low
J78 0470  6    incident light levels. The effect of device and quantum
J78 0480  5    noise, associated with such low input levels, will
J78 0490  2    be described.
J78 0490  4       After these theoretical considerations, constructional
J78 0500  1    details of a fiber-coupled, double-stage X-ray image
J78 0510  1    intensifier will be discussed. Measured performance
J78 0510  7    characteristics for this experimental tube will be
J78 0520  7    listed.
J78 0520  8       The conclusion shall be reached that fiber-coupled,
J78 0530  6    double-stage tubes represent a sensible and practical
J78 0540  3    approach to high-gain image intensification.
J78 0540  9    #BASIC DESIGN OF A FIBER-COUPLED, DOUBLE-STAGE IMAGE
J78 0550  9    INTENSIFIER#
J78 0550 10    The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical
J78 0560  9    discussion shall be described now. The electron optical
J78 0570  7    system (see fig. 14-1) is based in principle on the
J78 0580  6    focusing action of concentric spherical cathode and
J78 0590  2    anode surfaces. The inner [anode] sphere is pierced,
J78 0590 10    elongated into a cup, and terminated by the phosphor
J78 0600  9    screen. The photoelectrons emitted from a circular
J78 0610  5    segment of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive
J78 0620  4    lens action of the two concentric spheres, pass through
J78 0630  1    the [negative] lens formed by the anode aperture, and
J78 0630 10    impinge upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen.
J78 0640  6    The cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment
J78 0650  4    of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential.
J78 0660  3    The anode potential codetermines the gain, G, and
J78 0670  2    magnification, M, of the stage.
J78 0670  7       Both the photocathode and the image plane of such
J78 0680  7    an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen
J78 0690  4    from the anode aperture. The field-flattening property
J78 0700  1    of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate
J78 0700 11    the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat
J78 0710  8    phosphor-screen or coupling member. For the same reason,
J78 0720  7    the output fiber plate is planoconcave, its exposed
J78 0740  3    flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent
J78 0750  1    record is desired. As it will be shown later, the
J78 0750 11    field-flattening
J78 0760  1    properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler
J78 0760  9    comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design.
J78 0770  8       The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces
J78 0780  5    are deposited on the fiber plate substrates. The photocathode
J78 0790  3    sensitivities S, phosphor efficiencies P, and anode
J78 0800  4    potentials V of the individual stages shall be distinguished
J78 0810  3    by means of subscripts I and II in the text, where
J78 0820  2    required. Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification.
J78 0830  1    #THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF FLUX GAIN#
J78 0840  1    _FLUX GAIN OF A SINGLE STAGE_
J78 0840  2       The luminous gain of a single stage with **f (flux
J78 0840 12    gain) is, to a first approximation, given by the product
J78 0850  9    of the photocathode sensitivity S (amp/lumen), the
J78 0860  5    anode potential V (volts), and the phosphor conversion
J78 0870  5    efficiency P (lumen-watt). In general, P is a function
J78 0880  6    of V and the current density, but it shall here be
J78 0890  6    assumed as a constant.
J78 0890 10       The luminous efficiency **f of a photocathode depends
J78 0900  7    on the maximum radiant sensitivity **f and on the spectral
J78 0910  7    distribution of the incident light **f by the relation:
J78 0920  5    **f where **f ... normalized radiant photocathode sensitivity.
J78 0930  2    **f ... standard visibility function. The luminous
J78 0930  9    flux gain of a single stage is given by: **f If the
J78 0940 12    input light distribution falls beyond the visible range,
J78 0950  6    **f as expected, since **f. Such cases are not considered
J78 0960  5    here.
J78 0960  6    _EFFICIENCY OF FIBER COUPLERS_
J78 0970  1       The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on
J78 0970  8    four factors:
J78 0980  1    _(A)_
J78 0980  1       numerical aperture (N.A.).
J78 0980  4    _(B)_
J78 0980  5       end (Fresnel reflection) losses (R).
J78 1000  1    _(C)_
J78 1000  2       internal losses (I.L.).
J78 1010  1    _(D)_
J78 1010  1       packing efficiency (F.R.). The numerical aperture
J78 1010  7    of the fibers is given by: **f where **f.
J78 1020  7       The angle **f is measured in the medium of index
J78 1030  5    **f. Settled phosphors, as generally used in image
J78 1040  1    intensifiers, have low optical contact with the substrate
J78 1040  9    surface, hence **f shall be assumed. The numerical
J78 1050  8    aperture should be in general close to unity. This
J78 1060  5    condition can be satisfied, e.g., with **f and **f
J78 1070  3    or equivalent glass combinations.
J78 1070  7       A sufficiently good approximation for determining
J78 1080  4    the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the
J78 1100  4    angle independent Fresnel formula: **f For phosphor
J78 1110  1    to fiber and fiber to air surfaces, and assuming **f,
J78 1110 11    we obtain **f percent. This value may be reduced to
J78 1120  9    4.6 percent by means of a (very thin) glass layer of
J78 1130  5    index 1.5. Hence, the **f factor for the output fiber
J78 1140  2    coupler is **f.
J78 1140  5       As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces
J78 1150  2    of the SbCs-type lies around 2, the Fresnel losses
J78 1160  1    at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent
J78 1160 10    and the **f factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95.
J78 1170  9    It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will
J78 1180  5    reduce end reflection losses even further.
J78 1190  1       The internal losses are due to absorption and the
J78 1190 10    small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal
J78 1200  8    reflections due to deviations from the prescribed,
J78 1210  5    cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections
J78 1220  2    of the core-jacket interface. These losses depend on
J78 1230  2    fiber diameter and length, absorption coefficient,
J78 1230  8    the mean value of the loss per internal reflection
J78 1240  6    and last but not least, on the angular distribution
J78 1250  2    of the incident light. Explicit expressions (integral
J78 1260  1    averages) are given in the literature. Lacking reliable
J78 1260  9    data for some of the variables, we are relying on experimental
J78 1270  9    data of about 20 percent internal losses for 1/4-inch
J78 1280  6    long, small (5-10|m) diameter fibers. This relatively
J78 1290  4    high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters
J78 1300  2    increasing the number of internal reflections. Since
J78 1300  9    we are considering here relatively small diameter (1-1.5
J78 1310  8    inches) fiber plates, their average thickness can be
J78 1320  6    kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be
J78 1330  4    assumed as 15 percent (per plate).
J78 1330 10       The packing efficiency, F.R., of fiber plates did
J78 1340  7    not receive much attention in the literature, probably
J78 1350  5    as it is high for the larger fibers generally used,
J78 1360  2    until rather recently. For circular fibers in a closely
J78 1370  1    packed hexagonal array, the packing efficiency is given
J78 1370  9    by: **f where **f, and 0.906 is the ratio of the area
J78 1380 10    of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon. For
J78 1390  4    the small diameter fibers now technically feasible
J78 1400  2    and required for about 100 **f resolution, **f. The
J78 1400 11    cladding thickness is about 0.5|m, hence, **f and
J78 1410  8    **f.
J78 1410  9       Thus, the efficiency |t couplers is given by- **f
J78 1420  9    or approximately 50 percent each.
J78 1430  4       It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace
J78 1440  1    a glass window and a (mica) membrane, in addition to
J78 1440 11    an optical output lens system. The efficiency **f of
J78 1450  8    an **f lens at the magnification **f is: **f Neglecting
J78 1460  5    absorption, the end losses of the coupling membrane
J78 1470  2    and the output window **f would be 6 percent and 8
J78 1470 13    percent. Thus, the combined efficiency of the elements
J78 1480  8    replaced by the two fiber plates (with a combined efficiency
J78 1490  7    of 0.25) is 0.043 or about six times less than that
J78 1500  6    of the two fiber plates.
J78 1510  1    _GAIN OF FIBER COUPLED IMAGE INTENSIFIERS_
J78 1510  4       Including the brightness gain **f due to the **f
J78 1520  4    area demagnification, the overall gain of a fiber coupled
J78 1520 13    double stage image intensifier is: **f It is obvious
J78 1530  9    that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes
J78 1540  6    **f for a given input E (in the case of the second
J78 1550  7    stage, for the first phosphor screen emission) is very
J78 1560  3    important. The same consideration should govern the
J78 1560 10    choice of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching
J78 1570  9    with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor
J78 1580  6    (e.g., photographic emulsion).
J78 1590  1       We have evaluated the "matching integrals" for two
J78 1590  9    types of photocathodes (S-11 and S-20) and three
J78 1600 10    types of light input. The input light distributions
J78 1610  5    considered are P-11 and P-20 phosphor emission and
J78 1620  4    the so-called "night light" (N.L.) as given by H.W.
J78 1630  5    Babcock and J. J. Johnson. The integrals (in @ units)
J78 1640  4    are listed in table 14-I below:
J78 1640 11    #THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF PARAXIAL DEVICE RESOLUTION#
J78 1660  1    _RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS IN A SINGLE STAGE_
J78 1660  5       The resolution limitations for a single stage are
J78 1670  1    given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical
J78 1670 10    system as well as the resolution capabilities of the
J78 1680  8    cathodoluminescent viewing screen.
J78 1690  2       The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic
J78 1690  8    system depend on both the choice of magnification and
J78 1700  9    chromatic aberrations. It has been stated previously
J78 1720  6    that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower
J78 1730  3    resolution than a magnifying system or a system with
J78 1730 12    unity magnification.
J78 1740  2       Furthermore, the chromatic aberrations depend on
J78 1750  2    the chosen high voltage. In general, a high anode voltage
J78 1750 12    reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the
J78 1760  7    obtainable resolution.
J78 1770  1       The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated
J78 1770 10    from Eq. (6) for the 16 possible combinations of S-11
J78 1780 10    and S-20 photocathodes and P-11 and P-20 phosphor
J78 1790  8    screens, for night light and P-20 light input. (The
J78 1800  7    P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly
J78 1810  4    to the light emission of conventional X-ray fluorescent
J78 1820  2    screens). The following efficiencies obtained from
J78 1820  8    JEDEC and RCA specifications were used: **f
J78 1830  7       The following table (14-II) lists the (luminous)
J78 1840  7    gain values computed according to Eq. (6) with **f:
J78 1850  6       The possibility of a space charge blowup of the
J78 1860  4    screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles
J78 1860 11    has been pointed out. It is obvious that such an influence
J78 1870 11    can only be expected in the final stage of an image
J78 1880  9    intensifier at rather high output levels. Space charge
J78 1890  4    influences will also decrease at increased voltages.
J78 1900  2       Electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type
J78 1900  9    have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying
J78 1910  8    electronography. A resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per
J78 1920  9    millimeter appears to be feasible.
J78 1930  1       The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent
J78 1930  7    phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate
J78 1940  6    thickness (with increasing anode voltage), decreases
J78 1950  4    with decreasing porosity (thus the advantage of cathodophoretic
J78 1960  3    phosphor deposition) and might be impaired by the normally
J78 1970  2    used aluminum mirror. Thus, in general, elementary
J78 1970  9    light optical effects, light scatter, and electron
J78 1980  7    scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit.
J78 1990  3    It should be noted that photoluminescence, due to
J78 2000  3    "Bremsstrahlung"
J78 2000  4    generated within the viewing screen by electron impact,
J78 2010  2    appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess
J78 2020  1    of 30 KV are utilized. It has been stated that settled
J78 2020 12    cathodoluminescent phosphor screens may have a limiting
J78 2030  7    resolution of 60 **f at high voltage values of approximately
J78 2040  7    20 KV. For the further discussion, we shall thus assume
J78 2050  5    an electron optical resolution of 80 **f and phosphor
J78 2060  3    screen resolution of 60 **f.
