H22 0040  8    _3._
H22 0040  9       The United States recognizes the desire of India
H22 0050  6    to accumulate, as quickly as possible, a substantial

H22 0070  2    for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the
H22 0070 11    internal markets for this commodity in India. Under
H22 0080  8    this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities
H22 0090  6    will be made in August 1960. At that time consideration
H22 0100  5    will be given to whether in the light of the United
H22 0110  3    States supplies of rice available for Title I disposal,
H22 0120  1    India's production, consumption and stocks of food
H22 0120  8    grains, other imports from the United States and countries
H22 0130  8    friendly to the United States, India's storage capacity,
H22 0140  5    and other related factors, any increase would be possible
H22 0150  5    in the portion of the total rice programmed which is
H22 0160  3    currently planned for procurement during the first

H22 0190  7    by the United States Government that these commodities
H22 0200  5    are in surplus supply and available under Title I
H22 0210  4    of the Act at that time. The United States Government
H22 0220  1    shall have the right to terminate the financing of
H22 0220 10    further sales under this Agreement of any commodity
H22 0230  7    if it determines at any time after June 30, 1961, that
