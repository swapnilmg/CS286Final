K19 0010  1    There was one fact which Rector could not overlook,
K19 0010 10    one truth which he could not deny. As long as there
K19 0020  9    were two human beings working together on the same
K19 0030  4    project, there would be competition and you could no
K19 0040  1    more escape it than you could expect to escape the
K19 0040 11    grave. No matter how devoted a man was, no matter how
K19 0050  9    fully he gave his life to the Lord, he could never
K19 0060  4    extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition
K19 0070  1    as an individual. All of the jobs in the mission might
K19 0070 12    be equal in the eyes of the Lord, but they were certainly
K19 0080 11    not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants. It was
K19 0090  8    only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position
K19 0100  5    in which he could make the decisions.
K19 0110  1       Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition
K19 0110 11    and he knew it, not for a more exalted office in the
K19 0120 11    hierarchy of the church- his ambitions for the bishopry
K19 0130  8    had died very early in his career- but for the one
K19 0140  5    clear victory he had talked about to the colonel. He
K19 0150  1    was not sure how much of this desire was due to his
K19 0150 13    devotion to the church and how much was his own ego,
K19 0170  8    demanding to be satisfied, for the two were intertwined
K19 0180  3    and could not be separated. He wanted desperately to
K19 0190  2    see Kayabashi defeated, the Communists in the village
K19 0190 10    rooted out, the mission standing triumphant, for in
K19 0200  7    the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant,
K19 0210  5    too. But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan,
K19 0220  3    that man's ambition when linked with God would be a
K19 0220 13    driving, indefatigable force for good in the world.
K19 0230  8       He sighed. How foolish it was to try to fathom the
K19 0240 10    truth in an area where only faith would suffice. He
K19 0250  4    would have to work without questioning the motives
K19 0260  1    which made him work and content himself with the thought
K19 0260 11    that the eventual victory, however it was brought about,
K19 0270  8    would be sweet indeed.
K19 0280  1       His first move was to send Hino to the village to
K19 0280 12    spend a few days. His arm had been giving him some
K19 0290  8    trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert
K19 0300  5    to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether
K19 0310  2    Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work
K19 0310 10    in the print shop, using the stiffness in his arm as
K19 0320  9    an excuse. In any event Rector sent him to the local
K19 0330  6    hospital to have it checked, telling him to keep his
K19 0340  3    ears open while he was in the village to see if he
K19 0340 15    could find out what Kayabashi was planning.
K19 0350  6       Hino was elated at the prospect. He was allowed
K19 0360  4    to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and
K19 0370  2    he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko
K19 0370 13    parlor- an excellent place to make contact with the
K19 0380 11    enemy. He left with all the joyous spirit of a child
K19 0390  7    going on a holiday, nodding attentively as Rector gave
K19 0400  4    him his final instructions. He was to get involved
K19 0400 13    in no arguments; he was to try to make no converts;
K19 0410 10    he was simply to listen and report back what he heard.
K19 0420  7       It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it,
K19 0430  5    for Hino, frankly partisan, openly gregarious, would
K19 0440  2    make a poor espionage agent. If he wanted to know anything,
K19 0440 13    he would end up asking about it point-blank, but in
K19 0450 11    this guileless manner he would probably receive more
K19 0460  6    truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection.
K19 0470  5    In all of his experience in the mission field Rector
K19 0480  2    had never seen a convert quite like Hino. From the
K19 0480 12    moment that Hino had first walked into the mission
K19 0490  9    to ask for a job, any job- his qualifications neatly
K19 0500  6    written on a piece of paper in a precise hand- he had
K19 0510  3    been ready to become a Christian. He had already been
K19 0520  1    studying the Bible; he knew the fundamentals, and after
K19 0520 10    studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector,
K19 0530  9    announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was
K19 0540  7    that.
K19 0540  8       Rector had never been able to find out much about
K19 0550  6    Hino's past. Hino talked very little about himself
K19 0560  2    except for the infrequent times when he used a personal
K19 0560 12    illustration in connection with another subject. Putting
K19 0570  7    the pieces of this mosaic together, Rector had the
K19 0580  7    vague outlines of a biography. Hino was the fourth
K19 0590  4    son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast, in
K19 0600  1    Chiba, and divided his life between the land and the
K19 0600 11    sea, supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small
K19 0610  7    rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat.
K19 0620  5    Without exception Hino's brothers turned to either
K19 0630  3    one or both of their father's occupations, but Hino
K19 0630 12    showed a talent for neither and instead spent most
K19 0640  9    of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and
K19 0650  6    proved immensely popular as a storyteller. He had gone
K19 0660  4    into the Japanese navy, had been trained as an officer,
K19 0670  1    had participated in one or two battles- he never went
K19 0670 11    into detail regarding his military experience- and
K19 0680  6    at the age of twenty-five, quite as a bolt out of the
K19 0690  8    blue, he had walked into the mission as if he belonged
K19 0700  3    here and had become a Christian. Rector was often curious;
K19 0710  1    often tempted to ask questions but he never did. If
K19 0710 11    and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences,
K19 0720  8    he would do so unasked.
K19 0730  1       Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from
K19 0730 11    the village bursting with information, ready to impart
K19 0740  7    it with his customary gusto, liberally embellished
K19 0750  3    with his active imagnation. When the telephone rang
K19 0760  2    on the day after Hino went down to the village, Rector
K19 0760 13    had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information
K19 0770 12    too important to wait until his return, for there were
K19 0780  9    few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector's
K19 0790  6    office rarely rang unless it was important. He was
K19 0800  3    surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other
K19 0810  1    end of the line. He was even more startled when he
K19 0810 12    heard what Kayabashi wanted. The oyabun was entertaining
K19 0820  6    a group of dignitaries, the secretary said, businessmen
K19 0830  4    from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi wished
K19 0840  2    to show them the mission. They had never seen one before
K19 0850  1    and had expressed a curiosity about it.
K19 0850  8       "Oh"? Rector said. "I guess it will be all right.
K19 0860  9    When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here"?
K19 0870  7       "This afternoon", the secretary said. "At three
K19 0880  5    o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that
K19 0890  4    time".
K19 0890  5       "All right", Rector said. "I will be expecting them".
K19 0900  4       He was about to hang up the phone, but a note of
K19 0910  4    hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation
K19 0920  1    open. He had something more to say. "I beg to inquire
K19 0920 12    if the back is now safe for travelers", he said.
K19 0930  8       Rector laughed despite himself. "Unless the oyabun
K19 0940  5    has been working on it", he said, then checked himself
K19 0950  4    and added: "You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back
K19 0960  4    road is in very good condition and will be quite safe
K19 0960 15    for his party to use".
K19 0970  5       "Arigato gosaimasu". The secretary sighed with relief
K19 0980  4    and then the telephone clicked in Rector's hand.
K19 0990  2       Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit
K19 0990 11    the mission. For the oyabun to make such a trip was
K19 1000 10    either a sign of great weakness or an indication of
K19 1010  6    equally great confidence, and from all the available
K19 1020  3    information it was probably the latter. Kayabashi must
K19 1030  1    feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make
K19 1030 11    a visit like this, a trip which could be so easily
K19 1040  8    misinterpreted by the people in the village. At the
K19 1050  3    same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would
K19 1050 12    spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity.
K19 1060 11    No, Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for
K19 1070  7    a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to
K19 1080  6    fathom it until they arrived.
K19 1080 11       When he had given the call a few moments thought,
K19 1090  8    he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare
K19 1100  5    tea and sushi for the visitors, using the formal English
K19 1110  4    china and the silver tea service which had been donated
K19 1120  2    to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the
K19 1120 12    grounds. Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side
K19 1130  9    of the lawn. Rector asked him to move it for the time
K19 1140  8    being; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly
K19 1150  4    spotless. A good initial impression would be important
K19 1160  1    now. He went into the print shop, where Fletcher had
K19 1160 11    just finished cleaning the press.
K19 1170  4       "How many pamphlets do we have in stock"? Rector
K19 1180  2    said.
K19 1180  3       "I should say about a hundred thousand", Fletcher
K19 1190  2    said. "Why"?
K19 1190  4       "I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon",
K19 1200  6    Rector said, He explained about the visit and the effect
K19 1210  6    he wished to create, the picture of a very busy mission.
K19 1220  2    He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly, just
K19 1220 11    to display the mission activities in a graphic and
K19 1230  8    impressive manner. Fletcher nodded as he listened to
K19 1240  6    the instructions and said he would arrange the things
K19 1250  3    Rector requested.
K19 1250  5       Rector's next stop was at the schoolroom, where
K19 1260  4    Mavis was monitoring a test. He beckoned to her from
K19 1270  2    the door and she slipped quietly outside. He told her
K19 1270 12    of the visitors and then of his plans. "How many children
K19 1280  9    do you have present today"? he said.
K19 1290  4       She looked back toward the schoolroom. "Fifteen",
K19 1300  2    she said. "No, only fourteen. The little Ito girl had
K19 1310  2    to go home. She has a pretty bad cold".
K19 1310 11       "I would like them to appear very busy today, not
K19 1320  9    busy exactly, but joyous, exuberant, full of life.
K19 1330  4    I want to create the impression of a compound full
K19 1340  2    of children. Do you think you can manage it"?
K19 1340 11       Mavis smiled. "I'll try".
K19 1350  4       As Rector was walking back toward the residential
K19 1360  3    hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded
K19 1360 12    up to him. The altercation in the coffee house had
K19 1370 10    done little to dampen his spirits, but he was still
K19 1380  7    a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed
K19 1390  5    the incident. "I think I've fixed the pump so we won't
K19 1400  4    have to worry about it for a long time", he said. "I've
K19 1410  1    adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before
K19 1410 11    the water gets too low".
K19 1420  4       "Fine", Rector said. He looked out over the expanse
K19 1430  3    of the compound. It was going to take a lot of activity
K19 1440  1    to fill it. "Have you ever operated a transit"? he
K19 1440 11    said.
K19 1450  1       "No, sir", Johnson said.
K19 1450  5       "You are about to become a first-class surveyor",
K19 1460  4    Rector said. "When Konishi gets back with the jeep,
K19 1470  3    I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys.
K19 1470 14    Konishi can help you. You'll find an old transit in
K19 1480 10    the basement. The glass is out of it, but that won't
K19 1490  9    matter. It looks pretty efficient and that's the important
K19 1500  5    thing". He went on to explain what he had in mind.
K19 1510  4    Johnson nodded. He said he could do it.
K19 1510 12       Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the
K19 1520 10    time he got back to the residential hall. It was rather
K19 1530  5    a childish game, all in all, but everybody seemed to
K19 1540  3    be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could
K19 1540 14    not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything
K19 1550  8    quite so much. He was not sure what effect it would
K19 1560  7    have, but that was really beside the point when you
K19 1570  3    got right down to it. He was not going to lose the
K19 1570 15    mission by default, and whatever reason Kayabashi had
K19 1580  8    for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission,
K19 1590  7    he was going to be in for a surprise.
K19 1600  1       He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to
K19 1600 11    make sure everything was in order in the residential
K19 1610  9    hall, and then to take charge of the office while the
K19 1620  7    party was here. When everything had been done, Rector
K19 1630  3    went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly
K19 1640  1    report until three o'clock.
K19 1640  5       At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the
K19 1650  6    wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep
K19 1660  2    an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he
K19 1660 14    first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi's party. Then
K19 1670  7    Rector, attired in his best blue serge suit, sat in
K19 1680  6    a chair out on the lawn, in the shade of a tree, smoking
K19 1690  3    a cigarette and waiting. The air was cooler here, and
K19 1690 13    the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow
K19 1700 10    on the grass, an effect which he found pleasant.
