E05 0010  1       At the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square
E05 0010 10    Garden, New York on the second day, the Finals of the
E05 0020 11    Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition
E05 0030  7    in the history of this Class. The Class had entries
E05 0040  5    from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky.
E05 0050  4    This year several entries from Canada were entered
E05 0060  1    which made the Junior Class International.
E05 0060  7       Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries
E05 0070  8    were present. It was interesting to note that many
E05 0080  5    of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other
E05 0090  1    classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior
E05 0090 12    Class.
E05 0100  1       As has been the custom for the past several years,
E05 0100 11    John Cross, Jr., Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster, arranged
E05 0110  8    for the Juniors' meeting before the Class, and invited
E05 0120  7    two speakers from the dog world to address them. Over
E05 0130  6    60 Juniors, parents and guests attended.
E05 0140  1    #MRS. WILLIAM H. LONG, JR. SPEAKS#
E05 0140  7    After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for
E05 0150  6    qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class, Mrs.
E05 0160  4    William H. Long, Jr. was introduced as the first speaker.
E05 0170  4       In her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the
E05 0180  3    Juniors and stated, "There isn't any other show quite
E05 0190  1    like Westminster. I know because this is my 37th year
E05 0190 11    with hardly a break. Mrs. Long still feels the same
E05 0200  9    unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present
E05 0210  6    Juniors will experience today but probably will not
E05 0220  3    appreciate in full for a number of years.
E05 0220 11       Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then
E05 0230  8    13 years of age, won the Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's
E05 0240  5    Handling Class (as they were called then) at Westminster.
E05 0250  5    No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs.
E05 0260  4    Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet
E05 0270  3    or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won!
E05 0280  1       Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs. Long
E05 0280  9    advised the Juniors: "When showing dogs ceases to be
E05 0290  7    fun and excitement, STOP! Dogs have a way of sensing
E05 0300  8    our feelings! When you and your dog step into the Junior
E05 0310  7    ring, it should be just what the dog wants to do as
E05 0320  5    much as what you want him to do. If you walk into the
E05 0330  1    ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel
E05 0330 13    it and give you a good performance! He knows your signals,
E05 0340  8    what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted,
E05 0350  8    right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers".
E05 0360  4    #RIGHT ATTITUDE ESSENTIAL!#
E05 0360  7    "Take away your attitude", said Mrs. Long, "and what
E05 0370  9    have you left? Either a nervous dog because you are
E05 0380  8    livid with rage- a sure sign that you are taking things
E05 0390  6    too seriously and had better stop! Or a bored dog because
E05 0400  4    you are more interested in something else- maybe the
E05 0410  2    way you look, or the date you have after the Class,
E05 0410 13    or you are just doing this to please the parents.
E05 0420  7       "The reason you are in the ring today is to show
E05 0430  7    your ability to present to any judge the most attractive
E05 0440  2    picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids
E05 0440 13    can produce. Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or
E05 0450 10    horsemanship classes- riding a horse and showing a
E05 0460  9    dog are very similar!
E05 0460 13       "Your aids are your attitude, which comes through
E05 0470  8    your voice, your hands and legs- voice to encourage,
E05 0480  6    discourage or whatever the need may be; hands to guide
E05 0490  5    or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of speed.
E05 0500  2    Without right attitude the other aids just do not work
E05 0500 12    right".
E05 0510  1       Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class
E05 0510 11    and stated, "Have fun! And may you all continue to
E05 0520 10    show at Westminster in the years to come"!
E05 0530  6    #HARVEY BARCUS, SECOND SPEAKER#
E05 0530 10    The second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of
E05 0540  8    the Dog Writers Ass'n of America.
E05 0550  4       Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships
E05 0560  2    for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year
E05 0570  1    a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred
E05 0570 12    Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He
E05 0580  8    gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy
E05 0590  9    he sponsored to win the scholarship.
E05 0600  1       "Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project
E05 0600  8    and should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr.
E05 0610  9    Barcus' strong beliefs. He feels very forcibly that
E05 0620  7    the American Kennel Club should take a MORE ACTIVE
E05 0630  5    part in encouraging the Junior Division!
E05 0640  1       In closing, Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors
E05 0650  1    luck in their Class.
E05 0650  5    #WESTMINSTER SHOW NOTES#
E05 0650  8    Instead of 3 a.m. in the past, the Juniors Class at
E05 0660  8    Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m. This gave the Juniors
E05 0670  6    the use of the entire ring at the show- a great advantage
E05 0680  4    to them!
E05 0680  6       Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward
E05 0690  5    announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs
E05 0700  3    around the ring and set them up, they could relax with
E05 0700 14    their dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to
E05 0710 10    be judged individually. This thoughtful gesture was
E05 0720  5    well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry
E05 0730  5    of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 45
E05 0740  2    minutes to judge the Class.
E05 0740  7    #ANNE HONE ROGERS JUDGES 28TH FINALS#
E05 0750  1    This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged
E05 0750  9    the Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior
E05 0760 12    Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has
E05 0770  7    judged the Class.
E05 0770 10       As the Juniors entered the ring, Mr. Spring, the
E05 0780  8    announcer, stated over the public-address system that
E05 0790  6    this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the
E05 0800  4    Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed
E05 0810  1    last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel
E05 0810 10    Club recognized shows to be eligible to compete in
E05 0820  8    this Class- the Finals for the year. A Junior who won
E05 0830  8    two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible.
E05 0840  3       (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition
E05 0850  1    is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen.
E05 0850 11    Many adults showing at Westminster today are products
E05 0860  8    of this Class.)
E05 0870  1       It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers
E05 0870 10    to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A
E05 0880  9    large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to
E05 0890  7    their credit and are seasoned campaigners.
E05 0900  1       After the judge moved all the dogs individually,
E05 0900  9    she selected several from the group and placed them
E05 0910  8    in the center of the ring. She then went over them
E05 0920  5    thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.
E05 0930  1    #INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF THE YEAR#
E05 0930  6    BETTY LOU HAM, age 16, Holyoke, Mass., showing an Irish
E05 0940  7    Setter, was chosen as International Champion of the
E05 0950  4    year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns'
E05 0960  2    LEONARD BRUMBY, SR. Memorial Trophy (named for the
E05 0970  4    FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)
E05 0980  1       Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to
E05 0980 12    her credit last year. In addition to showing an Irish
E05 0990  9    Setter throughout the year, she also scored with an
E05 1000  6    Afghan.
E05 1000  7    #OTHER WINNERS#
E05 1000  9    SYDNEY LE BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N.Y., showing
E05 1010  8    a Doberman Pinscher, was 2nd.
E05 1020  3       SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore, Md., showing
E05 1030  3    a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed 3rd
E05 1040  2    in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep-
E05 1050  1    Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior
E05 1050 12    Classes in both United States and Canada.
E05 1060  6       KAREN MARCMANN, age 16, Trapp, Penna., showing a
E05 1070  5    Keeshond was 4th.
E05 1070  8       Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are
E05 1080  8    seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior
E05 1090  6    Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well.
E05 1100  2    #ENTRIES INCREASING- REQUIREMENTS RAISED#
E05 1100  6    In 1960, there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes.
E05 1110  8    Each year these shows have increased in entries. Next
E05 1120  5    year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show Committee
E05 1130  2    has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN
E05 1140  1    3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY
E05 1140 11    TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.
E05 1150  1       PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be at the
E05 1160  3    International Show this year for the Junior Judging
E05 1160 11    Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia
E05 1170 10    in March.
E05 1170 12    #JUDGING CLASS FOR INTERMEDIATES PROPOSED#
E05 1180  5    It has been suggested many times that a Class be set
E05 1190  6    up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter
E05 1200  1    the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been
E05 1200 11    suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates
E05 1210  7    over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible
E05 1220  6    to compete in the Junior Class.
E05 1230  1       Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester
E05 1230 11    KC Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased
E05 1240  9    with the Class, but it aroused the interest of all
E05 1250  8    in attendance that day. The Intermediates in the Class
E05 1260  4    with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give
E05 1270  3    their reasons but their decisions did not affect the
E05 1270 12    choice of the Judge.
E05 1280  4       We suggested this Class in the horse world and it
E05 1290  2    was accepted immediately and included in the programs
E05 1290 10    of horse shows At the recent horse show convention
E05 1300  7    in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging
E05 1310  5    Class is meeting with great success and will be a great
E05 1320  6    help to future judges in the horse world.
E05 1330  1       This Class can be just as successful in the dog
E05 1330 11    world if it is given a chance. Last year Robert Harris,
E05 1340  7    a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest
E05 1350  5    (Junior) at the International KC of Chicago show and
E05 1360  5    had the highest score in judging of any Junior since
E05 1370  2    the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago
E05 1370 10    show should make a point to enter this Class as it
E05 1380 11    would be of great help to them.
E05 1390  3    #MORE VOLUNTEER HANDLERS NEEDED TO JUDGE#
E05 1390  9    Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more
E05 1400  9    difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior
E05 1410  5    Showmanship Competition. The founder of the Junior
E05 1420  3    Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr.
E05 1430  1    (for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster)
E05 1430 10    was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should
E05 1440  7    have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting
E05 1450  6    with the Junior Showmanship Division.
E05 1460  1       Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities
E05 1460 10    who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's
E05 1470  9    ability to show a dog. To overcome this unfair judging,
E05 1480  5    the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present
E05 1490  4    to judge the Class. If the superintendents do not receive
E05 1500  4    more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested
E05 1510  1    that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this
E05 1510 10    Class. By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested
E05 1520  6    in the dog world, all will be helping to create future
E05 1530  6    dog owners.
E05 1530  8    #OTHER AWARDS FOR JUNIORS#
E05 1535  1    The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry
E05 1540  8    Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration
E05 1550  7    donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with
E05 1560  8    their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any
E05 1570  3    Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka KCs are arranging
E05 1580  3    that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified
E05 1580 13    to win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande KC is
E05 1590 10    also considering having their Junior Classes set up
E05 1600  7    so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster.
E05 1610  5       The American Pointer Club is still continuing to
E05 1620  5    donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship
E05 1630  2    Classes with Pointers.
E05 1640  1       Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles-
E05 1640  8    with two Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten,
E05 1650  9    we've worked up a regular routine for acceptance at
E05 1660  6    motels.
E05 1660  7       My husband enters the motel office, signs up for
E05 1670  6    a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter if he
E05 1680  3    accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question.
E05 1690  1    "No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken,
E05 1700  1    and obedience-trained".
E05 1700  4       We've never been refused!
E05 1710  1       Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in
E05 1710 10    an out of the way spot, keep them under control in
E05 1720  7    the room, and feed and bench them where they can't
E05 1730  3    do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.
E05 1740  1       In the morning we leave the room looking as neat
E05 1740 11    as a pin!
E05 1750  1       Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again-
E05 1750 10    has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs
E05 1760  9    to most children.
E05 1770  1       So many times I have wondered why veterinarians
E05 1770  9    do not wipe the table clean before each new canine
E05 1780  7    patient is placed on it for examination. Is it that
E05 1790  4    they don't care? Are they indifferent to the fact that
E05 1800  3    the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding
E05 1800 13    patient?
