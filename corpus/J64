J64 0010  1       If one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov,
J64 0010  7    it is the consistency with which every person on the
J64 0020  9    stage- including the chorus- comes alive in the music.
J64 0030  6    Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's
J64 0040  3    care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections.
J64 0050  2    In this he followed a path that led back to the very
J64 0060  1    source of opera; such composers as Monteverdi, Lully
J64 0060  9    and Purcell, with the same goal in mind, had developed
J64 0070  9    styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own
J64 0080  5    languages. Through long experimentation in his songs,
J64 0090  4    Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different
J64 0100  1    from others as the language itself. Giving most of
J64 0100 10    his musical continuity to the orchestra, he lets the
J64 0110  7    speech fall into place as if by coincidence, but controlling
J64 0120  3    the pace and emphasis of the words.
J64 0130  1       The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense,
J64 0130  9    come most often when the character is actually supposed
J64 0140  6    to be singing, as in folk songs and liturgical chants.
J64 0150  3    Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for
J64 0160  2    prolonged expressions of emotion- Boris' first monologue,
J64 0160  9    for example. Even then, the flexibility of the phrasing
J64 0170  9    suggests that the word comes first in importance.
J64 0180  7       Aside from Boris himself, one need but examine the
J64 0190  6    secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters
J64 0200  3    of musical portraiture. Even those who appear in only
J64 0200 12    one or two scenes are full personalities, defined with
J64 0210  9    economical precision. Consider the four monks who figure
J64 0220  7    prominently in the action: Pimen, Varlaam, Missail
J64 0230  4    and the Jesuit Rangoni. Under no circumstances could
J64 0240  2    we mistake one for the other; each musical setting
J64 0240 11    has an individual touch.
J64 0250  4       Pimen is an old man, weak in body- his voice rarely
J64 0260  3    rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind.
J64 0270  1    His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful
J64 0270  8    excitement. A quiet but sturdy theme, somewhat folklike
J64 0280  7    in character, appears whenever the old monk speaks
J64 0300  5    of the history he is recording or of his own past life:
J64 0310  2    @
J64 0310  3       This theme comes to represent the outer world, the
J64 0320  1    realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance,
J64 0320 10    quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the
J64 0330  8    monastery. It changes and develops according to the
J64 0340  4    text; it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris
J64 0350  2    in the last act. Once he has been identified, however,
J64 0350 12    a new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a
J64 0360 10    bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient
J64 0370  6    effect: @
J64 0370  8       An imaginative storyteller, Pimen takes on the character
J64 0380  7    he describes, as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's
J64 0390  6    blindness and miraculous cure. Here the composer uses
J64 0400  5    a favorite device of his, the intensification of the
J64 0410  3    mood through key relationships. The original D minor
J64 0410 11    seems to symbolize blindness, inescapable in spite
J64 0420  7    of all attempts to move away from it. As the child
J64 0430  7    addresses the shepherd in a dream, light- in the form
J64 0440  6    of the major mode- begins to appear, and at the moment
J64 0450  1    of the miracle we hear a clear and shining D major.
J64 0450 12       Varlaam and Missail always appear together and often
J64 0460  8    sing together, in a straightforward, rhythmically vigorous
J64 0470  2    idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle
J64 0480  4    and well-educated Pimen. Their begging song might easily
J64 0490  2    be a folk melody: @
J64 0490  7       The same could be said for the song to which they
J64 0500  5    make their entrance in the final scene. Apparently
J64 0510  1    their origin is humble, their approach to life direct
J64 0510 10    and unsophisticated. Whatever learning they may have
J64 0520  6    had in their order doesn't disturb them now.
J64 0530  3       Missail is the straight man, not very talkative,
J64 0540  1    mild-mannered when he does speak. Varlaam is loud,
J64 0540 10    rowdy, uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with
J64 0550  7    anyone who is not the same. A rough ostinato figure,
J64 0560  4    heard first in the introduction to the inn scene, characterizes
J64 0570  3    him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into
J64 0580  1    the action: @
J64 0580  4       The Song of Kazan, in which this figure becomes
J64 0590  2    a wild-sounding accompaniment, fills in the picture
J64 0590 10    of undisciplined high spirits. The phrasing is irregular,
J64 0600  7    and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness.
J64 0610  6    (We can imagine how they startled audiences of the
J64 0620  4    1870's.)
J64 0620  5       Varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the
J64 0630  5    effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together
J64 0640  1    when the need arises. Both monks respond to the guard's
J64 0640 11    challenge with a few phrases of their begging song;
J64 0650  9    a clever naturalistic touch is Varlaam's labored reading
J64 0660  5    of the warrant. As the knack gradually comes back to
J64 0670  4    him, his rhythm becomes steadier, with the rigid monotony
J64 0680  1    of an unskilled reader. For the only time in the opera,
J64 0680 12    words are not set according to their natural inflection;
J64 0690  9    to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the
J64 0700  8    scene.
J64 0700  9       Musically and dramatically, Rangoni is as far removed
J64 0710  7    from the conventional monk as Varlaam. His music shows
J64 0720  5    a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest
J64 0730  3    somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's
J64 0740  1    Hoffman. His speech shows none of the native accent
J64 0740 10    of the Russian characters; in spite of the Italian
J64 0750  8    name, he sounds French. His personality appears more
J64 0760  5    striking by contrast with Marina, who is- perhaps purposely-
J64 0770  3    rather superficially characterized.
J64 0780  1       Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden
J64 0780 10    open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded
J64 0790 10    it. The effect is as if he had materialized out of
J64 0800  7    nowhere. He speaks quietly, concealing his authority
J64 0810  3    beneath a smooth humility, just as the shifting harmonies
J64 0820  1    that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point
J64 0820 11    beneath them. He addresses Marina with great deference,
J64 0830  7    calling her "Princess" at first; it is only after he
J64 0840  8    has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses
J64 0850  4    her given name, placing himself by implication in the
J64 0860  1    position of a solicitous father.
J64 0860  6       Curiously, this scene is a close parallel to one
J64 0870  4    that Verdi was writing at the same time, the scene
J64 0880  1    between Amonasro and Aida. Rangoni and Amonasro have
J64 0880  9    the same purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man
J64 0890  8    she loves into serving her country's cause- and their
J64 0900  5    tactics are much the same. Rangoni begins by describing
J64 0910  3    the sad state of the Church; this brings a reaction
J64 0920  1    of distress from Marina. The music becomes ethereal
J64 0920  9    as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood: it is
J64 0930 10    she, he tells her, who can bring the truth to Russia
J64 0940  6    and convert the heretics. As if in a trance, she repeats
J64 0950  3    his words- then realizes, with a shock, her own audacity.
J64 0960  1    This is no assignment for a frivolous girl, she assures
J64 0960 11    him.
J64 0970  1       Now Rangoni comes to the point, and we hear, for
J64 0970 11    the first time, a long, downward chromatic scale that
J64 0980  7    will become the characteristic motif of his sinister
J64 0990  5    power. It is a phrase as arresting as a magician's
J64 1000  1    gesture, with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect
J64 1000 11    of strangeness. Another theme, sinuously chromatic,
J64 1010  5    appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori
J64 1020  6    by any means, even at the cost of her honor. Coming
J64 1030  2    from a priest, the music sounds as odd as the advice:
J64 1040  1    @
J64 1040  2       Marina rebels at this suggestion. Her pride is as
J64 1040 11    much at stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable
J64 1050  9    beauty, the princess who turns away suitors by the
J64 1060  6    dozen. Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil
J64 1070  4    thoughts and orders him to leave her.
J64 1070 11       At once the Jesuit pulls out all the stops. To music
J64 1080  9    of a menacing darkness, he describes the powers of
J64 1090  6    Satan gaining control of the girl, poisoning her soul
J64 1100  3    with pride and destroying her beauty. The combined
J64 1100 11    threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her,
J64 1110 11    and she falls terrified at his feet. With another sudden
J64 1120  7    change of mood, he is again calm and protective, exhorting
J64 1130  3    her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman- and the
J64 1140  5    chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction.
J64 1140 11    Whatever the source of Rangoni's power, Marina is his
J64 1150  9    captive now; we are reminded of this at the end of
J64 1160  9    the next scene, when his theme cuts through the warmth
J64 1170  4    of the love duet, again throwing a chill over the atmosphere.
J64 1180  2       The most unusual feature of Boris, however, is the
J64 1190  3    use of the greatest character of all, the chorus. This
J64 1190 13    is the real protagonist of the drama; the conflict
J64 1200  8    is not Boris versus Grigori or Shuiski or even the
J64 1210  6    ghost of the murdered child, but Boris versus the Russian
J64 1220  4    people. Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent
J64 1230  2    to which choral scenes propel the action. Boris' first
J64 1230 11    entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of
J64 1240  9    the Coronation Scene, with its dazzling confusion of
J64 1250  6    tonalities. We have a brief glimpse of the Tsar's public
J64 1260  5    personality, the "official Boris", but our real focus
J64 1270  3    is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast
J64 1280  1    with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene,
J64 1280  9    its bitter resentment and fury in the final act.
J64 1290  8       One reason for the unique vitality of the chorus
J64 1300  5    is its great variety in expression. It rarely speaks
J64 1310  2    as a unit. Even in its most conventional appearance,
J64 1310 11    the guests' song of praise to Marina, there are a few
J64 1320 10    female dissenters criticizing the princess for her
J64 1330  5    coldness. In many passages- for example, the council
J64 1340  3    of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character
J64 1350  1    group with a particular opinion. Hot arguments arise
J64 1350  9    between tenors and basses, who will sing in harmony
J64 1360  9    only when they agree on an idea.
J64 1370  2       The opening scene shows this method at its most
J64 1370 11    individual. Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of
J64 1380  7    the common people, those who must suffer the effects
J64 1390  6    of their rulers' struggle for power without understanding
J64 1400  2    the causes. They are held in control by force, but
J64 1410  1    barely. They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership
J64 1410 10    in a strangely intense song, its phrases irregularly
J64 1420  6    broken as if gasping for breath, but when the police
J64 1430  5    with their cudgels move away, they mock and grumble
J64 1440  2    and fight among themselves. There is a quick change
J64 1440 11    from the plaintive song to a conversational tone. "Hey,
J64 1450  8    Mityukh", asks one group, "what are we shouting about"?
J64 1460  7    And Mityukh, apparently the intellectual leader of
J64 1470  5    the crowd, replies that he has no notion. The jokes
J64 1480  3    and arguments grow louder until the police return;
J64 1480 11    then the people strike up their song with even more
J64 1490 10    fervor than before, ending it with a wail of despair.
J64 1500  7       Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with
J64 1510  3    considerable dramatic force. In Pimen's cell the soft
J64 1520  2    prayers of the monks, heard from offstage, not only
J64 1520 11    help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between
J64 1530  8    young Grigori's thoughts and his situation. This is
J64 1540  6    especially striking between Pimen's quiet exit and
J64 1550  4    Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris.
J64 1560  1       Again, as Boris feels himself nearing death, a procession
J64 1560  9    files into the hall singing a hymn, its modal harmonies
J64 1570  9    adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere: @ The
J64 1580  7    words are hardly calculated to put the Tsar's mind
J64 1590  6    at ease. They echo the words with which he has described
J64 1600  4    his own vision of the dying child who "trembles and
J64 1610  1    begs for mercy- and there is no mercy". The living
J64 1610 11    as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder
J64 1620  9    of his guilt is the fatal one.
J64 1630  2       One of the outstanding assets of the present production
J64 1640  1    is the restoration of the St. Basil's scene, usually
J64 1640 10    omitted from performances and rarely included in a
J64 1650  8    published score. Though brief, it has a sharp dramatic
J64 1660  6    edge and great poignancy. In addition, it is an important
J64 1670  5    link in the plot, giving us a revealing glimpse of
J64 1680  1    the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri.
J64 1680 10    The mayhem in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel.
J64 1690 10       The St. Basil's scene opens with little groups of
J64 1700  7    beggars milling around the square, the ever present
J64 1710  5    police keeping them under scrutiny. In the orchestra
J64 1720  2    we hear first a hushed, hesitant pizzicato figure,
J64 1720 10    then the insistent "police" motif as it appeared in
J64 1730  9    the opening scene.
J64 1740  1       The service is over, and a number of people come
J64 1740 11    from the church with their spokesman Mityukh in the
J64 1750  7    lead. They bring the news that the Pretender has been
J64 1760  5    excommunicated; this is met with scorn by the hearers,
J64 1770  3    who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk. (Mussorgsky
J64 1770 12    cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral
J64 1780  8    accompaniment, solemn chords or mocking staccatos.)
J64 1790  5    There is still more news, Mityukh announces: they have
J64 1800  4    prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich.
