P29 0010  1       "Good old A-Z", Cap said. "You know, I've got
P29 0020  1    one of your cars at home. as a prominent industrialist,
P29 0020 11    you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group.
P29 0030  8    Isn't his racket down your alley"?
P29 0040  3       Once it was, William thought. But not any more.
P29 0050  3       A rush of memory swept him back, and he forgot Cap.
P29 0060  1    How did he start on such a ride to brief glory? Simply
P29 0060 13    enough, through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law.
P29 0070 10    General Hershey's draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were
P29 0080  8    responsible for his first eminence, but Fearless Freddy
P29 0090  5    Bryan could take credit, if he cared to (and he did),
P29 0100  5    for the second time. Freddy needed a job, having been
P29 0110  1    detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate
P29 0110 10    and skyscraper financing by Gerry, and it was up to
P29 0120  9    Arthur Willis to provide him with one.
P29 0130  3       Mr. Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products, a skeleton
P29 0140  2    corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes
P29 0140 10    and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics
P29 0150  9    plants on Long Island engaged in working out government
P29 0160  7    contracts, and installed Freddy in an executive position.
P29 0170  5    Shortly after, Freddy had his usual proliferation of
P29 0180  3    bold ideas. Willis listened patiently, and once in
P29 0180 11    a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering;
P29 0190 11    he generally heard Freddy's suggestions without interest,
P29 0200  6    being absorbed by his own prospering concerns.
P29 0210  5       Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper
P29 0220  3    involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his
P29 0230  2    grandchildren. Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father,
P29 0230 11    prodded, no doubt, by Joan's open contempt for Freddy
P29 0240  9    and William's irritating competency. Another factor
P29 0250  4    must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune;
P29 0260  4    she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined
P29 0270  4    with Freddy, the more likely he was to reward Freddy
P29 0280  1    richly upon his death.
P29 0280  5       Whatever the reasons, Willis and Bryan started expanding
P29 0290  3    Zenith. They acquired another electronics factory,
P29 0300  1    a specialized ceramics company, an organization that
P29 0300  8    built- very experimentally- high-speed research calculators.
P29 0310  5    Since they were hunting for national defense contracts,
P29 0320  6    Adam Herberet, a man of surprising resources, entered
P29 0330  3    the combination as a silent partner because of his
P29 0340  3    political connections.
P29 0340  5       Feeling his power, Freddy looked for additional
P29 0350  3    worlds to conquer. Heavy industry, slanted toward inexhaustible
P29 0360  1    government coffers, attracted him. The Allstates Auto
P29 0370  1    Company, a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive
P29 0370 11    vehicles and other off-road equipment, had recently
P29 0380  8    constructed an over-large, modern plant in a burst
P29 0390  6    of misguided optimism. Cursed with a shaky management
P29 0400  2    and dissatisfied stockholders, it was ripe for amalgamation,
P29 0410  1    and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock
P29 0410 10    mergers and small expenditure of cash, and never mind
P29 0420  8    inevitable consequences. With Herberet's blessing,
P29 0430  3    he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin folly would
P29 0440  3    be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly, tanks,
P29 0450  1    missiles or ordnance of some kind.
P29 0450  7       At that point William came into the picture. Although
P29 0460  6    not much desiring the account, he had been appointed
P29 0470  3    advertising head of Zenith. Freed of routine by having
P29 0480  1    his own firm and a complaisant partner, his work in
P29 0480 11    New York had given him a broader overall knowledge
P29 0490  7    of business administration and corporate structure;
P29 0500  2    and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did,
P29 0510  2    he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities.
P29 0520  1    Mr. Willis, eager to have him allied with the family,
P29 0520 11    wanted advice beyond the confines of his field, and
P29 0530  8    William set out on a serious study of the situation,
P29 0540  5    including trips to Wisconsin and Washington.
P29 0550  1       In the end, he said: "I'm not enchanted by the proposition,
P29 0560  1    sir. I know a guy named Jack Hamrick, a very bright
P29 0560 12    young engineer who was with Chrysler, and I took him
P29 0570 10    with me to Allstates. It's his expert opinion that
P29 0580  6    the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind.
P29 0590  5    The conversion will cost a fortune. Besides that, I'm
P29 0600  2    acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation
P29 0600 11    through my contacts in the Air Force. I think Adam
P29 0610 10    Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better
P29 0620  7    informed on defense financing than on the technical
P29 0630  4    side. Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs,
P29 0640  1    and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here.
P29 0640 12    The future of manned aircraft is in doubt, which affects
P29 0650  7    government procurement, and jet transports have revolutionized
P29 0670  4    the airline trade- one jet can take the place of three
P29 0680  5    compound-engine planes. This means the aircraft companies
P29 0690  1    are going to tear into the government market, looking
P29 0690 10    for anything they can get and making the competition
P29 0700  8    tough. Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled.
P29 0710  5    Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the
P29 0720  5    dust settles"?
P29 0720  7       Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and
P29 0730  5    shrugged. "Well", he said, "there is Freddy, you know
P29 0740  3    ... And Gerry. Freddy is deeply committed to our plans
P29 0750  2    already. He assures me he has people to handle the
P29 0750 12    money raising, and Ham Richert, my lawyer, says the
P29 0760  8    legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates
P29 0770  5    are no problem. I don't like to exhibit the deadly
P29 0780  3    dampening effect of an elderly man's caution".
P29 0790  1       "Yes, I appreciate that. I wish you wouldn't tell
P29 0790 10    Freddy I'm lukewarm; I've caused him trouble before,
P29 0800  7    and he's beginning to resent me. If we don't take care,
P29 0810  9    the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides,
P29 0820  5    brandishing their cudgels".
P29 0820  8       "Which is a frightful prospect, Bill". Willis laughed.
P29 0830  8    "One shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy,
P29 0840  6    but in this case I have no choice ... Let me think
P29 0850  7    about it. I'm most grateful to you, so grateful I wish
P29 0860  4    you were my principal aide instead of Freddy".
P29 0870  1       Not to William's surprise, Freddy, Adam and Hamilton
P29 0870  9    Richert prevailed; allied to them was Gerry, devoting
P29 0880  8    much time to swaying her father, and Joan dismissed
P29 0890  6    all thought of the project and William was unwilling
P29 0900  3    to interfere further. Zenith absorbed Allstates, stock
P29 0910  2    transfers were arranged, and Freddy became president
P29 0910  9    of the hyphenated combination. Through Jack Hamrick,
P29 0920  5    William fell into the world of automobile promotion
P29 0930  5    and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay.
P29 0940  2       He forgot about A-Z till, unhappily, he and Hamrick
P29 0950  1    were proved correct. Freddy's backing dropped away
P29 0950  8    from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit.
P29 0960 11    Adam, beset by changing defense conditions and the
P29 0970  6    open secret that he was part of the new corporation,
P29 0980  3    couldn't deliver from his end. The Wisconsin plant
P29 0990  1    turned out to be a white elephant. Stock Willis held
P29 0990 11    in abundance fell sharply in value. Confronted by a
P29 1000  8    grim future, Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for
P29 1010  5    a drastic liquidation.
P29 1010  8       Once more Willis summoned William. "You were right",
P29 1020  6    he said- "you and your engineer- and I'm in something
P29 1030  5    of a bind. Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me.
P29 1040  5    In addition to other defects, I'm a stubborn man and
P29 1050  3    hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment.
P29 1060  1    Will you see if you can help me"?
P29 1060  9       William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick.
P29 1070  6    His recent experience in motor car advertising, a love
P29 1080  3    for cars of themselves, the existence of A-Z's useless
P29 1090  2    Wisconsin set-up, exposure to exciting conceptions
P29 1090  9    of Hamrick's that nobody would buy, and the coincidental
P29 1100  8    recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car
P29 1110  9    manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him
P29 1120  5    an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to
P29 1130  2    broach it. Initially, Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going
P29 1140  1    into the passenger car market was discouraging. He
P29 1140  9    thought the financing, the advertising, the production
P29 1150  5    of new models, the founding of a nationwide chain of
P29 1160  5    dealerships was simply too difficult. Then he caught
P29 1170  1    fire. If A-Z could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use
P29 1170 11    their presses and dies and other equipment, if William
P29 1180  9    could hit precisely the right promotion note, if the
P29 1190  7    money hurdle was not insurmountable ...
P29 1200  2       They took nearly a month to investigate, marshal
P29 1200 10    statistics, and put their arguments down in black and
P29 1210  9    white. Taking Hamrick with him, William went to Mr.
P29 1220  7    Willis. He was surprised and dubious, but impressed
P29 1230  3    by the engineer and the report.
P29 1230  9       "Your alternative is breathtaking", he said, "and,
P29 1250  6    I'm frank in saying, a bit mad. I wish I was younger
P29 1260  9    and less timid ... Well, I can't resolve this myself.
P29 1270  4    I'll have to call in the brain trust. Are you willing
P29 1280  2    to run the gantlet? I can't guarantee you a sympathetic
P29 1290  1    audience".
P29 1290  2       "We'll be in there swinging", William said, "but
P29 1300  2    in a way, sir, you've got to decide it yourself. You
P29 1300 13    have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure
P29 1310  8    is yours- and, besides, nobody else is going to have
P29 1320  9    the courage. If they follow anyone, it'll have to be
P29 1330  6    you". He paused. "I should explain: there's more here
P29 1340  4    for me than advocating my little dream, there's you.
P29 1350  2    You mustn't take a fall, or publicly back away. I hate
P29 1350 13    that. You're- you're Arthur Willis ... Forgive the
P29 1360  7    hearts and flowers theme".
P29 1370  3       "I rather like the music", Willis replied quietly.
P29 1380  2    "Thank you".
P29 1380  4       At the meeting, attended by Freddy, Richert, Herberet
P29 1390  3    and the A-Z executive staff, with Mr. Willis presiding,
P29 1400  4    William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet. From
P29 1410  2    shock and incredulity, most of the listeners went on
P29 1410 11    to open resistance and animosity.
P29 1420  4       "Oh, my God", Ham Richert said, "a little child
P29 1430  5    shall lead them. Move over, General Motors".
P29 1440  1       "It's absurd, Bill", Freddy said, from a pale face.
P29 1450  1    "You're leading Dad down the garden path".
P29 1450  8       "Your garden, God damn it"! William said.
P29 1470  6       "I don't enjoy family quarrels", Adam said. "Nor
P29 1480  5    crazy relatives. We're here to transact business. Can't
P29 1490  4    we put an end to this, Arthur"?
P29 1500  1       "Hear me out, please", William begged. "I'm an advertising
P29 1510  1    hustler, I admit, but I have to get hot once in a larger
P29 1510 14    sphere. Sure, Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced
P29 1520  9    market bucking the Big Three. Their cars weren't small
P29 1530  6    enough, they didn't have the power, they were old-fashioned.
P29 1540  6    They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit.
P29 1550  3    We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery. We've
P29 1560  2    all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine
P29 1560 13    age. Look what those little European jobs are doing.
P29 1570  9    We'll woo the consumer with a product, not bludgeon
P29 1580  7    him with chromed excess length and weight. Let's make
P29 1590  5    it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction,
P29 1600  3    at reasonable rates. Ticonderoga folded a few minutes
P29 1600 11    too soon, before the tide changed, still honest and
P29 1610  9    stupid- and the network of dealers the company had
P29 1620  6    is around waiting to be signed up again- waiting for
P29 1630  5    us, ready-made. We've got rid of the steam yachts and
P29 1640  2    Georgian houses, and the bloated, too-expensive automobile
P29 1640 10    is next. Why not come down smartly in the world, in
P29 1650 11    a chic fashion, with an Allstates-Zenith"?
P29 1660  4       He swayed them somewhat, but the debate raged on.
P29 1670  4    Financing emerged as the main obstacle. Mr. Willis
P29 1680  1    made it evident that he had contributed his maximum.
P29 1680 10       "Nobody will underwrite it, I'm telling you", Freddy
P29 1690  8    said. "I know what I'm talking about in that department".
P29 1700  8       "There's plenty of risk money", Ham Richert added,
P29 1710  8    "but not for anything this risky".
P29 1720  3       "All right", William said. "We'll try to swing the
P29 1730  5    deal on that basis. If we can't raise the capital,
P29 1740  1    we're through. Nothing has been lost. You're up against
P29 1740 10    it anyhow. Why won't you give me a chance"?
P29 1750  8       A silence fell. Heads instinctively turned in Willis'
P29 1760  6    direction. He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his
P29 1770  5    hands together.
P29 1770  7       "I feel I must answer the question", he said, "since
P29 1780  7    the onus later, if any, should fall on me- I don't
P29 1790  6    relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family
P29 1800  3    ... I'm not giving you a chance, Bill, but availing
P29 1810  1    myself of your generous offer of assistance. Good luck
P29 1810 10    to you".
P29 1820  1       "All the in-laws have got to have their day", Adam
P29 1820 12    said, and glared at William and Freddy in turn.
P29 1830  8       Sweat started out on William's forehead, whether
P29 1840  4    from relief or disquietude he could not tell. Across
P29 1850  3    the table, Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled
P29 1860  1    thumb and forefinger. Nobody else showed pleasure.
P29 1860  8    ##
P29 1860  9    Spike-haired, burly, red-faced, decked with horn-rimmed
P29 1870  8    glasses and an Ivy League suit, Jack Hamrick awaited
P29 1880  6    William at the officers' club. "Hello, boss", he said,
P29 1890  5    and grinned. "I suppose I can never expect to call
P29 1900  4    you 'General' after that Washington episode".
P29 1910  1       "I'm afraid not".
