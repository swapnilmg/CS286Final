J60 0010  1    (Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper.)
J60 0010 10    And without high density in the core, rapid-transit
J60 0020  8    systems cannot be maintained economically, let alone
J60 0030  4    built from scratch at today's prices.
J60 0040  1       However, the building of freeways and garages cannot
J60 0040  8    continue forever. The new interchange among the four
J60 0050  7    Los Angeles freeways, including the grade-constructed
J60 0060  4    accesses, occupies by itself no less than eighty acres
J60 0070  2    of downtown land, one-eighth of a square mile, an area
J60 0080  1    about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York. It
J60 0080 11    is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete
J60 0090  7    constitutes what the law calls "the highest and best
J60 0100  6    use" of centrally located urban land. As it affects
J60 0110  4    the city's fiscal situation, such an interchange is
J60 0120  1    ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property
J60 0120 10    which should be taxed to pay for the city services.
J60 0130  9    Subways improved land values without taking away land;
J60 0140  5    freeways boost valuation less (because the garages
J60 0150  2    they require are not prime buildings by a long shot),
J60 0150 12    and reduce the acreage that can be taxed. Downtown
J60 0160  8    Los Angeles is already two-thirds freeway, interchange,
J60 0170  5    street, parking lot and garage- one of those preposterous
J60 0180  4    "if" statistics has already come to pass.
J60 0190  1       The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates
J60 0190  8    and mitigates the access problem, but it also acts
J60 0200  9    inevitably as an artificial, isolating boundary. City
J60 0210  4    planners do not always use this boundary as effectively
J60 0220  3    as they might. Less ambitious freeway plans may be
J60 0230  1    more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges
J60 0230  9    are raised, allowing for cross access at many points
J60 0240  9    and providing parking areas below the ramp.
J60 0250  5    ##
J60 0250  6    Meanwhile, the automobile and its friend the truck
J60 0260  3    have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance.
J60 0270  1    In ever greater numbers, factories are locating in
J60 0270  9    the suburbs or in "industrial parks" removed from the
J60 0280  7    city's political jurisdiction. The appeal of the suburb
J60 0290  6    is particularly strong for heavy industry, which must
J60 0300  3    move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and
J60 0300 12    wants enough land area to do the entire job on one
J60 0310 11    floor. To light industry, the economies of being on
J60 0320  6    one floor are much slighter, but efficiency engineers
J60 0330  2    usually believe in them, and manufacturers looking
J60 0330  9    for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning
J60 0340 10    to efficiency engineers.
J60 0350  1       This movement of industry away from the central
J60 0350  9    cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets
J60 0360  9    seem to believe. It is merely the latest example of
J60 0370  7    the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually
J60 0380  3    all American cities. The big factories which are relatively
J60 0390  2    near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories
J60 0390 11    in Akron, Chrysler's Detroit plants, U.S.Steel's Pittsburgh
J60 0410  1    works- often began on these sites at a time when that
J60 0410 11    was the edge of the city, yet close to transport (river),
J60 0420 10    storage (piers) and power (river). The "leapfrog" was
J60 0430  6    a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine,
J60 0440  4    and the time when the belts of residence surrounding
J60 0450  1    the old factory area were not yet blighted.
J60 0450  9       The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new
J60 0460  8    degree of freedom in selecting his plant site. Until
J60 0470  4    internal combustion became cheap, he had to be near
J60 0480  1    a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing
J60 0480 11    large community of lower-class homes. The railroad
J60 0490  7    siding is still important- it is usually, though not
J60 0500  5    always, true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper
J60 0510  2    than trucking. But anybody who promises a substantial
J60 0510 10    volume of business can get a railroad to run a short
J60 0520 11    spur to his plant these days, and many businesses can
J60 0530  6    live without the railroad. And there are now many millions
J60 0540  5    of workers for whom the factory with the big parking
J60 0550  1    lot, which can be reached by driving across or against
J60 0550 11    the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route
J60 0560  9    bus lines, is actually more convenient than the walk-to
J60 0570  7    factory.
J60 0570  8       Willow Run, General Electric's enormous installations
J60 0580  4    at Louisville and Syracuse, the Pentagon, Boeing in
J60 0590  4    Seattle, Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles, the new
J60 0600  3    automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these
J60 0600 10    is substantially served by any sort of conventional
J60 0610  8    mass rapid transit. They are all suburban plants, relying
J60 0620  7    on the roads to keep them supplied with workers. And
J60 0630  4    wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined
J60 0640  2    by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry.
J60 0640 12    The drive along Massachusetts' Route 128, the by-pass
J60 0650  9    which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown
J60 0660  7    Boston, may be a vision of the future.
J60 0670  1       The future could be worse. The plants along Route
J60 0670 10    128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against
J60 0680  9    the New England rocks and trees. They can even be rather
J60 0690  8    grand, like Edward Land's monument to the astonishing
J60 0700  4    success of Polaroid. But they deny the values of the
J60 0710  3    city- the crowded, competitive, tolerant city, the
J60 0710 10    "melting pot" which gave off so many of the most admirable
J60 0720 11    American qualities. They are segregated businesses,
J60 0730  5    combining again on one site the factory and the office,
J60 0740  6    drawing their work force from segregated communities.
J60 0750  2    It is interesting to note how many of the plants on
J60 0750 13    Massachusetts' Route 128 draw most of their income
J60 0760  8    either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus
J60 0770  6    arrangements, or from the exploitation of patents which
J60 0780  4    grant at least a partial monopoly.
J60 0780 10    ##
J60 0780 11    While the factories were always the center of the labor
J60 0790 10    market, they were often on the city's periphery. In
J60 0800  7    spreading the factories even farther, the automobile
J60 0810  3    may not have changed to any great extent the growth
J60 0820  1    pattern of the cities. Even the loss of hotel business
J60 0820 11    to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless;
J60 0830  6    the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find
J60 0840  6    every year. What hurts most is the damage the automobile
J60 0850  3    has done to central-city retailing, especially in those
J60 0860  2    cities where public transit is feeble.
J60 0860  8       Some retailing, of course, always spreads with the
J60 0870  7    population- grocery stores, drugstores, local haberdasheries
J60 0880  3    and dress shops, candy stores and the like. But whenever
J60 0890  3    a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago-
J60 0890 11    a new bedroom set or a winter coat, an Easter bonnet,
J60 0900 11    a bicycle for Junior- the family set off for the downtown
J60 0910 10    department store, where the selection would be greatest.
J60 0920  5    Department stores congregated in the "one hundred per
J60 0930  4    cent location", where all the transit lines converged.
J60 0940  1    These stores are still there, but the volume of the
J60 0940 11    "downtown store" has been on a relative decline, while
J60 0950  9    in many cities the suburban "branch" sells more and
J60 0960  5    more dry goods. If the retailer and hotelman's downtown
J60 0970  3    unit sales have been decreasing, however, his dollar
J60 0980  1    volume continues to rise, and it is dollars which you
J60 0980 11    put in the bank.
J60 0990  2       In most discussions of this phenomenon, the figures
J60 0990 10    are substantially inflated. No suburban shopping-center
J60 1000  7    branch- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit-
J60 1010  6    does anything like the unit volume of business or carries
J60 1020  8    anything like the variety of merchandise to be found
J60 1030  4    in the home store. Telephone orders distort the picture:
J60 1040  2    the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than
J60 1040 10    a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement,
J60 1050  9    especially if the local call eliminates city sales
J60 1060  7    tax. The suburban branch is thereby credited with a
J60 1070  4    sale which would have been made even if its glass doors
J60 1080  2    had never opened. Accounting procedures which continue
J60 1080  9    to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse
J60 1090  6    expense to the main store make the branches seem more
J60 1100  6    profitable than they are. In many cases that statement
J60 1110  3    "We break even on our downtown operation and make money
J60 1120  1    on our branches" would be turned around if the cost
J60 1120 11    analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial
J60 1130  6    to the old store. Fear of the competition- always a
J60 1140  3    great motivating force in the American economy- makes
J60 1150  4    retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate
J60 1160  1    both the volume and the profitability of their rival's
J60 1160 10    shiny new branches. The fact seems to be that very
J60 1170  9    many large branch stores are uneconomical, that the
J60 1180  4    choice of location in the suburbs is as important as
J60 1190  2    it was downtown, and that even highly suburbanized
J60 1190 10    cities will support only so many big branches. Moreover,
J60 1200  8    the cost of operations is always high in any new store,
J60 1210  8    as the conservative bankers who act as controllers
J60 1220  4    for retail giants are beginning to discover.
J60 1230  1       When all has been said, however, the big branch
J60 1230 10    store remains a major break with history in the development
J60 1240  7    of American retailing. Just as the suburban factory
J60 1250  5    may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the
J60 1260  3    worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center
J60 1260 13    may seem far easier than to the downtown department
J60 1270  7    store, though both are the same distance from home.
J60 1280  4    Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban shopping
J60 1290  2    pulls customers who are geographically much nearer
J60 1290  9    to downtown. Raymond Vernon reports that residents
J60 1300  6    of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi,
J60 1310  7    through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to
J60 1320  6    the western suburbs for major shopping, simply because
J60 1330  2    parking is easier at the big branches than it is in
J60 1330 13    the heart of town. To the extent that the problem is
J60 1340 10    merely parking, an aggressive downtown management,
J60 1350  3    like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus, Ohio, can
J60 1360  3    fight back successfully by building a garage on the
J60 1360 12    lot next door. If the distant patron of the suburban
J60 1370 10    branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic
J60 1380  6    problems, however, the city store can only pressure
J60 1390  4    the politicians to do something about the highways
J60 1400  1    or await the completion of the federal highway program.
J60 1400 10    And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects
J60 1410  7    a desire to shop with "nice people", rather than with
J60 1420  5    the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown
J60 1430  3    department store, the central location may be in serious
J60 1440  1    trouble. Today, according to land economist Homer Hoyt,
J60 1440  9    shopping centers and their associated parking lots
J60 1450  7    cover some 46,000 acres of land, which is almost exactly
J60 1460  7    the total land area in all the nation's Central Business
J60 1470  3    Districts put together.
J60 1470  6       The downtown store continues to offer the great
J60 1480  7    inducement of variety, both within its gates and across
J60 1490  5    the street, where other department stores are immediately
J60 1500  1    convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is
J60 1500 11    available before making up her mind. If anything may
J60 1510  9    be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing,
J60 1520  4    it seems likely that the suburban branch will come
J60 1530  2    to dominate children's clothing (taking the kid downtown
J60 1530 10    is too much of a production), household gadgetry and
J60 1540  9    the discount business in big-ticket items. Department
J60 1550  6    stores were built on dry goods, especially ladies'
J60 1560  2    fashions, and in this area, in the long run, the suburban
J60 1570  1    branches will be hard put to compete against downtown.
J60 1570 10    If this analysis is correct, the suburban branches
J60 1580  7    will turn out to be what management's cost accountants
J60 1590  3    refuse to acknowledge, marginal operations rather than
J60 1600  3    major factors.
J60 1600  5       Historically in America the appeal of cities has
J60 1610  4    been their color and life, the variety of experience
J60 1620  1    they offered. "How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm"?
J60 1620 12    was a question that had to be asked long before they
J60 1630 11    saw Paree. Though Americans usually lived in groups
J60 1640  6    segregated by national origin or religious belief,
J60 1650  2    they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality
J60 1660  1    of downtown. Only a radical change in the nature of
J60 1660 11    the population in the central city would be likely
J60 1670  7    to destroy this preference- and we must now turn our
J60 1680  5    attention to the question of whether such a change,
J60 1690  1    gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians,
J60 1690  8    is actually upon us.
J60 1700  1    #4. SUBURBS AND NEGROES#
J60 1700  5    In their book American Skyline, Christopher Tunnard
J60 1710  3    and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's
J60 1720  1    New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility-
J60 1730  3    a fine ironical argument, when you consider how suburbanites
J60 1730 12    tend to vote. The first superhighways- New York's Henry
J60 1740  8    Hudson and Chicago's Lake Shore, San Francisco's Bay
J60 1750  6    Bridge and its approaches, a good slice of the Pennsylvania
J60 1760  7    Turnpike- were built as part of the federal works program
J60 1770  7    which was going to cure the depression. At the same
J60 1780  4    time, Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration, coupled
J60 1790  2    with Henry Morgenthau's cheap-money policy, permitted
J60 1800  1    ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their
J60 1800  9    own homes. Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without
J60 1810  8    better security than the house itself got that security
J60 1820  5    from the U. S. government; householders who had been
J60 1830  4    unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest
J60 1840  1    mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years
J60 1840 10    at 4 per cent, under government aegis.
