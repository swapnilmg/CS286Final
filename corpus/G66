G66 0010  1    Stephens had written his classic "incidents of travel"
G66 0010  9    about these regions a hundred years before, and Catherwood,
G66 0020  8    who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins
G66 0030  7    of Egypt and Greece, had drawn the splendid illustrations
G66 0040  4    that accompanied the text. Catherwood, an architect
G66 0050  2    in New York, had been forgotten, like Stephens, and
G66 0050 11    Victor reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs,
G66 0060  7    for a museum, a dinosaur from two or three petrified
G66 0070  6    bones. He had unearthed Stephens's letters in a New
G66 0080  5    Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens's unmarked
G66 0090  2    grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York,
G66 0090 14    where the great traveller had been hastily buried during
G66 0100  9    a cholera epidemic. Victor had been stirred by my account
G66 0110  8    of him in Makers and Finders, for Stephens was one
G66 0120  5    of the lost writers whom Melville had seen in his childhood
G66 0130  4    and whom I was bent on resurrecting.
G66 0130 11       Victor had led an adventurous life. His metier was
G66 0140  9    the American tropics, and he had lived all over Latin
G66 0150  8    America and among the primitive tribes on the Amazon
G66 0160  5    river. Well he knew the sleepless nights, the howling
G66 0170  1    sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages
G66 0170 11    of the Kofanes and Huitotoes. He had not yet undertaken
G66 0180  9    the great exploit of his later years, the rediscovery
G66 0190  7    of the ancient Inca highway, the route of Pizarro in
G66 0200  5    Peru, but he had climbed to the original El Dorado,
G66 0210  1    the Andean lake of Guatemala, and he had scaled the
G66 0210 11    southern Sierra Nevada with its Tibetan-like people
G66 0220  7    and looked into the emerald mines of Muzo. As a naturalist
G66 0230  7    living for two years at the headwaters of the Amazon,
G66 0240  4    he had collected specimens for Mexican museums, and
G66 0250  2    he had taken to the London zoo a live quetzal, the
G66 0250 13    sacred bird of the old Mayans. In fact, he had raised
G66 0260  9    quetzal birds in his camp in the forest of Ecuador.
G66 0270  5    Moreover, he had spent six months on the Galapagos
G66 0280  1    islands, among the great turtles that Captain Cook
G66 0280  9    had found there, and now and then he would disappear
G66 0290  9    into some small island of the West Indies. Victor's
G66 0300  5    book on John Lloyd Stephens was largely written in
G66 0310  3    my study in the house at Weston.
G66 0310 10       I had had my name taken out of the telephone book,
G66 0320  8    and this was partly because of a convict who had been
G66 0330  6    discharged from Sing Sing and who called me night after
G66 0340  2    night. He said he was a friend of Heywood Broun who
G66 0340 13    had run a free employment bureau for several months
G66 0350  9    during the depression, but the generous Broun to whom
G66 0360  7    I wrote did not know his name and I somehow conceived
G66 0370  3    the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling
G66 0380  1    round the house. But one day came the voice of a man
G66 0380 13    I had known when he was a boy, and I later remembered
G66 0390 10    that this boy, thirty years before, had struck me as
G66 0400  6    coming to no good. There had been something sinister
G66 0410  2    about him that warned me against him,- I had never
G66 0410 12    felt that way about any other boy,- but when he uttered
G66 0420 11    his name on the telephone I had forgotten this and
G66 0430  7    I was glad to do what he asked of me. He was a captain,
G66 0440  6    he said, in the army, and on the train to New York
G66 0450  2    his purse and all his money had been stolen, and would
G66 0450 13    I lend him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the
G66 0460 11    General Delivery window? Never hearing from him again,
G66 0470  6    I remembered the little boy of whom I had had such
G66 0480  5    doubts when he was ten years old. We lived for a while
G66 0490  2    in a movie melodrama with a German cook and her son
G66 0490 13    who turned out to be Nazis. Finally we got them out
G66 0500 10    of the house, after the boy had run away four times
G66 0510  6    looking for other Nazis, threatening to murder village
G66 0520  2    schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next
G66 0520 12    Fu^hrer. Then he began to have epileptic fits. We found
G66 0530 10    that a charitable society in New York had a long case-history
G66 0540 10    of the two; and they agreed to see that the tragic
G66 0550  8    pair would not put poison in anybody else's soup.
G66 0560  3       To the Weston house came once William Allen Neilson,
G66 0570  2    the president of Smith College who had been one of
G66 0570 12    my old professors and who still called me "Boy" when
G66 0580  9    I was sixty. It reminded me of my other professor,
G66 0590  7    Edward Kennard Rand, of whom I had been so fond when
G66 0600  6    I was at Harvard, the great mediaevalist and classical
G66 0610  2    scholar who had asked me to call him "Ken", saying,
G66 0610 12    "Age counts for nothing among those who have learned
G66 0620  9    to know life sub specie aeternitatis". I had always
G66 0630  6    thought of that lovable man as many years older than
G66 0640  6    myself, although he was perhaps only twenty years older,
G66 0650  3    and he confirmed my feeling, along with the feeling
G66 0650 12    of both my sons, that teachers of the classics are
G66 0660  9    invariably endearing. I must have written to say how
G66 0670  7    much I had enjoyed his fine book The Building of Eternal
G66 0690  3    Rome, and I found he had not regretted giving me the
G66 0700  3    highest mark in his old course on the later Latin poets,
G66 0700 14    although in my final examination I had ignored the
G66 0720  9    questions and filled the bluebook with a comparison
G66 0730  5    of Propertius and Coleridge. He had written to me about
G66 0740  4    a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St.
G66 0750  1    Anselm's Priory in Washington. There had been reading
G66 0750  9    at table, especially from two books, Pope Gregory the
G66 0760  8    Great's account of St. Scholastica in his Dialogues
G66 0770  7    and my own The World of Washington Irving. He said,
G66 0780  6    "Some have criticized your book as being neither literary
G66 0800  4    criticism nor history. Of course it was not meant to
G66 0810  3    be. Some have felt that Washington Irving comes out
G66 0810 12    rather slimly, but let them look at the title of the
G66 0820 11    book". He felt as I felt about this best of all my
G66 0830  9    books, that it was "really tops".
G66 0840  1       Two or three times, C. C. Burlingham came to lunch
G66 0840 11    with us in Weston, that wonderful man who lived to
G66 0850 10    be more than a hundred years old and whose birthplace
G66 0860  6    had been my Wall Street suburb. His reading ranged
G66 0870  3    from Agatha Christie to the Book of Job and he had
G66 0880  1    an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures, while
G66 0880  9    his letters were full of gossip about new politicians
G66 0890  7    and old men of letters with whom he had been intimately
G66 0900  5    thrown six decades before. I could never forget the
G66 0910  2    gaiety with which, when he was both blind and deaf,
G66 0910 12    he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some
G66 0920 10    of the pictures; and once when he came to see us in
G66 0930  8    New York he walked away in a rainstorm, unwilling to
G66 0940  3    hear of a taxi or even an umbrella, although he was
G66 0940 14    at the time ninety years old. There were several men
G66 0950  9    of ninety or more whom I knew first or last, all of
G66 0960  8    whom were still productive and most of whom knew one
G66 0970  4    another as if they had naturally come together at the
G66 0970 14    apex of their lives. I never met John Dewey, whose
G66 0980 10    style was a sort of verbal fog and who had written
G66 0990  8    asking me to go to Mexico with him when he was investigating
G66 1000  5    the cause of Trotsky; but I liked to think of him at
G66 1010  4    ninety swimming and working at Key West long after
G66 1010 13    Hemingway had moved to Cuba. At Lee Simonson's house,
G66 1020  9    I had dined with Edith Hamilton, the nonogenarian rationalist
G66 1030  7    and the charming scholar who had a great popular success
G66 1040  7    with The Greek Way. Then there was Mark Howe and there
G66 1050  7    was Henry Dwight Sedgwick, an accomplished man of letters
G66 1060  4    who wrote in the spirit of Montaigne and produced in
G66 1070  2    the end a formidable body of work. I saw Sedgwick often
G66 1070 13    before his death at ninety-five,- he had remarried
G66 1080  9    at the age of ninety,- and he asked me, when once I
G66 1090 10    returned from Rome, if I knew the Cavallinis in the
G66 1100  4    church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere. I had to confess
G66 1110  2    that I had missed these frescoes, recently discovered,
G66 1110 10    that he had studied in his eighties. Sedgwick had chosen
G66 1120 10    to follow the philosophy of Epicurus whom, with his
G66 1130  6    followers, Dante put in hell; but he defended the doctrine
G66 1140  5    in The Art of Happiness, and what indeed could be said
G66 1150  4    against the Epicurean virtues, health, frugality, privacy,
G66 1160  2    culture and friendship? Of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe
G66 1170  1    the philosopher Whitehead said the Earth's first visitors
G66 1170  9    to Mars should be persons likely to make a good impression,
G66 1180 10    and when he was asked, "Whom would you send"? he replied,
G66 1200  8    "My first choice would be Mark Howe". This friend of
G66 1210  8    many years came once to visit us in the house at Weston.
G66 1220  7    Then I spoke at the ninetieth birthday party of W.
G66 1230  4    E. Burghardt Du Bois, who embarked on a fictional trilogy
G66 1240  2    at eighty-nine and who, with The Crisis, had created
G66 1240 12    a Negro intelligentsia that had never existed in America
G66 1250  9    before him. As their interpreter and guide, he had
G66 1260  7    broken with Tuskegee and become a spokesman of the
G66 1270  5    coloured people of the world.
G66 1270 10       Mr. Burlingham,- "C.C.B."- wrote to me once about
G66 1280  9    an old friend of mine, S. K. Ratcliffe, whom I had
G66 1290  9    first met in London in 1914 and who also came out for
G66 1300  8    a week-end in Weston. "Did you ever know a man with
G66 1310  5    greater zest for information? And his memory, like
G66 1320  1    an elephant's, stored with precise knowledge of men
G66 1320  9    and things and happenings". His wife, Katie, "as gay
G66 1330  7    as a lark and as lively as a gazelle",- she was then
G66 1340  7    seventy-six,- had a "a sense of humour that has been
G66 1350  4    denied S.K., but neither has any aesthetic perceptions.
G66 1360  1    People and books are enough for them". S.K. was visiting
G66 1370  1    C.C.B. and, not waiting for breakfast, he was off to
G66 1380  1    the University Club, where he spent hours writing obituaries
G66 1380 10    of living Americans for the Manchester guardian or
G66 1390  7    the Glasgow Herald. Later, rising ninety, he was beset
G66 1400  7    by publishers for the story of his life and miracles,
G66 1410  6    as he put it, but, calling himself the Needy Knife-grinder,
G66 1420  3    he had spent his time writing short articles and long
G66 1430  1    letters and could not get even a small popular book
G66 1430 11    done. Then, all but blind, he said there was nothing
G66 1440  8    in Back to Methuselah,- "G.B.S. ought to have known
G66 1450  6    that",- and "I look at my bookshelves despairingly,
G66 1460  3    knowing that I can have nothing more to do with them".
G66 1470  3    However, at eighty-five, he had still been busy writing
G66 1480  1    articles, reviewing and speaking, and I had never before
G66 1480 10    known an Englishman who had visited and lectured in
G66 1490  8    three quarters of the United States. Finally, colleges
G66 1500  4    and clubs took the line that speakers from England
G66 1510  3    were not wanted any longer, even speakers like S.K.,
G66 1520  1    so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized
G66 1520 10    the Americans for many years. With their facile generalizations
G66 1530  8    about the United States, these mediocrities, as they
G66 1540  6    often were, had been great successes. While S.K. did
G66 1550  4    not like Dylan Thomas, I liked his poems very much,
G66 1560  3    but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so,
G66 1560 13    whereupon he said to me, "I suppose you think you know
G66 1570 11    all about me". I should have replied, "I probably know
G66 1580  8    something about the best part of you". But I only thought
G66 1590  8    of that in the middle of the night.
G66 1600  1       Many years later I went to see S.K. in England,
G66 1600 11    where he was living at Whiteleaf, near Aylesbury, and
G66 1620  9    he showed me beside his cottage there the remains of
G66 1630  7    the road on which Boadicea is supposed to have travelled.
G66 1640  4    He was convinced that George Orwell's 1984 was nearly
G66 1650  3    all wrong as it applied to England, which was "driving
G66 1660  1    forward into uncharted waters", with the danger of
G66 1660  9    a new tyranny ahead. "But however we go, whatever our
G66 1670  8    doom, it will not take the Orwellian shape". With facts
G66 1680  5    mainly in his mind, he was often acute in the matter
G66 1690  4    of style, and he said, "The young who have as yet nothing
G66 1700  2    to say will try larks with initial letters and broken
G66 1700 12    lines. But put them before a situation which they are
G66 1710 10    forced to depict",- he was speaking of the Spanish
G66 1720  9    civil war,- "and they have no hesitation; they merely
G66 1730  3    do their best to make it real for others".
