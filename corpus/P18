P18 0010  1    She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that
P18 0010 13    night. "Shirley appreciated the chance to make some
P18 0020  7    money. Such a nice little thing- lives right in the
P18 0030  7    building".
P18 0030  8       "That's swell", I said sweetly. I could get along
P18 0040  7    without that three dollars. In some ways it was worth
P18 0050  5    being out the money- just knowing I was no longer obligated
P18 0060  2    to Nadine!
P18 0060  4       It was past midnight and we were in bed when the
P18 0070  4    phone rang. I stumbled through the hall, wondering
P18 0070 12    who would be calling at this hour. I answered to find
P18 0080 10    Nadine at the other end. "You scared me half to death",
P18 0090  8    I said shakily. "What's wrong"?
P18 0100  2       "Janice, nobody answers at the apartment"! Her voice
P18 0110  3    came shrill. "I'm absolutely frantic! That stupid girl
P18 0120  1    might have gone off and left Francie"!
P18 0120  8       "Oh, she wouldn't do that", I said. "She's probably
P18 0130  7    fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone. But if you're
P18 0140  7    worried you can go home and check"-
P18 0150  3       "I can't leave the party! We're at Ken Thom's apartment,
P18 0160  2    and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat!
P18 0170  1    Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally, and we simply
P18 0170 12    can't afford to get Ken mad at us"-
P18 0180  8       I was all set for what came next. "Janice, could
P18 0190  5    you possibly go over and make sure everything's all
P18 0200  2    right? I'll call you there in ten minutes"-
P18 0210  1       "I can't make it in ten minutes"- Wondering, as
P18 0210 10    I said it, why I should make it at all. Why should
P18 0220 10    I go over at midnight to check on Francie, when her
P18 0230  6    parents didn't care enough to leave a party?
P18 0240  1       "Fifteen minutes, then! Please, Janice. I'll be
P18 0250  2    glad to pay you"-
P18 0250  6       So sure that money could do anything! "All right",
P18 0260  3    I said. I'd do it. Not for the dollar or so Nadine
P18 0270  2    would give me. But because there was the chance that
P18 0270 12    something had gone wrong at the apartment, and if I
P18 0280 10    didn't go over, who would?
P18 0290  1    ##
P18 0290  2    @ CHRIS WAS sound asleep, and I didn't see any sense
P18 0300  2    in waking him. I dressed in the kitchen, then left
P18 0300 12    a note on the table telling him what had happened.
P18 0310  7    I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment
P18 0320  5    and rang the bell, and in a few seconds a young girl
P18 0330  4    opened the door. Her face was flushed from sleep. "It's
P18 0340  1    all right", I said, as she started to look scared.
P18 0340 11    "Mrs. Roberts had called, and couldn't wake you. I
P18 0350  9    just came over to make sure everything was all right".
P18 0360  7       "I'm- hard to wake up", she faltered. She didn't
P18 0370  6    look over thirteen. And Nadine insisted that her sitters
P18 0380  5    be reliable! "I have to get up early for church tomorrow",
P18 0390  4    she went on. "I didn't know it was going to be this
P18 0400  4    late"!
P18 0400  5       The phone started ringing. "That's Mrs. Roberts
P18 0410  3    again", I said. "I'll answer it". I crossed the beautifully
P18 0420  3    furnished living room to the pale yellow phone. I told
P18 0430  1    Nadine everything was fine, and that I'd be getting
P18 0430 10    on home.
P18 0440  1       "Janice, would you mind staying"? There was a ragged
P18 0440 10    edge to her voice now, as if she'd been crying. "Wally's
P18 0450 11    drunk- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly
P18 0460 12    can, but I don't want Shirley to see him like this.
P18 0470  8    You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an
P18 0480  4    apartment building"-
P18 0480  6       Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done.
P18 0490  6    The receiver clicked in my ear. She didn't even give
P18 0500  4    me a chance to refuse. Well, there wasn't any law that
P18 0510  3    said I had to stay! But then I looked at Shirley and
P18 0510 15    thought that I might as well- the child needed her
P18 0520 10    sleep, and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would
P18 0530  9    be, with Wally coming home drunk. So I told her Mrs.
P18 0540  6    Roberts would pay her in the morning, and she scooted
P18 0550  2    off to her own apartment.
P18 0550  7       After I looked in at Francie, I went into the living
P18 0560  6    room and waited. I must have dozed off, because I came
P18 0570  4    to with a start at the sound of voices. Nadine's, shrill
P18 0580  1    with anger- Wally's loud and thick- As I went to the
P18 0580 12    door I heard the clock strike two. I opened the door,
P18 0590 11    and Wally stumbled in- fast- as if Nadine had pushed
P18 0600  6    him.
P18 0600  7       I had always thought she was so beautiful. But now
P18 0610  7    she looked ugly. Her skin was stretched so tight that
P18 0620  4    her cheekbones stuck out, and if looks could kill,
P18 0630  1    Wally would have been dead. "Pack your clothes", she
P18 0630 10    hissed. "Pack- and get out"!
P18 0640  4       "You're crazy", Wally said thickly. He lurched and
P18 0650  5    stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it, and
P18 0660  3    was instantly asleep. Nadine strode over to him, and
P18 0660 12    her pointed nails raked across his face. I grabbed
P18 0670  8    her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second
P18 0680  7    I thought that maybe Wally was right, and she was crazy.
P18 0690  4       "You stay out of this", she spat at me. "He's ruined
P18 0700  3    us- do you hear me- he's ruined us! He insulted Ken
P18 0710  2    Thom"! Her eyes were wild. "He told Ken to his face
P18 0720  1    that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman!
P18 0720 12    And the other people there were listening! We're ruined
P18 0730  7    and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down
P18 0740 10    the stairs"-
P18 0740 12    ##
P18 0740 13    @ "YOU'D BETTER simmer down", I said nervously. I was
P18 0750  9    plenty scared. In the state she was in, she could actually
P18 0760 10    kill him! "Now you just take it easy, and I'll make
P18 0770  9    you some tea"-
P18 0780  1       "Tea," Nadine screeched. "How can you be so damn
P18 0780  9    stupid? Wally's lost his job! Ken will never forgive
P18 0790  9    him- never! And we don't have any money- we don't have
P18 0810  8    a dime! All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the
P18 0820  5    televison-record player and we even owe on them. And
P18 0830  4    we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house
P18 0840  1    like yours- and all because of that"-
P18 0840  8       I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream
P18 0850  8    of filth. "Stop that! You'll wake up the whole building.
P18 0860  6    Wally can't go any place at this hour"-
P18 0870  3       "Well then, I'll get out"- But she looked uncertain.
P18 0880  2    She was coming to her senses enough to realize that
P18 0880 12    you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning.
P18 0890 10       "You go to bed", I said curtly. "In the morning
P18 0900 10    you and Wally can talk things out"-
P18 0910  3       She collapsed against me, as if everything inside
P18 0920  2    her snapped. I got her into bed, and sat with her until
P18 0920 14    she had sobbed herself out. It was three o'clock before
P18 0930  9    I figured it was all right to go. I left her, a limp
P18 0940 10    bundle of self-pity, shivering with terror because
P18 0950  4    her bubble had burst around her. Wally was snoring
P18 0960  1    on the davenport. I had done all I could. I had done
P18 0960 13    all I was going to do. Whether or not Wally lost his
P18 0970  9    job was no concern of mine. I drove home, found Chris
P18 0980  6    still asleep. I snuggled up close to him- loving him-
P18 0990  5    thankful for a man like him. Thankful I wasn't Nadine.
P18 1000  2       I kept on being thankful. In the afternoon Nadine
P18 1000 11    and Wally came over with Francie. Wally sat in our
P18 1010 10    big chair, his hands between his knees, looking ready
P18 1020  6    to cry. "I'd had all this trouble with the old man,
P18 1030  5    that's why I drank so much. I- got fired yesterday
P18 1040  2    for not attending to business"-
P18 1040  7       Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service
P18 1050  7    station for a grease job, Wally confessed, and couldn't
P18 1060  4    get one because there were cars on the pits waiting
P18 1070  2    to be repaired. Seems that the kid Wally had hired
P18 1070 12    had a repair business of his own going on the side.
P18 1080  9    Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone, and fired him.
P18 1090  7    "I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken", Wally
P18 1100  4    said miserably. "But Ken got coy and wouldn't make
P18 1110  2    any promises. And I was plastered and I blew my stack"-
P18 1120  3       "And told him right to his face he'd never slept
P18 1120 13    with a woman"! I tried to quiet Nadine because the
P18 1130 10    children were there. But she was beyond caring what
P18 1140  7    she said.
P18 1140  9       "Things may smooth over yet", Chris said, his nice
P18 1150  8    lean face grave with honest concern. But I couldn't
P18 1160  5    help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just
P18 1170  3    what they deserved. Now maybe they'd realize that life
P18 1180  1    can be tough.
P18 1180  4    ##
P18 1180  5    @ WHEN A bubble breaks, there's nothing. Little by
P18 1190  3    little, during the week, Chris and I discovered the
P18 1190 12    crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived.
P18 1200  8    They had not only spent every cent- they were in debt
P18 1210  8    up to their necks, owing on everything they owned.
P18 1220  3       On top of everything else they were two months behind
P18 1230  2    on their apartment rent, and the day Wally received
P18 1230 11    written notice that he was fired, they were evicted.
P18 1240  9       Worst of all, Wally had no training for any kind
P18 1250  8    of work. He had fallen into a soft job, and now the
P18 1260  5    job was gone and he was stranded.
P18 1260 12       Chris fretted. "I wish we were in a position to
P18 1270  9    offer a little money to tide them over".
P18 1280  3       I said I wished we were, too. It was easy enough
P18 1290  1    to say it, because of course we couldn't spare a cent.
P18 1290 12    But Chris brightened up like a candle. "I'm glad you
P18 1300  9    feel that way, honey. There is one big way we can help
P18 1310  9    them. We can let them move in with us"-
P18 1320  3       Something I had simply never thought of. Something
P18 1330  1    so incredible-
P18 1330  3       I just stared at him. It was incredible- He gave
P18 1340  5    me an embarrassed, pleading look. "I know we'd be pretty
P18 1350  2    crowded. But it would only be for a couple of weeks-
P18 1350 13    until they get straightened out".
P18 1360  4       Straightened out- They'd had years of making all
P18 1370  5    that money! "I won't do it", I said flatly. "Nadine
P18 1380  2    was always too good to live in a little house like
P18 1380 13    this! Well, now she can sleep in the street for all
P18 1390 11    I care"!
P18 1400  1       "That isn't like you, Janice", Chris said uncomfortably.
P18 1410  1    Then I felt uncomfortable, too. I didn't want to be
P18 1410 11    like that, mean and bitter. But, darn it all, why should
P18 1420  9    we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down
P18 1430  6    their noses at us?
P18 1430 10       But, in the end, we did. It just seemed as if there
P18 1440 11    was nothing else to do. The finance company took all
P18 1450  6    their furniture- and they didn't have a cent to their
P18 1460  6    name.
P18 1460  7       Then Wally got sick. To my way of thinking, he was
P18 1470  4    scared sick. His luck had failed him, and it was easier
P18 1480  1    to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the
P18 1480 13    world.
P18 1490  1       Chris made trip after trip in our old car, moving
P18 1490 10    the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine
P18 1500  7    had bought on special. At least we'll eat, I thought
P18 1510  5    grimly as I put all the food away.
P18 1520  1       While I worked, Nadine sat and cried. When she wasn't
P18 1520 11    crying, she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally.
P18 1530  8    "Virus infection nothing", she'd scream at him. "You're
P18 1540  5    too lazy to go out and look for another job. You're
P18 1550  4    just a no-good bum"!
P18 1550  9       It was a mess, all right. But it couldn't go on
P18 1560  8    forever- A couple of weeks, Chris had said. I figured
P18 1570  6    I could stand practically anything for a couple of
P18 1580  3    weeks.
P18 1580  4       But the two weeks dragged into three, and they were
P18 1590  2    still with us. Nadine's constant nagging had finally
P18 1590 10    gotten Wally out of bed. He set out every morning looking
P18 1600 11    for work, and come home around noon, full of alibis
P18 1610  7    and excuses. Wendell Thom had black-balled him. Nobody
P18 1620  3    would even take his application.
P18 1620  8       "You can get something," Nadine would snap. "You
P18 1630  8    can get a job working in a grocery store, if nothing
P18 1640  7    else".
P18 1640  8       "The high school kids have got everything sewed
P18 1650  6    up", he said, a whine in his voice. "Those damn punks-
P18 1660  4    taking work away from men who need it".
P18 1670  1    ##
P18 1670  1    @ "BY FALL they'll be back in school", I'd say, trying
P18 1680  2    to sound encouraging. But this was only the middle
P18 1680 11    of July ...
P18 1690  1       And I couldn't take six more weeks of this. I mentioned
P18 1700  1    it to Chris one stifling hot night, when I had slipped
P18 1700 12    outside for a breath of fresh air.
