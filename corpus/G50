G50 0010  1       As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year
G50 0010 12    and a half before, Lewis trekked southeast through
G50 0020  6    Red Russia to Kamieniec. Thence he pushed farther south
G50 0030  6    than he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay
G50 0040  3    Tartary or the Yedisan. There, along the east bank
G50 0050  1    of the Southern Bug, opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli
G50 0050 10    a few miles north of the Black Sea, he arrived at General
G50 0060 10    Headquarters of the Russian Army. By June 19, 1788,
G50 0070  7    he had presented himself to its Commander in Chief,
G50 0080  3    the Governor of the Southern Provinces, the Director
G50 0090  1    of the War College- The Prince.
G50 0090  7    ##
G50 0090  8    Catherine's first war against the Grand Turk had ended
G50 0100  8    in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her.
G50 0110  5    By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the Crimea
G50 0120  2    amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now, in this second
G50 0120 12    combat with the Crescent, were aiming at suzerainty
G50 0130  7    over all of the Black Sea's northern shoreline.
G50 0140  3       Through most of 1787 operations on both sides had
G50 0150  4    been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove
G50 0160  1    decisive, though many of their details are obscure.
G50 0160  9    To consolidate what her Navy had won, the Czarina was
G50 0170  8    fortunate that, for the first time in Russian history,
G50 0180  5    her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under
G50 0190  2    her favorite Giaour. Potemkin was directing this conflict
G50 0200  1    on three fronts: in the Caucasus; along the Danube
G50 0200 10    and among the Carpathians, in alliance with the Emperor
G50 0210  7    Joseph's armies; and in the misty marshlands and shallow
G50 0220  7    coastal waters of Nogay Tartary and Taurida, including
G50 0230  4    the Crimean peninsula. Here the war would flame to
G50 0240  3    its focus, and here Lewis Littlepage had come.
G50 0240 11       Potemkin's Army of Ekaterinoslav, totaling, it was
G50 0260  7    claimed, 40,000 regular troops and 6,000 irregulars
G50 0270  5    of the Cossack Corps, had invested Islam's principal
G50 0280  3    stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea, the
G50 0290  2    fortress town of Oczakov, and was preparing to test
G50 0290 11    the Turk by land and sea. During a sojourn of slightly
G50 0300  9    more than three months Chamberlain Littlepage sould
G50 0310  3    see action on both elements.
G50 0310  8       As his second in command The Prince had Marshal
G50 0320  8    Repnin, one-time Ambassador to Poland. Repnin, who
G50 0330  5    had a rather narrow face, longish nose, high forehead,
G50 0340  3    and arching brows, looked like a quizzical Mephistopheles.
G50 0350  1    Some people thought he lacked both ability and character,
G50 0350 10    but most agreed that he was noble in appearance and,
G50 0370  9    for a Russian, humane. The Marshal came to know Littlepage
G50 0380  7    quite well. At General Headquarters the newcomer in
G50 0390  4    turn got to know others. There was the Neapolitan,
G50 0400  1    Ribas, a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith
G50 0410  1    but who had fawned his way up the ladder of Catherine's
G50 0410 12    and Potemkin's favor till he was now a brigadier (and
G50 0420  9    would one day be the daggerman designated to do in
G50 0430  5    Czar Paul I, after traveling all the way to Naples
G50 0450  3    to procure just the right stiletto).
G50 0450  9       Then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers.
G50 0460  5    Representing the Emperor were the Prince de Ligne,
G50 0470  5    still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and General
G50 0480  2    the Count Pallavicini, founder of the Austrian branch
G50 0480 10    of that celebrated Italian house, a courtier Littlepage
G50 0490  8    could have met at Madrid in December, 1780. From Milan
G50 0500  8    came the young Chevalier de Litta, an officer in the
G50 0510  7    service of Malta. Out of Saxony rode the Prince of
G50 0520  4    Anhalt-Bernburg, one of the Czarina's cousins and a
G50 0530  2    lieutenant general in her armies, a frank, sensitive,
G50 0530 10    popular soldier whose kindnesses Littlepage would "always
G50 0540  6    recall with the sincerest gratitude".
G50 0550  2       Though Catherine was vexed at the number of French
G50 0560  2    officers streaming to the Turkish standard, there were
G50 0560 10    several under her own, such as the Prince de Nassau;
G50 0570 10    the energetic Parisian, Roger de Damas, three year's
G50 0580  6    Littlepage's junior, to whom Nassau had taken a liking;
G50 0590  6    and the artillerist, Colonel Prevost, whom the Count
G50 0600  4    de Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills
G50 0610  1    to Nassau. England contributed a young subaltern named
G50 0610  9    Newton and the naval architect Samuel Bentham, brother
G50 0620  7    to the economist, who far his colonel's commission
G50 0630  4    was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet. From America
G50 0640  3    were the Messrs. Littlepage and Jones.
G50 0650  1       Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's
G50 0650 10    and Nassau's naval command post. On arrival at headquarters
G50 0660  7    he had, however- in King Stanislas' words to Glayre-
G50 0670  5    "found such favor with Pe Potemkin that he made him
G50 0680  6    his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want him to
G50 0690  3    go join Paul Jones ...". So of course he stayed put.
G50 0690 14    Having done so, he began to experience all the frustrations
G50 0700 10    of others who attempted to get along with Serenissimus
G50 0710  7    and do a job at the same time.
G50 0720  2       The Prince's perceptions were quick and his energy
G50 0720 10    monstrous, but these qualities were sapped by an Oriental
G50 0730  9    lethargy and a policy of letting nothing interfere
G50 0740  7    with personal passions. At headquarters- sufficiently
G50 0750  4    far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally
G50 0760  1    that you were in a war- Lewis found that the Commander
G50 0770  1    in Chief's only desk was his knees (and his only comb,
G50 0770 12    his fingers). An entire theater had been set up for
G50 0780  9    his diversion, with a 200-man Italian orchestra under
G50 0790  4    the well-known Sarti. In the great one's personal quarters,
G50 0800  3    a portable house, almost every evening saw an elegant
G50 0810  1    banquet or reception. Lewis could let his eye caress
G50 0810 10    The Prince's divan, covered with a rose-pink and silver
G50 0820  9    Turkish cloth, or admire the lovely tapis, interwoven
G50 0830  5    with gold, that spread across the floor. Filigreed
G50 0840  2    perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby. Around the
G50 0850  1    billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen
G50 0850 11    beribboned generals. At dinner the courses were carried
G50 0860  7    in by tall cuirassiers in red capes and black fur caps
G50 0870  6    topped with tufts of feathers, marching in pairs like
G50 0880  3    guards from a stage tragedy.
G50 0880  8       Among the visitors arriving every now and then there
G50 0890  6    were, of course, women. For if Serenissimus made the
G50 0900  3    sign of the Cross with his right hand, and meant it,
G50 0910  1    with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened
G50 0910 12    to catch his eye. Usually Lewis would find at headquarters
G50 0920  8    one or more of The Prince's various nieces.
G50 0930  4       Right now he found Sophie de Witt, that magnificent
G50 0940  3    young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec fours years
G50 0950  1    ago. The Prince took her with him on every tour around
G50 0950 12    the area, and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge
G50 0960 10    of Constantinople as part of his espionage network.
G50 0970  7    One evening he passed around the banquet table a crystal
G50 0980  4    cup full of diamonds, requesting every female guest
G50 0990  1    to select one as a souvenir. When a lady chanced to
G50 0990 12    soil a pair of evening slippers, Brigadier Bauer was
G50 1000  6    dispatched to Paris for replacements.
G50 1010  1       But if The Prince fancied women and was fascinated
G50 1020  1    by foreigners, he could be haughtiness personified
G50 1020  8    to his subordinates. He had collared one of his generals
G50 1030  8    in public. His coat trimmed in sable, diamond stars
G50 1040  5    of the Orders of Saints Andrew or George agleam, he
G50 1050  2    was often prone to sit sulkily, eye downcast, in a
G50 1050 12    Scheherazade trance. When this happened, everything
G50 1060  6    stopped. As Littlepage noted: "A complete picture of
G50 1070  6    Prince Potemkin may be had in his 1788 operations.
G50 1080  3    He stays inactive for half the summer in front of Oczakov,
G50 1090  1    a quite second-rate spot, begins to besiege it formally
G50 1090 11    only during the autumn rains, and finally carries it
G50 1100  9    by assault in the heart of winter. There's a man who
G50 1110  9    never goes by the ordinary road but still arrives at
G50 1120  5    his goal, who gratuitously gets himself into difficulty
G50 1130  2    in order to get out of it with eclat, in a word a man
G50 1130 16    who creates monsters for himself in order to appear
G50 1140  8    a Hercules in destroying them".
G50 1150  2       To help him do so The Prince had conferred control
G50 1160  1    of his land forces on a soldier who was different from
G50 1160 12    him in almost every respect save one: both were eccentrics
G50 1170  8    of the purest ray serene.
G50 1180  2       Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov, now in his fifty-ninth
G50 1190  1    year (ten years Potemkin's senior), was a thin, worn-faced
G50 1190 11    person of less than medium height who looked like a
G50 1200 10    professor of botany. He had a small mouth with deep
G50 1210  7    furrows on either side, a large flat nose, and penetrating
G50 1220  3    blue eyes. His gray hair was thin, his face beginning
G50 1230  1    to attract a swarm of wrinkles. He was ugly. But Suvorov's
G50 1230 12    face was also a theater of vivacity, and his tough,
G50 1240 10    stooping little frame was briskness embodied. Like
G50 1250  5    all Russians he was an emotional man, and in him the
G50 1260  5    emotions warred. Kind by nature, he never refused charity
G50 1270  1    to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it
G50 1270 13    (as Lewis would one day discover). But he was perpetually
G50 1280  8    engaged in a battle to command his own temper.
G50 1290  5       When Littlepage was introduced, if the General behaved
G50 1300  3    as usual, the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries:
G50 1310  1    origin? age? mission? current status? Woe betide the
G50 1320  1    interviewee if he answered vaguely. Suvorov's contempt
G50 1320  8    for don't-know's was proverbial; better to give an
G50 1330  7    asinine answer than none at all. Despising luxuries
G50 1340  5    of any sort for a soldier, he slept on a pile of hay
G50 1350  4    with his cloak as blanket. He rose at 4:00 A.M. the
G50 1360  1    year round and was apt to stride through camp crowing
G50 1370  8    like a cock to wake his men. His breakfast was tea;
G50 1380  7    his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon; his supper
G50 1390  5    was nothing. He hadn't worn a watch or carried pocket
G50 1400  2    money for years because he disliked both, but highest
G50 1400 11    among his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched
G50 1410  9    one from an officer's grasp and smashed it to smithereens.
G50 1420  7    He kept several pet birds and liked cats well enough
G50 1430  6    that if one crept by, he would mew at it in friendly
G50 1440  2    fashion. Passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark.
G50 1440 11       Yet General Suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing
G50 1450  9    his adored Czarina declare that all truly great men
G50 1460  8    had oddities- was mad only north, northwest. He had
G50 1470  6    come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity allowed
G50 1480  2    mere field officers a certain leeway at Court; in camp
G50 1490  2    he knew it won you the affection of your men. He had
G50 1490 14    accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of
G50 1500  7    second nature. Underneath, he remained one of the best-educated
G50 1510  7    Russians of his day. He dabbled in verse, could get
G50 1520  5    along well among most of the European languages, and
G50 1530  2    was fluent in French and German. He had also mastered
G50 1530 12    the Cossack tongue.
G50 1540  2       For those little men with the short whiskers, shaven
G50 1550  1    polls, and top knots Suvorov reserved a special esteem.
G50 1550 10    Potemkin- as King Stanislas knew, and presently informed
G50 1560 10    Littlepage- looked on the Cossacks as geopolitical
G50 1570  6    tools. To Serenissimus such tribes as the Cossacks
G50 1580  4    of the Don or those ex-bandits the Zaporogian Cossacks
G50 1590  1    (in whose islands along the lower Dnieper the Polish
G50 1590 10    novelist Sienkiewicz would one day place With Fire
G50 1600  8    and Sword) were just elements for enforced resettlement
G50 1610  5    in, say, Bessarabia, where, as "the faithful of the
G50 1620  5    Black Sea borders", he could use their presence as
G50 1630  2    baragining points in the Czarina's territorial claims
G50 1630  9    against Turkey. Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding
G50 1640  8    skirmishers not demographic units but military men
G50 1650  5    of a high potential. He knew how to channel their exuberant
G50 1660  4    disorderliness so as to transform them from mere plunderers
G50 1665  2    into A-1 guerrilla fighters. He always kept a few on
G50 1670  8    his personal staff. He often donned their tribal costumes,
G50 1680  9    such as the one featuring a tall, black sheepskin hat
G50 1690  8    from the top of which dangled a little red bag ornamented
G50 1700  6    by a chain of worsted lace and tassels; broad red stripes
G50 1710  4    down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round the
G50 1720  2    waist, holding cartridges and light sabre. Suvorov
G50 1720  9    played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his
G50 1730 10    troops. It was probably at this period that Littlepage
G50 1740  5    got his first good look at the ordinary Russian soldier.
G50 1750  3       These illiterate boors conscripted from villages
G50 1760  1    all across the Czarina's empire had, Suvorov may have
G50 1760 10    told Lewis, just two things a commander could count
G50 1770  8    on: physical fitness and personal courage. When their
G50 1780  5    levies came shambling into camp, they were all elbows,
G50 1790  4    hair, and beard. They emerged as interchangeable cogs
G50 1800  1    in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked,
G50 1800 10    hair queued, greatcoated, jackbooted, and best of all-
G50 1810  7    in the opinion of the British professional, Major Semple-Lisle-
G50 1820  6    "their minds are not estranged from the paths of obedience
G50 1830  7    by those smatterings of knowledge which only serve
G50 1840  4    to lead to insubordination and mutiny".
