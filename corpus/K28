K28 0010  1       Going downstairs with the tray, Winston wished he
K28 0010  9    could have given in to Miss Ada, but he knew better
K28 0020 10    than to do what she said when she had that little-girl
K28 0030  6    look. There were times it wasn't right to make a person
K28 0040  5    happy, like the times she came in the kitchen and asked
K28 0050  1    for a peanut butter sandwich. "You know we don't keep
K28 0050 11    peanut butter in this house", he always told her. "Why,
K28 0060  9    Winston", she'd cry, "I just now saw you eating it
K28 0070  9    out of the jar"! But he knew how important it was for
K28 0080  7    her to keep her figure.
K28 0080 12    ##
K28 0080 13    In the kitchen, Leona, his little young wife, was reading
K28 0090  9    the morning paper. Her legs hung down long and thin
K28 0100  8    as she sat on the high stool.
K28 0110  1       "Here", Winston said gently, "what's these dishes
K28 0110  8    doing not washed"? The enormous plates which had held
K28 0120  8    Mr. Jack's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon
K28 0130  8    were still stacked in the sink.
K28 0140  1       "Leave me alone", Leona said. "Can't you see I'm
K28 0150  1    busy"? She looked at him impudently over the corner
K28 0150 10    of the paper.
K28 0160  1       "This is moving day", Winston reminded her, "and
K28 0160  9    I bet you left things every which way upstairs, your
K28 0170  9    clothes all over the floor and the bed not made. Leona"!
K28 0180  8    His eye had fastened on her leg; bending, he touched
K28 0190  5    her knee. "If I catch you one more time down here without
K28 0200  4    stockings"-
K28 0200  5       She twitched her leg away. "Fuss, fuss, old man".
K28 0210  5    She had an alley cat's manners.
K28 0220  1       Winston stacked Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the
K28 0220  9    sink. Then he spread out the last list on the counter.
K28 0230  9    "To Be Left Behind" was printed at the top in Miss
K28 0240  8    Ada; fine hand. Winston took out a pencil, admired
K28 0250  4    the point, and wrote slowly and heavily, "Clothes Stand".
K28 0260  2       Sighing, Leona dropped the paper and stood up. "I
K28 0270  1    guess I better get ready to go".
K28 0270  8       Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron.
K28 0280  5    "Here". Carefully, he undid the bow. "How come your
K28 0290  4    bows is always cockeyed"?
K28 0290  8       She turned and put her arms around his neck. "I
K28 0300  8    don't want to leave here, Winston".
K28 0310  1       "Now listen to that". He drew back, embarrassed
K28 0320  1    and pleased. "I thought you was sick to death of this
K28 0320 12    big house. Said you wore yourself out, cleaning all
K28 0330  7    these empty rooms".
K28 0340  1       "At least there is room here", she said. "What room
K28 0340 10    is there going to be in an apartment for any child"?
K28 0350  9       "I told you what Miss Ada's doctor said".
K28 0360  5       "I don't mean Miss Ada! What you think I care about
K28 0370  7    that? I mean our children". She sounded as though they
K28 0380  5    already existed.
K28 0380  7       In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind,
K28 0390  7    Winston went and put his arm around her waist. "We've
K28 0400  3    got plenty of time to think about that. All the time
K28 0410  2    in the world. We've only been married four years, January".
K28 0420  1       "Four years"! she wailed. "That's a long time, waiting".
K28 0430  1       "How many times have I told you"- he began, and
K28 0440  1    was almost glad when she cut him off- "Too many times"!-
K28 0450  1    and flounced to the sink, where she began noisily to
K28 0450 11    wash her hands.
K28 0460  1       Too many times was the truth of it, Winston thought.
K28 0460 11    He hardly believed his reason himself any more. Although
K28 0470  8    it had seemed a good reason, to begin with: no couple
K28 0480  7    could afford to have children.
K28 0490  1       "How you going to work with a child hanging on you"?
K28 0490 12    he asked Leona. "You want to keep this job, don't you"?
K28 0500 10    He doubted whether she heard him, over the running
K28 0510  8    water.
K28 0510  9       He sat for a while with his hands on his knees,
K28 0520  8    watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her
K28 0530  4    things- a comb, a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs
K28 0540  1    and pack. She made him sad some days, and he was never
K28 0540 13    sure why; it was something to do with her back, the
K28 0550 10    thinness of it, and the quick, jerky way she bent.
K28 0560  6    She was too young, that was all; too young and thin
K28 0570  3    and straight.
K28 0570  5       "Winston"!
K28 0570  6       It was Mr. Jack, bellowing out in the hall. Winston
K28 0580  8    hurried through the swinging door. "I've been bursting
K28 0590  5    my lungs for you", Mr. Jack complained. He was standing
K28 0600  5    in front of the mirror, tightening his tie. He had
K28 0610  3    on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat, and his
K28 0610 14    brief case lay on the bench. "I don't know what you
K28 0620 11    think you've been doing about my clothes", he said.
K28 0630  7    "This coat looks like a rag heap".
K28 0640  1       There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder.
K28 0640 11    Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and
K28 0650  9    went to work. He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over; he
K28 0660  7    brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with
K28 0670  5    long, firm strokes. "Hey"! Mr. Jack cried when the
K28 0680  3    brush tipped his hat down over his eyes.
K28 0680 11       Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right.
K28 0690  8    Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack, who was pulling
K28 0700  7    on his pigskin gloves. Winston enjoyed seeing him start
K28 0710  4    out; he wore his clothes with style. When he was going
K28 0720  2    to town, nothing was good enough- he had cursed at
K28 0720 12    Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace.
K28 0730 11    At home, he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper,
K28 0740  7    and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty
K28 0750  6    old corduroys. The velvet smoking jackets, pearl-gray,
K28 0760  1    wine, and blue, which Miss Ada had bought him hung
K28 0760 11    brushed and unworn in the closet.
K28 0770  5       "Good-by, Winston", Mr. Jack said, giving a final
K28 0780  4    set to his hat. "Look out for those movers"! Winston
K28 0790  2    watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome,
K28 0800  1    fine-looking man it made him proud to see.
K28 0800 10    ##
K28 0800 11    After Mr. Jack drove away, Winston went on looking
K28 0810  7    out the window. He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill
K28 0820  6    and swiped at it with his finger. Then he looked at
K28 0830  2    his finger, at the wrinkled, heavy knuckle and the
K28 0830 11    thick nail he used like a knife to pry up, slit, and
K28 0840 10    open. For the first time, he let himself be sad about
K28 0850  6    the move. That house was ten years off his life. Each
K28 0860  2    brass handle and hinge shone for his reward, and he
K28 0860 12    knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and
K28 0870 11    how to take down the long glass drops which hung from
K28 0880  6    the chandelier. He knew the house like a blind man,
K28 0890  4    through his fingers, and he did not like to think of
K28 0890 15    all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on
K28 0900 11    keeping it up.
K28 0901  1       Ten years ago, he had come to the house to be interviewed.
K28 0910 11    The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming
K28 0920  7    along the drive, and he had walked up from the bus
K28 0930  5    almost singing. Miss Ada had been out back, in a straw
K28 0940  1    hat, planting flowers. She had talked to him right
K28 0940 10    there, with the hot sun in his face, which made him
K28 0950  9    sweat and feel ashamed. Winston had been surprised
K28 0960  4    at her for that. Still, he had liked the way she had
K28 0970  2    looked, in a fresh, neat cotton dress- citron yellow,
K28 0970 11    if he remembered. She had had a dignity about her,
K28 0980  8    even barefoot and almost too tan.
K28 0990  2       Since then, the flowers she had planted had spread
K28 0990 11    all over the hill. Already the jonquils were blooming
K28 1000  9    in a flock by the front gate, and the periwinkles were
K28 1010  6    coming on, blue by the porch steps. In a week the hyacinths
K28 1020  6    would spike out. And the dogwood in early May, for
K28 1030  3    Miss Ada's alfresco party; and after that the Japanese
K28 1050  1    cherries. Now the yard looked wet and bald, the trees
K28 1050 11    bare under their buds, but in a while Miss Ada's flowers
K28 1060  9    would bloom like a marching parade. She had dug a hole
K28 1070  7    for each bulb, each tree wore a tag with her writing
K28 1080  3    on it; where would she go for her gardening now? Somehow
K28 1090  1    Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes.
K28 1100  1       Sighing, he hurried to the living room. He had a
K28 1100 10    thousand things to see to. Still, he couldn't help
K28 1110  6    thinking, we're all getting old, getting small; the
K28 1120  3    snail is pulling in her horns.
K28 1120  9       In the living room, Miss Ada was standing by the
K28 1130  8    window with a sheaf of lists in her hand. She was looking
K28 1140  6    out at the garden.
K28 1140 10       "Winston", she said, "get the basket for the breakables".
K28 1150  9       Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall.
K28 1160  9    He brought it in and put it down beside her. Miss Ada
K28 1170  7    was looking fine; she had on her Easter suit, blue,
K28 1180  3    with lavender binding. Halfway across the house, he
K28 1190  1    could have smelled her morning perfume. It hung in
K28 1190 10    all her day clothes, sweet and strong; sometimes when
K28 1200  6    he was pressing, Winston raised her dresses to his
K28 1210  5    face.
K28 1210  6       Frowning, Miss Ada studied the list. "Well, let's
K28 1220  3    see. The china lemon tree. The alabaster cockatoo".
K28 1230  1    Winston followed her around the room, collecting the
K28 1230  9    small frail objects (Christmas, birthday, and anniversary)
K28 1240  6    and wrapping them in tissue paper. Neither of them
K28 1250  7    trusted the movers.
K28 1250 10       When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph, twenty
K28 1260  7    by twelve inches in a curly silver frame, Miss Ada
K28 1270  5    said, "By rights I ought to leave that, seeing he won't
K28 1280  4    take my clotheshorse". She smiled at Winston, and he
K28 1290  3    saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes. He picked
K28 1290 13    up the photograph and began to wrap it.
K28 1300  6       "At least you could leave it for the movers", Miss
K28 1310  5    Ada said. "What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse
K28 1320  3    would be a good idea"?
K28 1320  8       Winston folded the tissue paper carefully. "He's
K28 1330  5    used it every day; every morning, I lay out his clothes
K28 1340  6    on it".
K28 1340  8       "Well, that's over now. And it was his main present!
K28 1350  7    Leave that fool picture out", she added sharply.
K28 1360  2       Winston laid it in the basket. "Mr. Jack sets store
K28 1370  2    by that".
K28 1370  4       "Really, Winston. It was meant to be my present".
K28 1380  3    But she went on down the list.
K28 1380 10       Winston was relieved; those presents had been on
K28 1390  7    his mind. He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting
K28 1400  6    the valet, but he had actually suggested the photograph
K28 1410  3    to Mr. Jack. "You know what she likes, Winston", he
K28 1420  2    had said wearily, one evening in November when Winston
K28 1420 11    was pulling off his overshoes. "Tell me what to get
K28 1430 10    her for Christmas".
K28 1440  1       "She's been talking about a picture", Winston had
K28 1440  9    told him.
K28 1450  2       "Picture! You mean picture of me"? But Winston had
K28 1460  2    persuaded him.
K28 1460  4       On Christmas night, they had had a disagreement
K28 1470  1    about it. Winston had heard because he was setting
K28 1470 10    up the liquor tray in the next room. Through the door,
K28 1480 10    he had seen Mr. Jack walking around, waiting for Miss
K28 1490  6    Ada. Finally she had come down; Winston had heard her
K28 1500  5    shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess
K28 1510  2    gown.
K28 1510  3       "How do you like it"? she had asked.
K28 1520  1       Mr. Jack had said, "You look about fifteen years
K28 1520 10    old".
K28 1530  1       "Is that a compliment"?
K28 1530  5       "I don't know". He had stood at a little distance,
K28 1540  6    studying her, as though he would walk around next and
K28 1550  3    look at the back of her head.
K28 1550 10       "Lovie, you make me feel naked". Miss Ada had giggled,
K28 1560  8    and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and
K28 1570  5    sank down.
K28 1570  7       "You look like that picture I have at the office",
K28 1580  6    Mr. Jack had started. "Not a line, not a wrinkle. I
K28 1590  5    look like an old man, compared", and he had picked
K28 1600  1    up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still
K28 1600 10    on it. "Look, an old man. Will you wear pink when you're
K28 1610 10    sixty"?
K28 1610 11       "Darling, I love that photograph. I'm going to put
K28 1620  9    it on my dresser".
K28 1630  1       "I guess it's children make a woman old. A man gets
K28 1640  1    old anyhow". After a minute he went on, "People must
K28 1640 11    think the curse is on me, seeing you fresh as an apple
K28 1650 11    and me old and gray".
K28 1660  1       "I'll give you a medical certificate, framed, if
K28 1660  9    you like", Miss Ada had said.
K28 1670  5       "No. All I want is a picture- with a few lines.
K28 1680  4    Make the man put them in if he has to".
K28 1680 14       After that they had sat for five minutes without
K28 1690  9    saying a word. Then Miss Ada had stood up, rustling
K28 1700  6    and rustling, and gone upstairs.
