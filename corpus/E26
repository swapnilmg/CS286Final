E26 0010  1       OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of
E26 0010  8    either attaining greatness or serving his people so
E26 0020  8    well and over so long a span of life. He was born in
E26 0030  8    the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of
E26 0040  4    Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August
E26 0050  1    14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary
E26 0050 10    whose slender income made it difficult to feed his
E26 0060  8    family, let alone educate them in a town without even
E26 0070  7    a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders, his
E26 0080  2    junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home
E26 0080 12    of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction
E26 0090  7    in German; his wife taught the two boys to read and
E26 0100  8    write Danish. Other brothers later joined them for
E26 0110  3    instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also
E26 0110 10    arithmetic was added to Bible reading, German, and
E26 0120  8    Danish in the informal curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions
E26 0130  4    were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider
E26 0140  8    circle of the town's learned, such as the pastor, to
E26 0150  4    supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor,
E26 0160  1    Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university
E26 0160 10    student, some academic subjects. The mayor of the town
E26 0170  9    taught them English and French. Whatever Hans or Anders
E26 0180  7    learned separately they passed on to each other; they
E26 0190  6    read every book that they could borrow in the village.
E26 0200  2    At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father
E26 0200 12    in the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his
E26 0210  8    interest in medicine and science. His earlier love
E26 0220  6    for literature and history remained with him for his
E26 0230  4    entire life.
E26 0230  6       In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University
E26 0240  3    of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following spring
E26 0250  2    found them at the university preparing to matriculate
E26 0250 10    for the autumn session. While Hans devoted himself
E26 0260  7    to the sciences of medicine, physics, and astronomy,
E26 0270  4    his brother studied law. The brothers continued to
E26 0280  2    help each other during their studies, sharing a joint
E26 0280 11    purse, lodging together in the dormitory and dining
E26 0290  8    together at the home of their aunt. They supplemented
E26 0300  5    their income by small government assistance, by tutoring
E26 0310  3    and economizing wherever they could. So impressive
E26 0320  1    were those serious years of study at the university
E26 0320 10    that Hans later wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young
E26 0330  8    man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and
E26 0340  5    imagination; there is a struggle there, in which, if
E26 0350  2    he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is
E26 0350 14    freedom of utterance there, which draws after it no
E26 0360  9    irreparable consequences on society ... I lived in
E26 0370  6    this onward-driving contest where each day overcame
E26 0380  2    a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a
E26 0380 12    previous error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure
E26 0390  7    in lecturing and writing about science. In this third
E26 0400  6    year at the university, Hans, in 1797, was awarded
E26 0410  3    the first important token of recognition, a gold medal
E26 0410 12    for his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed
E26 0420 11    his training in pharmacy also, taking his degree with
E26 0430  8    high honors in 1797, and in 1799 was awarded the degree
E26 0440  8    of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay
E26 0450  6    in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis
E26 0460  1    which later was accepted in chemical practices.
E26 0460  8    #FERMENT OF SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY#
E26 0470  2    HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe was in
E26 0480  3    a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions
E26 0480 10    in America and in France, Germany and Italy were rising
E26 0490  9    from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual
E26 0500  7    awareness was sweeping the Continent.
E26 0510  2       The new century opened with Oersted beginning his
E26 0520  2    professional career in charge of an apothecary shop
E26 0520 10    in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university. He
E26 0530  8    was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery
E26 0550  2    of chemical electricity and he immediately applied
E26 0560  1    the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.
E26 0560 10    The following year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr",
E26 0570  8    traveling in Germany, France, and the Netherlands,
E26 0580  6    meeting the philosophers Schelling, Fichte, and Tieck.
E26 0590  4    He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin Thompson in
E26 0600  3    Woburn, Mass.) who was then serving the Elector of
E26 0610  2    Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's
E26 0610 10    main contacts in science.
E26 0620  4       From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed for 10 days,
E26 0630  4    he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is about
E26 0640  2    galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery
E26 0640 11    of glass tubes I have invented, I have had quite a
E26 0650 10    small one made here of four glass tubes (in Copenhagen
E26 0660  4    I used 30) and intend to carry it with me". Oersted
E26 0670  2    joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks,
E26 0670 13    continuing their correspondence after he left. With
E26 0680  7    Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of
E26 0690  6    ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized
E26 0700  4    mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay
E26 0710  4    in French which was submitted to the Institut de France
E26 0720  1    for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries
E26 0720 11    of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of
E26 0730 10    fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him. In
E26 0740  7    May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight of fancy, wrote
E26 0750  4    to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.
E26 0760  1    He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena
E26 0760 10    and indicated that the years of maximum inclination
E26 0770  8    of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important
E26 0780  6    electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded to
E26 0790  2    the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764 that
E26 0800  2    of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser
E26 0800 11    of Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded,
E26 0810  9    "You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the
E26 0820 10    year 1819 or 1820, you will have to reckon. This we
E26 0830  5    might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted
E26 0840  2    not only lived to see the event occur but was the author
E26 0840 14    of it.
E26 0850  2       In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied
E26 0850 10    for the university's chair in physics but was rejected
E26 0860  9    because he was probably considered more a philosopher
E26 0870  5    than a physicist. However, he continued experimenting
E26 0880  2    and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments
E26 0890  1    in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition
E26 0890 10    was realized and he became professor of physics at
E26 0900  9    the Copenhagen University, though not realizing full
E26 0910  5    professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.
E26 0920  1       During Oersted's attendance at the university, it
E26 0920  8    was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting
E26 0930  7    in the sciences. He was, however, fortunate in his
E26 0940  7    contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey (1769-1842), teacher
E26 0950  6    of chemistry, who, in addition to his academic chair,
E26 0960  4    was also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in Copenhagen
E26 0980  2    where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable
E26 0990  1    collection of physical and chemical apparatus which
E26 0990  8    was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation.
E26 1000  7    In 1800, Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed
E26 1010  6    manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In February 1801, Oersted
E26 1020  4    did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and
E26 1030  2    reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of
E26 1030 10    600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments
E26 1040  9    with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead. In the
E26 1050  7    following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously with
E26 1060  2    Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength
E26 1060  9    of a voltaic battery more than did salts. Eager as
E26 1070  8    he was to pursue this promising line, he was so loaded
E26 1080  6    down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures
E26 1090  3    in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the
E26 1090 11    university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons
E26 1100  8    to "galvanizing".
E26 1110  1       He assumed his academic career with the same intensity
E26 1110 10    and thoroughness that had marked every step in his
E26 1120  9    rise from boyhood. The university was the only one
E26 1130  6    in Denmark and the status of professor represented
E26 1140  2    the upper social level. His broad interest in literary,
E26 1140 11    political, and philosophical movements opened many
E26 1150  6    doors to him. His friends were numerous and their ties
E26 1160  6    to him were strong.
E26 1160 10       The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France
E26 1170 10    again, but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek
E26 1180  8    out the philosophers as he had on his first journey.
E26 1190  3    In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws
E26 1200  1    of nature in German and this was issued in French translation
E26 1200 12    (Paris, 1813) under the title Recherches sur l'identite
E26 1210  8    des forces chimiques et electriques, a work held in
E26 1220  7    very high esteem by the new generation of research
E26 1240  3    chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between
E26 1250  1    voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated.
E26 1250  9    Chapter VIII is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are
E26 1260 10    included such remarks as, "One has always been tempted
E26 1270  8    to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical
E26 1280  4    forces. The great resemblance between electrical and
E26 1290  2    magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity
E26 1290  9    of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison.
E26 1300  8    It is true, that nothing has been found comparable
E26 1310  6    with electricity by communication; but the phenomena
E26 1320  4    observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending
E26 1330  2    on electrical distribution that one could not find
E26 1330 10    the slightest difference ... The form of galvanic
E26 1340  7    activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the
E26 1350  6    electrical form. There, forces are more latent than
E26 1360  2    in electricity, and less than in magnetism ... But
E26 1360 11    in such an important question, we would be satisfied
E26 1370  8    if the judgment were that the principal objection to
E26 1380  5    the identity of forces which produce electricity and
E26 1390  2    magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which
E26 1390 12    is contrary to it ... One could also add to these
E26 1400 11    analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat, which
E26 1410  7    proves that steel becomes a better conductor through
E26 1420  3    a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.
E26 1430  1    It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies
E26 1430 11    of nature, as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that,
E26 1440  8    one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical
E26 1450  7    forces. An attempt should be made to see if electricity,
E26 1460  5    in its most latent stage, has any action on the magnet
E26 1470  2    as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted.
E26 1480  1       Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part
E26 1480  9    in university and political discussions. In one debate
E26 1490  6    he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to
E26 1500  4    dogma, in another he held that the practice of science
E26 1510  1    was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued
E26 1510 11    as a popular lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse
E26 1520  7    in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric
E26 1530  7    current.
E26 1530  8       In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very
E26 1540  5    successful geological expedition to Bornholm, one of
E26 1550  3    the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in
E26 1550 12    the expedition. It was with the assistance of one of
E26 1560  9    the members of this expedition, Lauritz Esmarch, that
E26 1570  4    Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an
E26 1580  4    electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an
E26 1580 12    electric current was made to flow. Together they also
E26 1590  9    developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden
E26 1600  9    trough was replaced by one of copper, thereby producing
E26 1610  4    stronger currents. Esmarch was among those who witnessed
E26 1620  3    Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.
E26 1620  9    #DISCOVERY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM#
E26 1630  3    THE ASSOCIATION between electric (both electrostatic
E26 1640  3    and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized
E26 1650  2    by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature
E26 1660  1    contained numerous references to lightning that had
E26 1660  8    magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass
E26 1670  7    needles. In the late 1700's Beccaria and van Marum,
E26 1680  5    among others, had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic
E26 1690  3    charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on
E26 1700  1    a lead to the relationship between electricity and
E26 1700  9    magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent
E26 1710  7    transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel
E26 1720  5    making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic effect
E26 1730  2    proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.
E26 1740  1    The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already
E26 1740  9    been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect
E26 1750  9    relationship between these two primary forces. Oersted's
E26 1760  5    own earlier experiments were unimpressive, possibly
E26 1770  2    because he had, like other experimenters, laid the
E26 1770 10    conducting wire across the compass needle instead of
E26 1780  8    parallel with it.
E26 1790  1       The sequence of events leading to his important
E26 1790  9    discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that
E26 1800  6    one of the advanced students at the university related
E26 1810  3    that the first direct event that led to the publication
E26 1820  1    of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture
E26 1820  9    made before a group of other advanced students in the
E26 1830 10    spring of 1820. At this lecture Oersted happened to
E26 1840  6    place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic
E26 1850  4    needle.
