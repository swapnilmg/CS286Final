A02 0010  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 0010  3       - Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's "abandoned
A02 0020  2    property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant
A02 0030  1    protests of Texas bankers.
A02 0030  5       Daniel personally led the fight for the measure,
A02 0040  4    which he had watered down considerably since its rejection
A02 0050  2    by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before
A02 0060  1    the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
A02 0060  8       Under committee rules, it went automatically to
A02 0070  6    a subcommittee for one week. But questions with which
A02 0080  4    committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses
A02 0090  1    left little doubt that they will recommend passage
A02 0090  9    of it.
A02 0100  1       Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate
A02 0100  7    that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase
A02 0110  8    an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the
A02 0120  6    end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.
A02 0130  2       He told the committee the measure would merely provide
A02 0130 11    means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on
A02 0140 10    the books "since Texas was a republic". It permits
A02 0150  7    the state to take over bank accounts, stocks and other
A02 0160  4    personal property of persons missing for seven years
A02 0170  2    or more.
A02 0170  4       The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,
A02 0180  1    would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies
A02 0180  8    and other corporations to report such property to the
A02 0190  8    state treasurer. The escheat law cannot be enforced
A02 0200  5    now because it is almost impossible to locate such
A02 0210  2    property, Daniel declared.
A02 0210  5       Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer representing the
A02 0220  4    Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote
A02 0230  2    when he said it would force banks to violate their
A02 0230 12    contractual obligations with depositors and undermine
A02 0240  6    the confidence of bank customers.
A02 0250  2       "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something
A02 0260  1    to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation
A02 0260 11    many millions of dollars".
A02 0270  4       Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the
A02 0280  4    bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to making
A02 0290  2    a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance
A02 0300  1    and pipeline companies".
A02 0300  4       His contention was denied by several bankers, including
A02 0310  3    Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B. Jones of Houston,
A02 0320  3    J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
A02 0330  1       Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"
A02 0340  1    since, he said, it would impair contracts.
A02 0340  8       He also complained that not enough notice was given
A02 0350  7    on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only
A02 0360  3    last Monday.
A02 0370  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 0370  3       - Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill
A02 0380  1    of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment
A02 0390  1    of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four
A02 0390 12    other largest counties.
A02 0400  1       The bill is designed to provide special schooling
A02 0400  9    for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced
A02 0410 10    cost to the state.
A02 0420  1       There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill
A02 0420 11    on to the House.
A02 0430  2       It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to
A02 0430 10    establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties
A02 0440 10    of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children
A02 0450  6    between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools,
A02 0460  6    permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas
A02 0470  2    School for the Deaf here.
A02 0470  7       Operating budget for the day schools in the five
A02 0480  6    counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso
A02 0490  4    would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460
A02 0500  1    yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000
A02 0500 10    was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.
A02 0510  5       The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics
A02 0520  5    to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them
A02 0530  3    from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.

A02 0540  2    DALLAS MAY GET to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels
A02 0550  1    soon between Reps. V. E. (Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
A02 0560  1       While details are still be to worked out, Ratcliff
A02 0560 10    said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he
A02 0570 11    thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should
A02 0580  4    be rejected.
A02 0580  6       "We're getting more 'pro' letters than 'con' on
A02 0590  8    horse race betting", said Ratcliff. "But I believe
A02 0600  6    if people were better informed on this question, most
A02 0610  4    of them would oppose it also. I'm willing to stake
A02 0620  1    my political career on it".
A02 0620  6       Rep. Berry, an ex-gambler from San Antonio, got
A02 0630  5    elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies. A
A02 0640  2    House committee which heard his local option proposal
A02 0640 10    is expected to give it a favorable report, although
A02 0650  8    the resolution faces hard sledding later.

A02 0710  3    districts. Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont
A02 0720  1    Navigation District.
A02 0720  3       The third amended the enabling act for creation
A02 0730  2    of the Lamar county Hospital District, for which a
A02 0730 11    special constitutional amendment previously was adopted.

A02 0760  5    in the future of a school for the mentally retarded
A02 0770  4    in the Gulf Coast district. Money for its construction
A02 0780  1    will be sought later on but in the meantime the State

A02 0790 11    TWO TAX REVISION bills were passed. One, by Sen. Louis
A02 0800  8    Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers
A02 0810  9    who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating
A02 0820  6    the requirement that each return be notarized. Instead,
A02 0830  4    retailers would sign a certificate of correctness,
A02 0840  1    violation of which would carry a penalty of one to
A02 0840 11    five years in prison, plus a $1,000 fine. It was one
A02 0850 10    of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research

A02 0950  6    and Congress, eliminating the need for costly special
A02 0960  5    elections.
A02 0960  6       Under Formby's plan, an appointee would be selected
A02 0970  5    by a board composed of the governor, lieutenant governor,

A02 1000  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1000  3       - State representatives decided Thursday against
A02 1010  1    taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer
A02 1010 12    to pay.
A02 1020  1       An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs
A02 1020 13    Committee a bill which would order the referendum on
A02 1030  9    the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U.S. senator.
A02 1040  7       Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the
A02 1050  6    poll idea, said that further delay in the committee
A02 1060  2    can kill the bill.
A02 1060  6       The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten
A02 1070  5    Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it
A02 1080  2    for public hearing on Feb. 22. The proposal would have
A02 1080 12    to receive final legislative approval, by two-thirds
A02 1090  7    majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April
A02 1100  8    4 ballot, Roberts said.
A02 1100 12       Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't
A02 1110  7    give enough information about tax proposals for the
A02 1120  6    voters to make an intelligent choice.
A02 1130  1       All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep.
A02 1130  9    Bill Jones, who was absent.
A02 1150  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1150  3       - Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'
A02 1160  1    big cities Thursday.
A02 1160  4       Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a
A02 1170  4    water development bill passed by the Texas House of
A02 1180  2    Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas
A02 1180 11    and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a
A02 1190  9    Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
A02 1200  4       When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to
A02 1210  2    4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal
A02 1210 12    is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas.
A02 1220  7       Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against
A02 1230  6    Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse. The bill would increase
A02 1240  4    from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the
A02 1250  2    state could make to a local water project.
A02 1250 10       Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse
A02 1260  8    to help Dallas and other large cities get money which
A02 1270  5    Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for
A02 1280  3    rural Texas.
A02 1280  5       Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying
A02 1290  4    for all its water program by local bonds, and that
A02 1290 14    less populous places would benefit most by the pending
A02 1300  9    bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
A02 1310  3       The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators
A02 1320  2    like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza
A02 1330  4    of Mission, Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman
A02 1340  1    of Sulphur Springs.
A02 1340  4       "This is a poor boy's bill", said Chapman. "Dallas
A02 1350  4    and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would help the
A02 1360  3    little peanut districts".
A02 1370  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1370  3       - A Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature,
A02 1380  1    proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning
A02 1380 10    "educational methods".
A02 1390  2       Rep. Henry C. Grover, who teaches history in the
A02 1400  4    Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12
A02 1400 13    semester hours the so-called "teaching methods" courses
A02 1410  8    required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching
A02 1420  9    certificate. A normal year's work in college is 30
A02 1430  7    semester hours.
A02 1430  9       Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers
A02 1440  6    to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject
A02 1450  5    they are teaching. The remainder of the 4-year college
A02 1460  2    requirement would be in general subjects.
A02 1460  8       "A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry,
A02 1470  8    math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses,
A02 1480  8    is not permitted to teach in the public schools", said
A02 1490  5    Grover.
A02 1490  6       College teachers in Texas are not required to have
A02 1500  6    the Education courses.
A02 1500  9       Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately
A02 1510  6    joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal.

A02 1530  4       - The board of regents of Paris Junior College has
A02 1540  3    named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays, Kan. as the
A02 1550  3    school's new president.
A02 1550  6       Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore, who will
A02 1560  6    retire at the close of the present school term.
A02 1570  3       Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree
A02 1580  2    from the University of Oklahoma. He also received a
A02 1580 11    Master of Science degree from Texas A+I College and
A02 1590  9    a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State
A02 1600  7    College, Weatherford, Okla.
A02 1610  2       In addition, Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island
A02 1620  1    State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A02 1620  8       During his college career, Dr. Clark was captain
A02 1630  9    of his basketball team and was a football letterman.
A02 1640  7       Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in
A02 1650  6    Oklahoma high schools, as teacher and athletic director
A02 1660  3    at Raymondville, Texas, High School, as an instructor
A02 1670  1    at the University of Oklahoma, and as an associate
A02 1670 10    professor of education at Fort Hays, Kan., State College.

A02 1750  1       State and federal legislation against racial discrimination
A02 1750  8    in employment was called for yesterday in a report
A02 1760  9    of a "blue ribbon" citizens committee on the aid to
A02 1770  7    dependent children program.
A02 1780  1       The report, culminating a year long study of the
A02 1780 10    ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare
A02 1790  9    consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations
A02 1800  4    designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load. The
A02 1810  4    report called racial discrimination in employment "one
A02 1820  1    of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion,
A02 1820 10    and ADC dependency".
A02 1830  2    #"MUST SOLVE PROBLEM"#
A02 1830  5    The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients
A02 1840  8    in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C. Virgil
A02 1850  5    Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott + Co., committee
A02 1860  5    chairman.
A02 1860  6       "We must solve the problems which have forced these
A02 1870  5    people to depend upon ADC for subsistence", Martin
A02 1880  2    said.
A02 1880  3       The volume of ADC cases will decrease, Martin reported,
A02 1890  3    when the community is able to deal effectively with
A02 1900  2    two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination
A02 1910  1    in employment because of color. These, he said, are
A02 1910 10    "two of the principal underlying causes for family
A02 1920  5    breakups leading to ADC".
A02 1930  1    #CALLS FOR EXTENSION#
A02 1930  4    Other recommendations made by the committee are:
A02 1940  2       Extension of the ADC program to all children in
A02 1950  1    need living with any relatives, including both parents,
A02 1950  9    as a means of preserving family unity.
A02 1960  4       Research projects as soon as possible on the causes
A02 1970  4    and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
