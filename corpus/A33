A33 0010  1       AT LAST the White House is going to get some much-copied
A33 0020  1    furniture by that master American craftsman, Duncan
A33 0020  8    Phyfe, whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when
A33 0030  8    the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad
A33 0040  7    for their furnishings.
A33 0040 10       The American Institute of Decorators has acquired
A33 0050  6    a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to
A33 0060  6    be placed in the Executive Mansion's library. The suite
A33 0070  3    has been in the same family since the early 1800's.
A33 0080  1    The gift is being presented by "heirs and descendants
A33 0080 10    of the Rutherford family of New Jersey, whose famous
A33 0090  7    estate, "Tranquility", was located near the Duncan
A33 0100  6    Phyfe workshop at Andover, N. J.
A33 0110  1       Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are
A33 0110  8    uncommon, although millions of American homes today
A33 0120  7    display pieces patterned after the style trends he
A33 0130  6    set 150 years ago. This acquisition is a matched, perfect
A33 0140  3    set- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six
A33 0150  1    sidechairs and two armchairs.
A33 0150  5       THE AID HAS undertaken the redecoration of the
A33 0160  5    White House library as a project in connection with
A33 0170  3    the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's
A33 0180  1    Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for
A33 0180  9    the presidential home. It is the AID's intention to
A33 0190  8    create in the library "a miniature museum of Americana"
A33 0200  7    before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this
A33 0210  5    fall.
A33 0210  6       The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians
A33 0220  5    would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe
A33 0230  3    furniture. The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed
A33 0240  1    to Samuel McIntyre of Salem, Mass., an architect and
A33 0240 10    woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol
A33 0250  9    here in 1792.
A33 0260  1       The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem
A33 0260 10    house and is being fitted over the White House library
A33 0270  9    fireplace. It will be painted to match the paneling
A33 0280  6    in the room.
A33 0280  9       The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration,
A33 0290  7    Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon, was in town yesterday to
A33 0300  7    consult with White House staff members on the project.
A33 0310  5    Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates, announced formally
A33 0320  3    yesterday by the AID in New York, include Mrs. Allen
A33 0330  2    Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel, both wellknown
A33 0340  1    Manhattan decorators. Regional representatives appointed
A33 0340  6    to serve from each section of the country include Frank
A33 0350  9    E. Barnes of Boston.
A33 0370  1       PRESIDENT KENNEDY couldn't stay away from his desk
A33 0370  9    for the 75-minute young people's concert played on
A33 0380  9    the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania
A33 0390  7    Symphony Orchestra from Brevard, N. C. But he left
A33 0400  6    the doors to his office open so he could hear the music.
A33 0410  5       At 4 p. m. the President left the White House to
A33 0420  3    welcome the young musicians, students from the ages
A33 0420 11    of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music
A33 0430 12    Center summer camp, and to greet the 325 crippled,
A33 0440  7    cardiac and blind children from the District area who
A33 0450  4    were special guests at the concert.
A33 0450 10       It was the first in the series of "Concerts for
A33 0460  9    Young People by Young People" to be sponsored by First
A33 0470  7    Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House. She was
A33 0480  5    not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the music
A33 0490  2    or watch the faces of the delighted audience.
A33 0490 10       She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in
A33 0510  7    Hyannis Port, Mass., and in his welcoming remarks,
A33 0520  4    the President said he was representing her.
A33 0530  1       As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing
A33 0530  9    the South entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band
A33 0540  8    struck up the "Star Spangled Banner" and followed it
A33 0550  5    with "Hail to the Chief".
A33 0560  1       "I think they played Hail to the Chief better than
A33 0560 11    the Marine Corps Band, and we are grateful to them",
A33 0570  9    President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand
A33 0580  5    and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl.
A33 0590  4       AFTER PAYING tribute to the conductor and his white-clad
A33 0600  5    youthful students, President Kennedy said, "As an American
A33 0610  4    I have the greatest possible pride in the work that
A33 0620  1    is being done in dozens of schools stretching across
A33 0620 10    the United States- schools where devoted teachers are
A33 0630  8    studying with interested young men and women and opening
A33 0640  7    up the whole wide horizon of serious music".
A33 0650  1       He added "... I think that sometimes in this country
A33 0660  1    we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary
A33 0660 12    work that is being done in this field".
A33 0670  7       Displaying his knowledge of music, the New England-born
A33 0680  6    President remarked that "probably the best chamber
A33 0690  3    music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans-
A33 0700  3    and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary
A33 0710  1    musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated
A33 0710 10    all across the United States.
A33 0720  4       "This is a great national cultural asset, and therefore
A33 0730  3    it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing
A33 0740  1    as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today
A33 0740 14    at the White House".
A33 0750  3       As he left the bandstand to return to his office,
A33 0760  1    the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along
A33 0760  9    the way to shake hands with the members of the audience
A33 0770  9    in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field
A33 0780  7    tent set up for the guests.
A33 0780 13       He expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde
A33 0790  8    Patricia Holbrook, 16, of Mount Rainier, had attended
A33 0800  3    the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in
A33 0810  5    Boston. "The nuns there do a wonderful work", the President
A33 0820  3    commented. Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe
A33 0830  2    Health School in the District.
A33 0830  7       Each of the children invited to the concert wore
A33 0840  6    a name tag marked with a red, white and blue ribbon.
A33 0850  3    They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and
A33 0850 11    during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of
A33 0860  9    members of the White House staff.
A33 0870  3       MANY of the music-loving members of the President's
A33 0880  1    staff gathered around the tent listening and watching
A33 0880  9    the rapt attention given by the young seated audience.
A33 0890  9    And it turned out to be more of a family affair than
A33 0900  9    expected. Henry Hall Wilson, a student at the music
A33 0910  5    camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff
A33 0920  2    as liaison representative with the House of Representatives,
A33 0920 10    turned guest conductor for a Sousa march, the "Stars
A33 0930  9    and Stripes Forever".
A33 0950  1       Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday
A33 0950  7    that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige,
A33 0960  6    told about plans for White House youth concerts before
A33 0970  8    the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia
A33 0980  5    last spring.
A33 0980  7       He said he contacted a friend, Henry Hall Wilson,
A33 0990  6    on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra
A33 1000  5    could play, in the series. A flow of correspondence
A33 1010  1    between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation
A33 1020  1    to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the
A33 1020 11    first concert.
A33 1040  1       ONE OF THE MOST interested "students" on the tour
A33 1040 10    which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery
A33 1050  9    yesterday following their concert at the White House,
A33 1060  7    was Letitia Baldrige, social secretary to First Lady
A33 1070  5    Jacqueline Kennedy.
A33 1070  7       "I was an art major in college", Miss Baldrige explained.
A33 1080  7    "I've been here so many times I couldn't count them".
A33 1090  8    She turned out to be a fan, too, of Margaret Bouton,
A33 1100  5    the Gallery's associate curator of education.
A33 1110  1       Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that
A33 1110 11    went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed
A33 1120  9    at 5 p. m. The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the
A33 1140  9    Gallery at 6 p. m., remaining for about 45 minutes.
A33 1150  5       The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the
A33 1160  5    beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided
A33 1170  1    that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him
A33 1170  9    look "sad"... they noticed Roman buildings in the background
A33 1180  8    of Raphael's "Alba Madonna" and "texture" in a Monet
A33 1190  8    painting of Rheims Cathedral. Everybody had heard of
A33 1200  6    Van Gogh, the French impressionist.
A33 1210  1       Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group,
A33 1210  8    standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby
A33 1220 10    to speak to them. He pointed out to the young musicians
A33 1230  8    that the National Gallery "is the only museum in the
A33 1240  6    country to have a full-time music director ... Richard
A33 1250  3    Bales ... I'm sure you've heard af him ... and his
A33 1260  1    record, 'The Confederacy'".
A33 1260  4       Along with the gallery aide who explained the various
A33 1270  5    paintings and sculptures to each group, went one of
A33 1280  3    the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.
A33 1280  8       In 45 minutes, the Gallery leaders had given the
A33 1290  7    students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance
A33 1300  4    to the late 19th Century.
A33 1300  9       A few of them said they "preferred contemporary
A33 1310  5    art".
A33 1310  6       Among the other artists, whose paintings were discussed
A33 1320  6    were Boucher, Courbet, Fra Angelico.
A33 1330  2       The thing that impressed one of the visitors the
A33 1330 11    most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain ... "because
A33 1340  8    it's on the second floor".
A33 1360  1       That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote
A33 1360  8    collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its
A33 1370  8    threshold at 1733 16th st. nw. took on bustling life
A33 1380  6    yesterday.
A33 1380  7       More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered
A33 1390  6    in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their
A33 1400  6    most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed the
A33 1410  2    Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.
A33 1410  8       They came together in the huge, high-ceilinged Council
A33 1420  6    Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized. C. Wheeler
A33 1430  3    Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado,
A33 1440  3    praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist,
A33 1450  1    lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most
A33 1450  9    of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic
A33 1460  8    Order.
A33 1460  9       The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at
A33 1470  9    the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple. A reception
A33 1480  6    and tea followed.
A33 1480  9       About 1500 delegates are expected to register today
A33 1490  7    for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted
A33 1500  4    Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the
A33 1510  3    United States.
A33 1510  5       The opening session of the 5-day session will begin
A33 1520  3    at 10 a. m. today. There will be a pilgrimage to Mount
A33 1530  2    Vernon at 2:30 p. m. A wreath will be placed at the
A33 1540  1    tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first
A33 1540 10    Masons- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge
A33 1550  8    22 in Alexandria.
A33 1560  1       THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly
A33 1560 10    reached the breaking point after eight years.
A33 1570  7       John had a job in a small firm where the work was
A33 1580  6    dull and monotonous. He would come home in the evening
A33 1590  3    tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play
A33 1590 13    with their three children, or spend much time chatting
A33 1600  9    with his wife.
A33 1610  1       Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary
A33 1610 10    complained often that he didn't help around the house,
A33 1620  8    and that he didn't really care about the family. She
A33 1630  6    accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told her she
A33 1640  3    demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted
A33 1650  1    and miserable.
A33 1650  3       Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite
A33 1660  1    plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could
A33 1660 13    be done. The judge listened quietly as the young woman
A33 1670  8    poured out her frustrations- then discussing with her
A33 1680  7    the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service
A33 1690  2    before going to a lawyer.
A33 1690  7       Family Service, sharing in UGF, has five agencies
A33 1700  6    in the Washington area. They offer to the people of
A33 1710  5    this community case work service and counseling on
A33 1720  1    a wide variety of family problems.
A33 1720  7       Because neither of them really wanted their marriage
A33 1730  4    to break up, Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series
A33 1740  4    of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia,
A33 1750  1    the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have
A33 1750 11    been receiving counseling, separately and together,
A33 1760  5    in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms
A33 1770  4    which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.
A33 1780  1    The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation
A33 1780 12    of the problems confronting the other. They are now
A33 1790  9    working together toward solving their difficulties.
A33 1800  4       JOHN received a promotion in his firm. He gives
A33 1810  6    credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life.
A33 1820  2    Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home
A33 1820 12    in the evenings, and the children's bed-time is frequently
A33 1830  8    preceeded by a session of happy, family rough-housing.
A33 1840  6       To outsiders, the Blacks seem to be an ordinary,
A33 1850  5    happy family, and they are- but with a difference.
A33 1860  1    They know the value of being just that- an ordinary,
A33 1860 11    happy family.
A33 1870  1       Family Service has helped hundreds of families in
A33 1870  9    this area. Perhaps to some their work does not seem
A33 1880 10    particularly vital. But to the families it serves,
A33 1890  6    their help cannot be measured. Family Service could
A33 1900  2    not open its doors to a single family without the financial
A33 1910  1    support of the United Givers Fund.
A33 1920  1       Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive
A33 1920  8    failed to materialize yesterday, park rangers said,
A33 1930  6    and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of
A33 1940  6    the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.
