B20 0010  1    #ESCALATION UNTO DEATH#
B20 0010  4    The nuclear war is already being fought, except that
B20 0020  3    the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not
B20 0020 13    yet. It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close
B20 0030  9    correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers
B20 0040  6    of the think factories. They predicted escalation,
B20 0050  2    and escalation is what we are getting. The biggest
B20 0050 11    nuclear device the United States has exploded measured
B20 0060  8    some 15 megatons, although our B-52s are said to be
B20 0070  9    carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece. Some time ago,
B20 0080  5    however, Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs
B20 0090  3    were made, the Soviet Union would make them. He seems
B20 0100  1    to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on
B20 0100 14    hand, since we cannot assume that he has exploded his
B20 0110  7    entire stock. And now, of course, the hue and cry for
B20 0120  6    counter-escalation is being raised on our side. Khrushchev
B20 0130  2    threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb? So be it- then
B20 0140  1    we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs
B20 0140 12    of the common or hydrogen variety, and neutron bombs,
B20 0150  7    which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing.
B20 0160  6    So escalation proceeds, ad infinitum or, more accurately,
B20 0170  2    until the contestants begin dropping them on each other
B20 0180  1    instead of on their respective proving grounds.
B20 0180  8       What is needed, Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell
B20 0190  7    Daily Sun (October 26) is a discontinuity. The escalation
B20 0200  7    must end sometime, and probably quite soon. "Only a
B20 0210  5    discontinuity can end it", Professor Morrison writes.
B20 0220  2    "The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction,
B20 0230  1    or that of diplomatic policy".
B20 0230  6       Morrison points out that since our country is more
B20 0240  7    urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China, it is
B20 0250  4    the most vulnerable of the great powers- Europe of
B20 0260  1    course must be written off out of hand. He feels, therefore,
B20 0260 12    that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of
B20 0270  9    the United States is the least risky path our government
B20 0280  6    can take. His proposal is opposed to that of Richard
B20 0290  4    Nixon, Governor Rockefeller, past chairmen Strauss
B20 0300  1    and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Edward
B20 0300 10    Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of
B20 0310  9    triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war. These
B20 0320  6    gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing-
B20 0330  3    in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale,
B20 0330 11    all in the name of national security. Escalation is
B20 0340  9    their first love and their last; they will be faithful
B20 0350  7    unto death.
B20 0350  9       Capable as their minds may be in some directions,
B20 0360  7    these guardians of the nation's security are incapable
B20 0370  4    of learning, or even of observing. If this capacity
B20 0380  1    had not failed them, they would see that their enemy
B20 0380 11    has made a disastrous miscalculation. He has gained
B20 0390  6    only one thing- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and
B20 0400  6    he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob
B20 0410  3    it over the shorter intercontinental ranges. But if
B20 0410 11    his purpose was to inspire terror, his action could
B20 0420  9    hardly have miscarried more obviously. Not terror,
B20 0430  5    but anger and resentment have been the general reaction
B20 0440  2    outside the Soviet sphere.
B20 0440  6       Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by
B20 0450  6    the surge of animosity he has aroused, yet our own
B20 0460  3    nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively
B20 0460 10    in his footsteps. When one powerful nation strives
B20 0470  7    to emulate the success of another, it is only natural.
B20 0480  7    Thus, when the Russians sent up their first sputnik,
B20 0490  3    American chagrin was human enough, and American determination
B20 0500  1    to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly
B20 0500  9    understandable. But to imitate an opponent when he
B20 0510  8    has made the mistake of his life would be a new high
B20 0520  8    in statesmanlike folly.
B20 0520 11    #THE TIDE TURNS#
B20 0530  1    When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands,
B20 0530 11    paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists.
B20 0540  9    They are less vocal now, when it is the West Berliners
B20 0550  8    who are migrating. The flood is not as great- only
B20 0560  6    700 a week according to one apparently conservative
B20 0570  1    account- but it is symptomatic. West Berlin morale
B20 0570  8    is low and, in age distribution, the situation is unfavorable.
B20 0580  8    Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents
B20 0590  6    are sixty-five or older, only 12.8 per cent are under
B20 0600  7    fifteen.
B20 0600  8       R. H. S. Crossman, M.P., writing in The Manchester
B20 0610  6    Guardian, states that departures from West Berlin are
B20 0620  6    now running at the rate not of 700, but of 1,700 a
B20 0630  5    week, and applications to leave have risen to 1,900
B20 0630 14    a week. The official statistics show that 60 per cent
B20 0640 10    are employed workers or independent professional people.
B20 0650  5    Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked
B20 0660  5    for months ahead. The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced
B20 0670  2    by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany, but the
B20 0680  1    hard truth, says Crossman, is that "The closing off
B20 0680 10    of East Berlin without interference from the West and
B20 0690  7    with the use only of East German, as distinct from
B20 0700  5    Russian, troops was a major Communist victory, which
B20 0710  2    dealt West Berlin a deadly, possibly a fatal, blow.
B20 0710 11    The gallant half-city is dying on its feet".
B20 0720  9       Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch
B20 0730  6    from Bonn in the Observer (London). Mark Arnold-Foster
B20 0740  4    writes: "People are leaving [West Berlin] because they
B20 0750  3    think it is dying. They are leaving so fast that the
B20 0760  2    president of the West German Employers' Federation
B20 0760  9    issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the
B20 0770  9    West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in
B20 0780  6    factories in West Berlin. Berlin's resilience is amazing,
B20 0790  4    but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle
B20 0800  2    will be hard indeed".
B20 0800  6       The handwriting is on the wall. The only hope for
B20 0810  5    West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down
B20 0820  3    the wall and reunite the city. State Department officials
B20 0830  1    refusing to show their passes at the boundary, and
B20 0830 10    driving two blocks into East Berlin under military
B20 0840  6    escort, will not avail. Tanks lined up at the border
B20 0850  5    will be no more helpful. The materials for compromise
B20 0860  1    are at hand: The Nation, Walter Lippmann and other
B20 0860 10    sober commentators (see Alan Clark on p. 367) have
B20 0870  9    spelled them out again and again. A compromise will
B20 0880  6    leave both sides without the glow of triumph, but it
B20 0890  4    will save Berlin. Or the city can be a graveyard monument
B20 0900  1    to Western intransigence, if that is what the West
B20 0900 10    wants.
B20 0900 11    #VACANCY#
B20 0910  1    The removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he
B20 0910 10    shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in
B20 0920  8    the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history. It
B20 0930  5    is, in fact, a relatively mild chastisement of the
B20 0940  3    dead. A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book,
B20 0950  1    Dead Men Tell Tales, recalls that in the turmoil preceding
B20 0960  1    the French Revolution the body of Henry IV, who had
B20 0960 11    died nearly 180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by
B20 0970  9    a mob. And in England, after the Restoration, the body
B20 0980  5    of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn. The
B20 0990  3    head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster, and the
B20 1000  1    rest of the body was buried under the gallows.
B20 1000 10       Contemplating these posthumous punishments, Stalin
B20 1010  5    should not lose all hope. In 1899, Parliament erected
B20 1020  3    a statue to Cromwell in Westminster, facing Whitehall
B20 1030  2    and there, presumably, he still stands. Nikita Khrushchev,
B20 1040  1    however, has created yet another problem for himself.
B20 1040  9    The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy,
B20 1050  7    Moscow is a crowded city, and the creed of communism
B20 1060  6    deplores waste. Who will take Stalin's place beside
B20 1070  3    Lenin? There is Karl Marx, of course, buried in London.
B20 1090  1    The Macmillan government might be willing to let him
B20 1090 10    go, but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even
B20 1100  8    the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable.
B20 1110  6    Who, then, is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin?
B20 1120  4    Who but Nikita himself? Since he has just shown who
B20 1130  3    is top dog, he may not be ready to receive this highest
B20 1130 15    honor in the gift of the Soviet people. Besides, he
B20 1140 10    can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death
B20 1150  6    which, what with exhumations and rehabilitations, seems
B20 1160  2    to match that of life. Suppose he did lie beside Lenin,
B20 1170  1    would it be permanent? If some future Khrushchev decided
B20 1170 10    to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor,
B20 1180  9    would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions
B20 1190  6    applauding his dispossession? When a man is laid to
B20 1200  6    rest, he is entitled to stay put. If Nikita buys a
B20 1210  2    small plot in some modest rural cemetery, everyone
B20 1210 10    will understand.
B20 1220  1    #U THANT OF BURMA#
B20 1220  5    The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting
B20 1230  3    Secretary General- at this writing, the choice appears
B20 1240  2    to be certain- offers further proof that in politics
B20 1250  1    it is more important to have no influential enemies
B20 1250 10    than to have influential friends. Mongi Slim of Tunisia
B20 1260  6    and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites
B20 1280  2    in the running, but France didn't like the former and
B20 1290  3    the Soviet Union would have none of the latter. With
B20 1290 13    the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their
B20 1300  8    own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold, U Thant emerged as
B20 1320  6    the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid
B20 1330  4    by a veto. What is interesting is that his positive
B20 1340  1    qualifications for the post were revealed only as a
B20 1340 10    kind of tail to his candidacy. In all the bitter in-fighting,
B20 1350  9    the squabbles over election procedures, the complicated
B20 1360  4    numbers game that East and West played on the assistant
B20 1370  4    secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed
B20 1380  1    himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.
B20 1380 12    He has, moreover, another qualification which augurs
B20 1390  6    well for the future. He is a Buddhist, which means
B20 1400  7    that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are
B20 1410  4    not only religious dogma, but a profound and unshakable
B20 1420  1    Weltanschauung.
B20 1420  2       U Thant of course, will hold office until the spring
B20 1430  3    of 1963, when Mr. Hammarskjold's term would have come
B20 1440  1    to an end. Whether the compromises- on both sides-
B20 1440 10    that made possible the interim appointment can then
B20 1450  7    be repeated remains to be seen. Mr. Khrushchev's demand
B20 1460  4    for a troika is dormant, not dead; the West may or
B20 1470  5    not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that
B20 1480  2    U Thant represents. In a sense, the showdown promised
B20 1480 11    by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been
B20 1490  8    avoided; no precedents have been set as yet; structurally,
B20 1500  7    the U.N. is still fluid, vulnerable to the pressures
B20 1510  6    that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to
B20 1520  4    bear upon it. But at least the pessimists who believed
B20 1530  1    that the world organization had plunged to its death
B20 1530 10    in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong.
B20 1540  9    #TO THE HILLS, GIRLS#
B20 1550  1    No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose
B20 1550 11    that words are their sole staple in trade. These are
B20 1560  8    mentalities which crave action- and they are beginning
B20 1570  7    to get it, as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page
B20 1580  4    372. Even in areas where political connotations are
B20 1590  1    (deliberately?) left vague, the spirit of vigilantism
B20 1590  8    is spreading. Friends, a picture magazine distributed
B20 1600  6    by Chevrolet dealers, describes a paramilitary organization
B20 1610  4    of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley,
B20 1620  4    Alabama. "If the day should ever come that foreign
B20 1630  2    invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast", the account
B20 1630 11    reads, "they can count on heavy opposition from a group
B20 1640 10    of commando-trained telephone employees- all girls.
B20 1650  5    ... Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil
B20 1660  6    Defense outfit, 23 operators and office personnel ...
B20 1670  3    stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice".
B20 1680  1    According to Friends, the unit was organized by John
B20 1680 10    Snook, a former World War II commando who is vice
B20 1690 10    president and general manager of the telephone company.
B20 1700  6    The girls, very fetching in their uniforms, are shown
B20 1710  4    firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;
B20 1720  1    they are also trained with carbines, automatic weapons,
B20 1720  9    pistols, rifles and other such ladies' accessories.
B20 1730  7       This may be opera bouffe now, but it will become
B20 1740  7    more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy. The
B20 1750  5    country is committed to the doctrine of security by
B20 1760  2    military means. The doctrine has never worked; it is
B20 1760 11    not working now. The official military establishment
B20 1770  6    can only threaten to use its nuclear arms; it cannot
B20 1780  6    bring them into actual play. A more dangerous formula
B20 1790  2    for national frustration cannot be imagined. As the
B20 1790 10    civic temper rises, the more naive citizens begin to
B20 1800  9    play soldier- but the guns are real. Soon they will
B20 1810  8    begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are
B20 1820  4    in our midst.
