B12 0010  1       SING SING'S prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable
B12 0020  1    purpose, a fair break from parole boards. But once
B12 0020 10    the strike trend hits hoosegows, there is no telling
B12 0030  7    how far it may go. Inmates might even demand the 34-hour
B12 0040  6    week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including
B12 0050  1    state contributions toward lawyers' fees. Some day

B12 0510 11    for Gen. Chung Hee Park, the new leader of South Korea.

B12 0540  8    the man who was instrumental in opening relations between
B12 0550  5    the United States and Korea, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen,

B12 0830  2    Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn
B12 0830 11    is one from Rep. Dwyer, R-6th Dist. Mrs. Dwyer's
B12 0840 10    husband, M. Joseph Dwyer, was taking a 10-year-old
B12 0850 10    boy from Union County on the tour of the Capitol during
B12 0860  8    the final weeks of the last session. They ran across
B12 0870  4    Mr. Rayburn and the youngster expressed a desire to
B12 0880  3    get the Speaker's autograph.
B12 0880  7       Mr. Dwyer said that although it was obvious that
B12 0890  6    Mr. Rayburn was not well he stopped, gave the youngster

B12 0930  1       THE 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is
B12 0930 10    being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing
B12 0940  6    today of the New Testament, the first part of the New
B12 0950  7    English Bible, undertaken as a new translation of the
B12 0960  4    Scriptures into contemporary English.
B12 0960  8       Since it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King
B12 0970 11    James Version has been most generally considered the
B12 0980  6    most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the
B12 0990  3    Bible. However, Biblical scholars frequently attested
B12 1000  1    to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were
B12 1000  9    uncovered and scholarship advanced.
B12 1010  4       This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible
B12 1020  3    in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901
B12 1030  2    as the American Standard Version. Then in 1937 America's
B12 1040  1    International Council of Religious Education authorized
B12 1040  7    a new revision, in the light of expanded knowledge
B12 1050  7    of ancient manuscripts and languages. Undertaken by
B12 1060  3    32 American scholars, under the chairmanship of Rev.
B12 1070  3    Dr. Luther A. Weigle, former dean of Yale University
B12 1080  1    Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing
B12 1080  9    of the Revised Standard Version, 1946-52.
B12 1090  6    #NOT RIVAL#
B12 1090  8    The New English Bible (the Old Testament and Apocrypha
B12 1100  7    will be published at a future date) has not been planned
B12 1110  7    to rival or replace the King James Version, but, as
B12 1120  4    its cover states, it is offered "simply as the Bible
B12 1130  1    to all those who will use it in reading, teaching,
B12 1130 11    or worship".
B12 1140  1       Time, of course will testify whether the new version
B12 1140 10    will have achieved its purpose. Bible reading, even
B12 1150  7    more so than good classical music, grows in depth and
B12 1160  6    meaning upon repetition.
B12 1160  9       If this new Bible does not increase in significance
B12 1170  8    by repeated readings throughout the years, it will
B12 1180  5    not survive the ages as has the King James Version.
B12 1190  2       However, an initial perusal and comparison of some
B12 1200  1    of the famous passages with the same parts of other
B12 1200 11    versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the
B12 1210  8    British Biblical scholars. One is impressed with the
B12 1220  4    dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation
B12 1230  1    into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that
B12 1230 10    the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable
B12 1240  7    to the general reader in contemporary language than
B12 1250  3    in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the
B12 1270  1    King James.
B12 1270  3       For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses
B12 1280  1    13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version
B12 1280 11    reads:
B12 1290  1       "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John,
B12 1300  1    to be baptized of him.
B12 1300  6       "But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be
B12 1310  4    baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
B12 1310 12       "And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to
B12 1320  9    be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.
B12 1330  7    Then he suffered him.
B12 1340  1       "And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway
B12 1340 10    out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto
B12 1350  9    him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
B12 1360  6    dove, and lighting upon him".
B12 1360 11    #CLEARER MEANING#
B12 1370  2    Certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not
B12 1380  1    familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English
B12 1380  9    Bible which reads: "Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from
B12 1390  7    Galilee, and he came to John to be baptized by him.
B12 1400  8    John tried to dissuade him. 'Do you come to me'? he
B12 1410  5    said; 'I need rather to be baptized by you'. Jesus
B12 1420  2    replied, 'let it be so for the present; we do well
B12 1420 13    to conform this way with all that God requires'. John
B12 1430 10    then allowed him to come. After baptism Jesus came
B12 1440  7    up out of the water at once, and at that moment heaven
B12 1450  5    opened; he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
B12 1460  3    dove to alight upon him";
B12 1460  8       (the paragraphing, spelling and punctuation are
B12 1470  4    reproduced as printed in each version.)
B12 1480  1       Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences
B12 1480  7    are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons, other than
B12 1490  8    scholars, really understand the true meaning of these
B12 1500  5    eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of
B12 1510  2    the Sermon on the Mount.
B12 1510  7       To illustrate, the first blessing in the King James
B12 1520  5    Bible reads: "Blessed are the poor in spirit; for their's
B12 1530  4    is the kingdom of heaven". The new version states:
B12 1540  2    "How blest are those who know that they are poor; the
B12 1550  1    kingdom of Heaven is theirs".
B12 1550  6       Some of the poetic cadence of the older version
B12 1560  4    certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone,
B12 1570  1    with a fair knowledge of the English language, can
B12 1570 10    understand the meaning, without the necessity of interpretation
B12 1580  7    by a Biblical scholar. To a novice that is significant.
B12 1600  4       In the second and third chapters of Revelation the
B12 1610  5    new version retains, however, the old phrase "angel
B12 1620  2    of the church" which Biblical scholars have previously
B12 1630  1    interpreted as meaning bishop. This is not contemporary
B12 1630  9    English.
B12 1630 10    #MOSTLY CONTEMPORARY#
B12 1640  2    For the most part, however, the new version is contemporary
B12 1650  2    and, as such, should be the means for many to attain
B12 1650 13    a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words
B12 1660  9    recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first
B12 1670  7    followers of Christ.
B12 1670 10       Originally recorded by hand, these words have been
B12 1680  8    copied and recopied, translated and retranslated through
B12 1690  4    the ages. Discoveries recently made of old Biblical
B12 1700  3    manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings,
B12 1710  1    some by the early church fathers, in themselves called
B12 1710 10    for a restudy of the Bible. To have the results recorded
B12 1720  9    in everyday usable English should be of benefit to
B12 1730  7    all who seek the truth.
B12 1730 12       There is one danger, however. With contemporary
B12 1740  7    English changing with the rapidity that marks this
B12 1750  5    jet age, some of the words and phrases of the new version
B12 1760  3    may themselves soon become archaic. The only answer
B12 1760 11    will be continuous study.
B12 1770  4       The New Testament offered to the public today is
B12 1780  3    the first result of the work of a joint committee made
B12 1780 14    up of representatives of the Church of England, Church
B12 1790  9    of Scotland, Methodist Church, Congregational Union,
B12 1800  5    Baptist Union, Presbyterian Church of England, Churches
B12 1810  5    in Wales, Churches in Ireland, Society of Friends,
B12 1820  4    British and Foreign Bible Society and National Society
B12 1830  2    of Scotland.
