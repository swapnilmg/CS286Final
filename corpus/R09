R09 0010  1       DEAR SIRS: LET ME BEGIN by clearing up any possible
R09 0010 11    misconception in your minds, wherever you are. The
R09 0020  8    collective by which I address you in the title above
R09 0030  7    is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial
R09 0040  4    term in use among professional thieves. It is, I am
R09 0050  2    reliably given to understand, the technical argot for
R09 0050 10    those who engage in your particular branch of the boost;
R09 0060  8    i.e., burglars who rob while the tenants are absent,
R09 0070  7    in contrast to hot-slough prowlers, those who work
R09 0080  4    while the occupants are home. Since the latter obviously
R09 0090  1    require an audacity you do not possess, you may perhaps
R09 0090 11    suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior.
R09 0100  8    Far from it; I merely draw an etymological distinction,
R09 0110  5    hoping that specialists and busy people like you will
R09 0120  4    welcome such precision in a layman. Above all, disabuse
R09 0130  1    yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral
R09 0130 11    indignation at your rifling my residence, to whimper
R09 0140  8    over the loss of a few objets d'art, or to shame you
R09 0150  6    into rectitude. My object, rather, is to alert you
R09 0160  3    to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the
R09 0160 15    gravest implications for you, far beyond the legal
R09 0170  8    sanctions society might inflict. You have unwittingly
R09 0180  5    set in motion forces so malign, so vindictive, that
R09 0190  2    it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you
R09 0190 13    about them. Quite candidly, fellows, I wouldn't be
R09 0200  8    in your shoes for all the rice in China.
R09 0210  6       As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances
R09 0220  1    in the press of more recent depredations, permit me
R09 0220 10    to recapitulate them briefly. Sometime on Saturday
R09 0230  6    evening, August 22nd, while my family and I were dining
R09 0240  8    at the Hostaria dell' Orso, in Rome, you jimmied a
R09 0250  5    window of our home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and
R09 0260  2    let yourselves into the premises. Hastening to the
R09 0260 10    attic, the temperature of which was easily hotter than
R09 0270  8    the Gold Coast, you proceeded to mask the windows with
R09 0280  6    a fancy wool coverlet, some khaki pants, and the like,
R09 0290  4    and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored
R09 0300  1    there. What you were looking for (unless you make a
R09 0300 11    hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens)
R09 0310  7    eludes me, but to judge from phonograph records scattered
R09 0320  4    about a fumed-oak Victrola, you danced two tangos and
R09 0330  4    a paso doble, which must have been fairly enervating
R09 0340  1    in that milieu. You then descended one story, glommed
R09 0340 10    a television set from the music room- the only constructive
R09 0350  9    feature of your visit, by the way- and, returning to
R09 0360  7    the ground floor, entered the master bedroom. From
R09 0370  3    the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus
R09 0380  1    beneath, you abstracted seventeen ivory, metal, wood,
R09 0380  8    and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin,
R09 0390  6    two snuffboxes, and a jade-handled magnifying glass.
R09 0400  3    Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby, you unearthed
R09 0410  2    an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood,
R09 0410 11    which, along with two box Kodaks, you added to your
R09 0420 10    haul. Then, having wrapped the lot in an afghan my
R09 0430  8    dog customarily slept on, you lammed out the front
R09 0440  3    door, considerately leaving it open for neighbors to
R09 0440 11    discover.
R09 0450  1       So much for the tiresome facts, as familiar to you,
R09 0450 11    I'm sure, as to the constables and state troopers who
R09 0460 10    followed in your wake. The foregoing, aided by several
R09 0470  6    clues I'll withhold to keep you on your toes, will
R09 0480  5    pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert,
R09 0490  2    but before they close in, gird yourselves, I repeat,
R09 0490 11    for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless. Fourteen
R09 0500  5    of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most
R09 0510  6    curious and terrifying nature, as you will observe
R09 0520  2    when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls
R09 0520 12    out in patches. In time, these minor manifestations
R09 0530  7    will multiply and effloresce, riddling you with frambesia,
R09 0540  4    the king's evil, sheep rot, and clonic spasm, until
R09 0550  3    your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out
R09 0550 13    for release. All this, though, is simply a prelude,
R09 0560  9    a curtain-raiser, for what ensues, and I doubt whether
R09 0570  8    any Occidental could accurately forecast it. If, however,
R09 0580  5    it would help to intensify your anguish, I can delimit
R09 0590  4    the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted
R09 0600  1    and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous
R09 0600 11    instance. Hold on tight.
R09 0610  4       First of all, the six figures of the Buddha you
R09 0620  2    heisted- four Siamese heads, a black obsidian statuette
R09 0620 10    in the earth-touching position, and a large brass figure
R09 0630  9    of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base. Now, you probably
R09 0640  8    share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha
R09 0650  6    is the most compassionate of the gods, much more so
R09 0660  4    than Jehovah and Allah and the rest. 'Fess up- don't
R09 0670  1    you? Well, ordinarily he is, except (as the Wheel of
R09 0670 11    the Law specifies) toward impious folk who steal, disturb,
R09 0680  9    or maltreat the Presence. Very peculiar retribution
R09 0690  5    indeed seems to overtake such jokers. Eight or ten
R09 0700  5    years ago, a couple of French hoods stole a priceless
R09 0710  1    Khmer head from the Musee Guimet, in Paris, and a week
R09 0710 12    later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable
R09 0720  7    symptoms of leprosy. Hell's own amount of chaulmoogra
R09 0730  6    oil did nothing to alleviate their torment; they expired
R09 0750  4    amid indescribable fantods, imploring the Blessed One
R09 0760  2    to forgive their desecration. Any reputable French
R09 0760  9    interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances,
R09 0770  9    and I'll presently recount a case out of my own personal
R09 0780  9    experience, but, for the moment, let's resume our catalogue.
R09 0790  5       Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you
R09 0800  4    lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers
R09 0810  1    to lead, as a dealer in Khartoum assured me, I am not
R09 0810 13    competent to say. Likewise the ivory Chinese female
R09 0820  7    figure known as a "doctor lady" (provenance Honan);
R09 0830  4    a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet
R09 0840  3    for inspection was felled as if by a hammer, but he
R09 0840 14    had previously drunk a quantity of applejack. The three
R09 0850  9    Indian brass deities, though- Ganessa, Siva, and Krishna-
R09 0860  5    are an altogether different cup of tea. They hail from
R09 0870  7    Travancore, a state in the subcontinent where Kali,
R09 0880  3    the goddess of death, is worshiped. Have you ever heard
R09 0890  2    of thuggee? Nuf sed ... But it is the wooden sculpture
R09 0890 13    from Bali, the one representing two men with their
R09 0900  9    heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by
R09 0910  5    a fish, that I particularly call to your attention.
R09 0920  2    Oddly enough, this is an amulet against housebreakers,
R09 0920 10    presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949.
R09 0930 12    Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese, a
R09 0940  9    dialect I take it you don't comprehend. Neither do
R09 0950  4    I, but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate,
R09 0960  3    and I'll do as much for you. Whosoever violates our
R09 0970  1    rooftree, the legend states, can expect maximal sorrow.
R09 0970  9    The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles, his
R09 0980  9    wife will make him cocu with fishmongers, and a trolley
R09 0990  6    car will grow in his stomach. Furthermore- and this,
R09 1000  5    to me, strikes an especially warming note- it shall
R09 1010  1    avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of
R09 1010 11    their loot. The cycle of disaster starts the moment
R09 1020  7    they touch any belonging of ours, and dogs them unto
R09 1030  5    the forty-fifth generation. Sort of remorseless, isn't
R09 1040  2    it? Still, there it is.
R09 1040  7       Now, you no doubt regard the preceding as pap; you're
R09 1050  6    tooling around full of gage in your hot rods, gorging
R09 1060  3    yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns
R09 1070  1    and generally behaving like U^bermenschen. In that
R09 1070  8    case, listen to what befell another wisenheimer who
R09 1080  7    tangled with our joss. A couple of years back, I occupied
R09 1090  6    a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained
R09 1100  2    the type of niche called a "coffin turn". In it was
R09 1110  1    a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay, and
R09 1110 12    occasionally, to make merit, my wife and I garlanded
R09 1120  9    it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap. After
R09 1130  7    a while, we became aware that the money was disappearing
R09 1140  3    as fast as we replenished it. Our suspicions eventually
R09 1150  1    centered, by the process of elimination, on a grocer's
R09 1150 10    boy, a thoroughly bad hat, who delivered cartons to
R09 1160  8    the people overhead. The more I probed into this young
R09 1170  7    man's activities and character, the less savory I found
R09 1180  5    him. I learned, for example, that he made a practice
R09 1190  1    of yapping at dogs he encountered and, in winter, of
R09 1190 11    sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their
R09 1200  9    feet. His energy was prodigious; sometimes he would
R09 1210  4    be up before dawn, clad as a garbage collector and
R09 1220  2    hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us, and thereafter
R09 1220 11    would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions
R09 1230 11    and press cigar butts against their paws. Evenings,
R09 1240  6    he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico
R09 1250  3    + Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning
R09 1260  2    ladies' hats and singing "O Sole Mio". In short, and
R09 1270  2    to borrow an arboreal phrase, slash timber. Well, the
R09 1270 11    odious little toad went along chivying animals and
R09 1280  7    humans who couldn't retaliate, and in due course, as
R09 1290  6    was inevitable, overreached himself. One morning, we
R09 1300  2    discovered not only that the pennies were missing from
R09 1300 11    the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out
R09 1310 10    in its lap. "Now he's bought it", said my wife contentedly.
R09 1320  7    "No divinity will hold still for that. He's really
R09 1330  6    asking for it". And how right she was. The next time
R09 1340  4    we saw him, he was a changed person; he had aged thirty
R09 1350  2    years, and his face, the color of tallow, was crisscrossed
R09 1350 12    with wrinkles, as though it had been wrapped in chicken
R09 1365  9    wire. Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps,
R09 1370  6    he told us in a quavering voice- either an ape specter
R09 1380  7    or Abe Spector, a process-server, we couldn't determine
R09 1390  2    which. His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as
R09 1390 12    Dr. Grimesby Roylott's when he was found before his
R09 1400  9    open safe wearing the speckled band. The grocery the
R09 1410  7    youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect
R09 1420  5    on customers, most of whom were sufficiently neurotic
R09 1430  2    without the threat of incubi, and let him go. The beautiful,
R09 1440  1    the satisfying part of his disintegration, however,
R09 1440  8    was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off. Reduced
R09 1450  8    to beggary, he at last got a job as office boy to a
R09 1460  8    television producer. His hubris, deficiency of taste,
R09 1470  3    and sadism carried him straightaway to the top. He
R09 1470 12    evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos
R09 1480  8    and besmirched whole networks, and quickly superseded
R09 1490  4    his boss. Not long ago, I rode down with him in an
R09 1500  5    elevator in Radio City; he was talking to himself thirteen
R09 1510  2    to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once, clearly
R09 1510 12    a man in extremis. "See that guy"? the operator asked
R09 1520  8    pityingly. "I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the
R09 1530  9    rice in China. There's some kind of a nemesis haunting
R09 1540  7    his footsteps".
R09 1540  9       However one looks at it, therefore, I'd say that
R09 1550  8    your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy.
R09 1560  6    The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be
R09 1570  4    easy to move; you can't very well sidle up to people
R09 1580  1    on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva.
R09 1580 14    Additionally, since you're going to be hors de combat
R09 1590  9    pretty soon with sprue, yaws, Delhi boil, the Granville
R09 1600  7    wilt, liver fluke, bilharziasis, and a host of other
R09 1610  6    complications of the hex you've aroused, you mustn't
R09 1620  2    expect to be lionized socially. My advice, if you live
R09 1620 12    long enough to continue your vocation, is that the
R09 1630  9    next time you're attracted by the exotic, pass it up-
R09 1640  7    it's nothing but a headache. As you can count on me
R09 1650  6    to do the same.
R09 1650 10       compassionately yours,
R09 1660  1       S. J. PERELMAN
R09 1660  4    #REVULSION IN THE DESERT#
R09 1660  8    THE DOORS of the D train slid shut, and as I dropped
R09 1670 11    into a seat and, exhaling, looked up across the aisle,
R09 1680  7    the whole aviary in my head burst into song. She was
R09 1690  5    a living doll and no mistake- the blue-black bang,
R09 1700  1    the wide cheekbones, olive-flushed, that betrayed the
R09 1700  9    Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage, and the
R09 1710  7    mouth whose only fault, in the novelist's carping phrase,
R09 1720  4    was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous.
R09 1730  2    From what I was able to gauge in a swift, greedy glance,
R09 1740  1    the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was
R09 1740 10    stupefying.
