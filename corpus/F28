F28 0010  1    Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest
F28 0010  7    assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions
F28 0020  6    shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied
F28 0030  5    with ... and most particularly in regard to that part
F28 0040  4    of them relative to the completion of your noble and
F28 0040 14    humane views".
F28 0050  2       Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.
F28 0060  1    The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work
F28 0060 12    under John Palfrey's overseer. An excellent crop was
F28 0070  6    expected that year. William, who lived in neighboring
F28 0080  5    St. Mary's parish, had taken charge and decided that
F28 0090  3    it would be best for all if the plantation were operated
F28 0100  1    for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this
F28 0100  9    plan, citing the depressed market for land then prevailing
F28 0110  7    and the large stock of provisions at the plantation.
F28 0120  4    If sold then, the land and improvements might bring
F28 0130  2    only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference
F28 0130 12    with Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning
F28 0140 10    of Gorham's intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but
F28 0150  6    firmly with his brother. The emancipation plan would
F28 0160  5    not only be injurious to all the heirs, he contended,
F28 0170  3    but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless
F28 0180  1    Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves
F28 0180  9    off the plantation, and Louisiana law required their
F28 0190  6    removal from the state. Gorham refused to accept money
F28 0200  5    for slave property, but did he realize how much expense
F28 0210  3    and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the
F28 0220  1    North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out
F28 0220  9    the slaves was not realistic, since no planter would
F28 0230  7    take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were
F28 0240  5    to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid his
F28 0250  2    annoyance, although both he and William were furious
F28 0250 10    with their Yankee brother. William, who did not write
F28 0260  8    to Gorham, told Giffen that unless he could operate
F28 0270  6    the plantation as usual for a year, he would sue "amicably"
F28 0280  3    to protect his interests.
F28 0280  7       Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves
F28 0290  7    be converted to wage laborers during the transition
F28 0300  4    period before emancipation. If William wished to continue
F28 0310  3    operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes
F28 0320  1    undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there
F28 0320 11    as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex
F28 0330  9    + age. A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit
F28 0340  5    would perhaps be a motive with some of them ... to
F28 0350  3    come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our
F28 0350 13    plantation + the adjoining one would be a stronger
F28 0360  9    inducement". When he heard of his brothers' anger,
F28 0370  5    Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded
F28 0380  3    to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was
F28 0380 14    willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that
F28 0390 10    did not block his ultimate aim. William was adamant
F28 0400  7    on one point: under no circumstances would he allow
F28 0410  4    the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and
F28 0420  2    Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.
F28 0420 12    Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against
F28 0430  8    increasing the number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested
F28 0440  7    that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once, and then
F28 0450  7    send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific instructions,
F28 0460  2    he agreed to William's condition.
F28 0460  7       In March there was a division of the slaves, and
F28 0470  9    Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible.
F28 0480  5    Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded in getting
F28 0490  3    a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered
F28 0500  1    that your views would be best carried out", he explained,
F28 0510  1    "by taking women whose progeny will of course be free
F28 0510 11    + more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation.
F28 0520  5    I have also taken the old servants of your father as
F28 0530  5    a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages of the
F28 0540  3    slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant,
F28 0540 13    to an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any
F28 0550 10    doubts about the wickedness of slavery, they were put
F28 0560  7    aside after he received an inventory of the slave property
F28 0570  5    he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human worth
F28 0580  2    in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity,
F28 0580 11    was all he needed. Each human being, known only by
F28 0590  9    a given name, had a cash value. Old Sam's sixty-five
F28 0600  5    years had reduced his value to $150; Rose, a twelve-year-old
F28 0610  6    with child-bearing potential, was worth $400. In rejecting
F28 0620  3    any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey
F28 0630  1    was giving up close to $7,000.
F28 0630  7       Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen
F28 0640  4    Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed
F28 0650  1    that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus
F28 0650 11    twenty "black souls" were to remain ignorant of their
F28 0660  8    imminent journey to the land of free men. Giffen extracted
F28 0670  6    one concession from William: the house servants could
F28 0680  3    be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.
F28 0690  1       Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans
F28 0690  8    for freeing his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he
F28 0700  9    could get the necessary approval, fourteen of his Negroes
F28 0710  5    could not be manumitted without special permission.
F28 0720  2    According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty
F28 0730  1    years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned
F28 0730 10    the state legislature to waive the requirement. Otherwise,
F28 0740  6    freedom would mean removal from the state in which
F28 0750  6    "as the place of their past residence from birth, or
F28 0760  3    for many years, it would ... be materially for their
F28 0760 13    advantage to be at liberty to remain". On March 11
F28 0770 10    the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table
F28 0780  5    the petition. News of the legislative veto appeared
F28 0790  3    in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William became
F28 0800  2    incensed by the fact that they had not been told of
F28 0800 13    the attempt in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's
F28 0810  7    office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier, shouting
F28 0820  6    that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair,
F28 0830  6    and that it would reach the "Ears of the People on
F28 0840  3    the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".
F28 0840 11       His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern,
F28 0850  8    for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself: to
F28 0860  8    free his slaves, and to keep the family from falling
F28 0870  5    apart over the issue. When Giffen decided to charge
F28 0880  3    him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham
F28 0880 12    readily assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars
F28 0890  9    and cents, his brothers would never have any cause
F28 0900  6    to complain of him.
F28 0900 10       in view of these difficulties, Palfrey decided to
F28 0910  5    go to Louisiana. Giffen had already urged him to journey
F28 0920  5    south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.
F28 0930  1    His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged
F28 0930  9    him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature
F28 0940  9    in mid-April. Palfrey told his wife of his intentions
F28 0950  7    for the first time, and left for New Orleans apprehensively
F28 0960  3    invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might
F28 0970  4    be allowed to see his family again.
F28 0970 11       During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two
F28 0980  7    abolitionists. In both cases he desired information
F28 0990  3    about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived
F28 1000  1    in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed
F28 1000 11    him enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from
F28 1010  9    the Legislature of Louisiana, and felt joy at your
F28 1020  8    public recognition of the brotherhood of man". Mrs.
F28 1030  4    Child, who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey
F28 1040  3    a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped
F28 1040 13    one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some
F28 1050  9    years before, but asked him not to advertise the fact
F28 1060  9    in Louisiana. She agreed to take charge of five or
F28 1070  6    six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them
F28 1080  2    north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey
F28 1080  8    consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject,
F28 1090  9    but with no apparent result.
F28 1100  2       Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety,
F28 1110  1    Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial.
F28 1110 10    Instead of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature
F28 1120  9    of his mission, he received many calling cards and
F28 1130  7    invitations from "gentlemen of mark, on whom I had
F28 1140  5    no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations
F28 1150  1    than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund
F28 1150 10    Quincy of the "marked attention and civility" with
F28 1160  7    which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters
F28 1170  6    greeted him. The memory of this southern hospitality
F28 1180  2    did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years
F28 1190  1    and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic
F28 1200  1    account of two perilous days spent among the planters
F28 1200 10    of Attakapas, "many of whom were coarse + passionate
F28 1210  8    people, much excited by what they heard of my plans".
F28 1220  6    He proceeded with his task bravely- in his memoirs,
F28 1230  3    at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should
F28 1240  1    have time to boil too high".
F28 1240  7       Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would
F28 1250  5    allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely
F28 1260  1    whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by
F28 1260 12    remaining behind condemned their children, born and
F28 1270  6    unborn, to bondage. He had a short private talk with
F28 1280  5    each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey soon
F28 1290  2    convinced him that he ought to go with the others.
F28 1290 12    All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed
F28 1300  9    to delay their departure until the end of the planting
F28 1310  7    season, so that they could get in "their own little
F28 1320  3    produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain
F28 1330  1    as wage laborers for his account. William's threat
F28 1330  9    that under no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious"
F28 1340  8    slaves to mix with his own was not carried out, for
F28 1350  8    the plantation continued in operation as before. Palfrey
F28 1360  4    returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have
F28 1370  2    made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment
F28 1370 10    + my conscience".
F28 1380  1       From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest
F28 1390  1    in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time
F28 1390 12    for their departure approached, his solicitousness
F28 1400  4    increased. Should any slave change his mind and request
F28 1410  5    to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage at
F28 1420  2    once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally
F28 1430  1    established, Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would
F28 1440  8    have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard
F28 1450  6    ship. Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate
F28 1460  4    had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.
F28 1470  1    Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what
F28 1470 10    wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation
F28 1480 10    was sold in January, 1845, and Palfrey thought the
F28 1490  6    new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages.
F28 1500  4    Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation
F28 1510  1    for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined
F28 1510 11    to enter into any philanthropic arrangement.
F28 1520  6       On March 21, 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor
F28 1530  5    at New Orleans, while on the levee Henry and William
F28 1540  4    Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels
F28 1550  2    who must have looked back at the receding shore with
F28 1550 12    mingled regret and jubilation.
F28 1560  4       Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw.
F28 1570  4    Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult
F28 1580  1    to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants.
F28 1580 10    Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen
F28 1590  8    filed a petition for permission to emancipate four
F28 1600  5    slaves (all more than fifty years old) with the St.
F28 1610  4    Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection,
F28 1620  1    which he attributed to a "general Excitement against
F28 1620  9    Abolition and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right
F28 1630  7    individuals on the jury, and got the permission without
F28 1640  7    further delay.
F28 1640  9       When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later
F28 1650  8    they were, of course, no longer slaves. Slavery was
F28 1660  4    prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution
F28 1670  3    of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and
F28 1680  1    equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious
F28 1680  7    ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation.
F28 1690  6    An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned
F28 1700  6    colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church
F28 1710  4    doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed
F28 1720  1    while they listened to the few words that declared
F28 1720 10    them free.
F28 1730  1       Once the question of emancipation was settled to
F28 1730  9    Palfrey's satisfaction, he faced a real problem in
F28 1740  7    placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants.
F28 1750  3    Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the
F28 1760  2    Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other
F28 1760 12    attempts. Mrs. Child, true to her word, helped place
F28 1770  9    Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named
F28 1780  3    Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York. This group had
F28 1790  4    been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad
F28 1800  3    health, and her children were too young to work for
F28 1800 13    their keep.
