K08 0010  1       Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost
K08 0010  9    convinced that he should burn his books, too. But while
K08 0020  9    the two men are riding into the country, where they
K08 0030  5    are going to dinner, they are attacked in the dark
K08 0040  3    of the forest by a band of thieves, who strip them
K08 0040 14    of everything, including most of their clothes.
K08 0050  6       "You must be a very learned man", says Voltaire
K08 0060  4    to one of the bandits.
K08 0060  9       "A learned man"? the bandit laughs in his face.
K08 0070  8       But Voltaire perseveres. He goes to the chief himself.
K08 0080  7    "At what university did you study"? he asks. He refuses
K08 0090  6    to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher
K08 0100  4    institution. "To have become so corrupt", he says,
K08 0110  2    "surely you must have studied many arts and sciences".
K08 0120  1       The chief, annoyed by these questions, knocks Voltaire
K08 0120  9    down and shouts at him that he not only never went
K08 0130  9    to any school, but never even learned how to read.
K08 0140  5       When finally the two bedraggled men reach their
K08 0150  2    friend's home, Voltaire's fears are once again aroused.
K08 0160  1    For it is such a distinguished place, with such fine
K08 0160 11    works of art and such a big library, that there can
K08 0170  8    be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved
K08 0180  4    by all this culture.
K08 0180  8       To Voltaire's surprise, however, their host gives
K08 0190  5    them fresh clothes to put on, opens his purse to lend
K08 0200  4    them money and sits them down before a good dinner.
K08 0200 14       Immediately after dinner, however, Rousseau asks
K08 0210  7    for still another favor. Could he have pen and paper,
K08 0220  8    please? He is in a hurry to write another essay against
K08 0230  6    culture.
K08 0230  7       Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls
K08 0240  6    of laughter at Sans Souci and that was soon circulated
K08 0250  3    in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe,
K08 0260  1    to be printed sometime later, but with the name of
K08 0260 11    Timon of Athens, the famous misanthrope, substituted
K08 0270  5    for that of Rousseau.
K08 0280  1       How cruel!
K08 0280  2       But at the same time how understandable. How could
K08 0290  1    the rich, for whom life was made so simple, ever understand
K08 0290 12    the subterfuges, the lies, the frauds, the errors,
K08 0300  7    sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven
K08 0310  6    in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the
K08 0320  2    rich had in the race of life?
K08 0320  9       How, for example, could a Voltaire understand the
K08 0330  6    strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find
K08 0340  3    himself when, soon after the furor of his first Discourse,
K08 0350  1    he acquired still another title to fame?
K08 0350  8       This time as a musician. As a composer.
K08 0360  7       Ever since he had first begun to study music and
K08 0370  5    to teach it, Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through
K08 0380  1    to fame as the result of a successful opera. But his
K08 0380 12    facility in this genre was not great. And his efforts
K08 0390  9    to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably
K08 0400  4    failed. And for good reasons. His operatic music had
K08 0410  4    little merit.
K08 0410  6       But then one day, while on a week's visit to the
K08 0420  5    country home of a retired Swiss jeweler, Rousseau amused
K08 0430  2    the company with a few little melodies he had written,
K08 0430 12    to which he attached no great importance. He was really
K08 0440  9    amazed to discover the other guests so excited about
K08 0450  7    these delicate little songs.
K08 0460  1       "Put a few such songs together", they urged him.
K08 0460 10    "String them onto some sort of little plot, and you'll
K08 0470  9    have a delightful operetta".
K08 0480  1       He didn't believe them. "Nonsense", he said. "This
K08 0490  1    is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away"!
K08 0500  1       "Heaven forbid"! cried the ladies, enchanted by
K08 0500  7    his music. "You must make an opera out of this material".
K08 0510  9       And they wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading
K08 0520  6    until he had promised.
K08 0520 10       Oh, the irony and the bitterness of it! That after
K08 0530 10    all his years of effort to become a composer, he should
K08 0540  7    now, now when he was still stoutly replying to the
K08 0550  4    critics of his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences,
K08 0560  1    be so close to a success in music and have to reject
K08 0560 13    it.
K08 0570  1       Or at least appear to reject it!
K08 0570  8       But what else could he do? You couldn't on the one
K08 0580  6    hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them,
K08 0590  3    could you? Well, yes, perhaps in literature, since
K08 0600  1    you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about
K08 0600 10    your feelings against literature and so were involved
K08 0610  6    in spite of yourself. But now music too? No. That would
K08 0620  5    be too much!
K08 0620  8       And the fault, of course, was Rameau's. The fault
K08 0630  6    was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this
K08 0640  4    Parisian age. For it was Rameau's type of music that
K08 0650  2    he had been trying to write, and that he couldn't write.
K08 0650 13    These little songs, however, were sweet nothings from
K08 0660  8    the heart, tender memories of his childhood, little
K08 0670  6    melodies that anyone could hum and that would make
K08 0680  4    one want to weep.
K08 0680  8       But no. He couldn't appear as a composer now. That
K08 0690  6    glory, craved for so long, was now forbidden to him.
K08 0700  3    Still, just for the ladies, and just for this once,
K08 0700 13    for this one weekend in the country, he would make
K08 0710  9    a little piece out of his melodies.
K08 0720  2       The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded.
K08 0730  1    And everyone went to work to learn the parts which
K08 0730 11    he wrote.
K08 0740  1       But then, after the little operetta had been given
K08 0740 10    its feeble amateur rendering, everyone insisted that
K08 0750  6    it was too good to be lost forever, and that the Royal
K08 0760  6    Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order
K08 0770  3    to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.
K08 0780  1       Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite,
K08 0780 11    standing there and arguing that he could not possibly
K08 0790  9    permit a public performance. The ladies especially
K08 0800  4    couldn't understand what troubled him. A contradiction?
K08 0810  3    Bah, what was a contradiction in one's life? Every
K08 0820  2    woman has had the experience of saying no when she
K08 0820 12    meant yes, and saying yes when she meant no.
K08 0830  8       Rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree
K08 0840  5    to a public performance, he would indeed, just for
K08 0850  3    his own private satisfaction, dearly love to know how
K08 0850 12    his work would sound when done by professional musicians
K08 0860  8    and by trained voices.
K08 0870  1       "I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you
K08 0870 13    kind people seem to think", he said.
K08 0880  6       Duclos, the historian, pointed out to Jean Jacques
K08 0890  5    that this was impossible. The musicians of the Royal
K08 0900  2    Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it
K08 0900 13    would sound. Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.
K08 0910  7       Rousseau agreed. But he recalled that Rameau had
K08 0920  7    once had a private performance of his opera Armide,
K08 0930  5    behind closed doors, just for himself alone.
K08 0940  1       Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau: that
K08 0940  8    the writer of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should
K08 0950  7    now become known as the writer of an amusing little
K08 0960  6    operetta. That would certainly be paradoxical. But
K08 0970  2    Duclos thought he saw a way out.
K08 0970  9       "Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy",
K08 0980  6    he suggested. "Your name will never appear. No one
K08 0990  5    will even suspect that it is your work".
K08 1000  1       To that Rousseau could agree.
K08 1000  6       But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions!
K08 1010  6       Afraid at one and the same time that his work might
K08 1020  5    be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride
K08 1030  1    even though no one knew he was the author- and that
K08 1030 12    the work would be accepted, and then that his violent
K08 1040  8    feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply
K08 1050  5    concerned he was in spite of himself. And how anxious
K08 1060  3    this lover of obscurity was for applause! And thus
K08 1060 12    torn between his desire to be known as the composer
K08 1070 10    of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining
K08 1080  6    true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity, Rousseau
K08 1090  2    suffered through several painful weeks.
K08 1090  7       All these emotions were screwed up to new heights
K08 1100  8    when, after acceptance and the first rehearsals, there
K08 1110  5    ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music
K08 1120  2    lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau
K08 1120 11    to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent
K08 1130 10    of the King's amusements, and that he was now demanding
K08 1140  8    that the work be offered first at the royal summer
K08 1150  6    palace of Fontainebleau. Imagine the honor of it!
K08 1160  3       "What was your answer"? Jean Jacques asked, striving
K08 1170  2    to appear unimpressed.
K08 1170  5       "I refused", Duclos said. "What else could I do?
K08 1180  6    Monsieur de Cury was incensed, of course. But I said
K08 1190  4    I would first have to get the author's permission.
K08 1200  1    And I was certain he would refuse".
K08 1200  8       How infuriating all this was! Why had not this success
K08 1210  8    come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse,
K08 1220  4    and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity
K08 1230  3    and denial? Now, when everything was opening up to
K08 1240  1    him- even the court of Louis XV!- he had to play
K08 1240 11    a role of self-effacement.
K08 1250  3       Back and forth Duclos had to go, between M. de Cury
K08 1260  3    and Jean Jacques and between the Duke d'Aumont and
K08 1260 12    Jean Jacques again, as his little operetta, The Village
K08 1270  9    Soothsayer, though still unperformed, took on ever
K08 1280  7    more importance.
K08 1290  1       And of course the news of who the composer was did
K08 1290 11    finally begin to get around among his closest friends.
K08 1300  6    But they, naturally, kept his secret well, and the
K08 1310  4    public at large knew only of a great excitement in
K08 1310 14    musical and court circles.
K08 1320  4       How titillating it was to go among people who did
K08 1330  3    not know him as the composer, but who talked in the
K08 1330 14    most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after
K08 1340 10    having heard the first rehearsals. The furor was such
K08 1350  6    that people who could not possibly have squirmed their
K08 1360  3    way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were
K08 1370  1    intimate with the whole affair and that it would be
K08 1370 11    sensational. And listening to such a conversation one
K08 1380  7    morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe,
K08 1390  5    Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration, trembling
K08 1400  2    lest his authorship become known, and at the same time
K08 1400 12    dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he
K08 1410 10    should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer.
K08 1420  5       He felt himself now, as he himself says in his Confessions,
K08 1430  5    at a crucial point of his life. And that was why, on
K08 1440  4    the day of the performance, when a carriage from the
K08 1440 14    royal stables called to take him to the palace, he
K08 1450 10    did not bother to shave. On the contrary, he was pleased
K08 1460  7    that his face showed a neglect of several days.
K08 1470  3       Seeing him in that condition, and about to enter
K08 1480  1    the hall where the King, the Queen, the whole royal
K08 1480 11    family and all the members of the highest aristocracy
K08 1490  7    would be present, Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others
K08 1500  5    tried to stop him.
K08 1500  9       "You can't go in that way"! they cried.
K08 1510  7       "Why not"? Jean Jacques asked. "Who is going to
K08 1520  6    stop me"?
K08 1520  8       "You haven't dressed for the occasion"! they pointed
K08 1530  6    out to him.
K08 1530  9       "I'm dressed as I always am", Rousseau said. "Neither
K08 1540  9    better nor worse".
K08 1550  1       "At home, yes", they argued. "But here you are in
K08 1560  2    the palace. There's the King. And Madame de Pompadour".
K08 1560 11       "If they are here, then surely I have the right
K08 1570 11    to be here", Rousseau said. "And even more right. Since
K08 1580  8    I am the composer"!
K08 1590  1       "But in such a slovenly condition".
K08 1590  7       "What is slovenly about me"? Rousseau asked. "Is
K08 1600  8    it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my
K08 1610  6    face? Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself
K08 1630  4    or not. A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard
K08 1640  3    with pride. And those without beards would have stood
K08 1640 12    out as not dressed for the occasion. Now times have
K08 1650  9    changed, and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow
K08 1660  5    on my face. That's the fashion. And fashion is the
K08 1670  4    real king here. Not Louis XV, since even he obeys.
K08 1680  1    Now, if you don't mind, I should like to hear my own
K08 1680 13    piece performed".
K08 1690  1       But of course behind his boldness he didn't feel
K08 1690 10    bold at all. He trembled lest his piece should fail.
K08 1700 10    And this in addition to his usual fear of being among
K08 1710  8    people of high society. His fear of making some inane
K08 1720  5    or inappropriate remark. And even deeper than that:
K08 1730  2    his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly
K08 1730 12    itch to relieve himself. Could he walk out in the midst
K08 1740 10    of his piece? Here, before the court? Before the King?
