H19 0010  1       While there should be no general age limit or restriction
H19 0010 11    to one sex, there will be particular projects requiring
H19 0020  8    special maturity and some open only to men or to women.
H19 0030  9    The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife
H19 0040  6    or family, unless the wife is also accepted for full-time
H19 0050  3    Peace Corps work on the same project.
H19 0050 10       There should be no draft exemption because of Peace
H19 0060  8    Corps service. In most cases service in the Corps will
H19 0070  6    probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment.
H19 0080  2       Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid
H19 0090  3    what they might earn in comparable activities in the
H19 0090 12    United States. Nor would it be possible in many cases
H19 0100 10    for them to live in health or any effectiveness on
H19 0110  6    what their counterparts abroad are paid. The guiding
H19 0120  3    principle indeed should not be anything like compensation
H19 0130  1    for individual services.
H19 0130  4       Rather the principle should be akin to that of the
H19 0140  5    allowance. Peace Corps volunteers should be given just
H19 0150  2    enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living.
H19 0150 11    They should live in modest circumstances, avoiding
H19 0160  6    all conspicuous consumption. Wherever possible they
H19 0170  4    should live with their host country counterparts. Some
H19 0180  2    special health requirements might have to be met. For
H19 0180 11    example, it probably will be necessary for the Corps
H19 0190  9    to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers.
H19 0200  6    Perhaps existing Public Health Service, State Department
H19 0210  4    and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized.
H19 0220  4       For readjustment to the U.S., volunteers should
H19 0230  2    be given some separation allowance at the end of their
H19 0230 12    overseas service, based on the length of time served.
H19 0240  9    #7. IN WHAT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD THE PEACE
H19 0250  6    CORPS BE ESTABLISHED?#
H19 0250  9    The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination
H19 0260  9    of a great many people. Support for it cuts across
H19 0270  6    party, regional, ethnic and other lines. The Peace
H19 0280  3    Corps, therefore, offers an opportunity to add a new
H19 0280 12    dimension to our approach to the world- an opportunity
H19 0290  9    for the American people to think anew and start afresh
H19 0300  8    in their participation in world development.
H19 0310  2       For this, the Peace Corps should be administered
H19 0320  1    by a small, new, alive agency operating as one component
H19 0320 11    in our whole overseas operation.
H19 0330  3       Pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure
H19 0340  3    and program, the Peace Corps should be established
H19 0350  1    as an agency in the Department of State. When the aid
H19 0350 12    operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain
H19 0360  7    a semi-autonomous, functional unit. Meanwhile, the
H19 0370  4    Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA's facilities
H19 0380  4    and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative
H19 0390  4    support and, when needed, program assistance.
H19 0400  1       In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with
H19 0400 11    its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary
H19 0410  9    assistance from those now responsible for United States
H19 0420  6    foreign policy and our overseas operations.
H19 0430  2    #8. HOW AND WHEN SHOULD THE PEACE CORPS BE LAUNCHED?#
H19 0440  1    The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear,
H19 0440 11    with only preparatory work undertaken between now and
H19 0450  6    when Congress finally appropriates special funds for
H19 0460  4    it- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive
H19 0470  3    action, with sufficient funds and made available from
H19 0480  1    existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a
H19 0480  8    number of substantial projects to start this summer.
H19 0490  6       The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that
H19 0500  6    the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people
H19 0510  2    from this year's graduating classes will not be lost.
H19 0510 11    Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer
H19 0520 10    for training on university campuses.
H19 0530  2       If launched in a careful but determined way within
H19 0540  1    the next few weeks, the Peace Corps could have several
H19 0540 11    hundred persons in training this summer for placement
H19 0550  8    next Fall. Within a year or two several thousand might
H19 0560  6    be in service. It can then grow steadily as it proves
H19 0570  4    itself and as the need for it is demonstrated.
H19 0570 13    #9. WHAT WOULD THE FIRST PROJECTS BE?#
H19 0580  7    In the first year there should probably be considerable
H19 0590  4    emphasis on teaching projects. The need here is most
H19 0600  3    clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train
H19 0600 12    qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.
H19 0610 10       There would, however, be a variety of other skills-
H19 0620  8    medical, agricultural, engineering- which would be
H19 0630  6    called for in the first year through the private agency
H19 0640  2    programs and through the provision of technician helpers
H19 0650  1    to existing development projects.
H19 0650  5       The first year's projects should also be spread
H19 0660  5    through several countries in Latin America, Africa
H19 0670  2    and Asia.
H19 0670  4    #10. HOW WILL THE PEACE CORPS BE RECEIVED ABROAD?#
H19 0680  1    Although the need for outside trained manpower exists
H19 0680  9    in every newly developing nation, the readiness to
H19 0690  7    receive such manpower, or to receive it from the United
H19 0700  6    States will vary from country to country. A certain
H19 0710  3    skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected
H19 0720  1    in many quarters. Unfriendly political groups will
H19 0720  8    no doubt do everything in their power to promote active
H19 0730  7    hostility. But there are indications that many developing
H19 0740  4    nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers, and that
H19 0750  3    if the volunteers are well chosen, they will soon demonstrate
H19 0760  1    their value and make many friends.
H19 0760  7       It is important, however, that the Peace Corps be
H19 0770  6    advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution
H19 0780  5    to the world community. In presenting it to other governments
H19 0790  3    and to the United Nations, we could propose that every
H19 0800  2    nation consider the formation of its own peace corps
H19 0800 11    and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form
H19 0810  8    an international coordinating committee. We should
H19 0820  4    hope that peace corps projects will be truly international
H19 0830  2    and that our citizens will find themselves working
H19 0830 10    alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers
H19 0840  9    from other lands. In any case, our Peace Corps personnel
H19 0850  8    should be offered as technician helpers in development
H19 0860  4    projects of the U.N. and other international agencies.
H19 0870  2       The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda
H19 0880  2    venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership.
H19 0890  1    Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach. The Peace
H19 0890 14    Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United
H19 0900 10    States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity
H19 0910  9    to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower.
H19 0920  5    If presented in this spirit, the response and the results
H19 0930  4    will be immeasurably better.
H19 0930  8    #11. HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED?#
H19 0940  2    The already appropriated funds within the discretion
H19 0940  9    of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual
H19 0950 10    Security Act are the only immediately available source
H19 0960  8    of financing this summer's pilot programs of the Peace
H19 0970  6    Corps. If it is decided to make a small shift which
H19 0980  4    may be required from military aid or special assistance
H19 0990  1    funds, in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual
H19 0990 12    Security Act through this new peaceful program, this
H19 1000  8    will be a hopeful sign to the world. Congress should
H19 1010  6    then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative
H19 1020  4    foundation for the next fiscal year.
H19 1020 10       Specifically, Congress should consider authorizing
H19 1030  5    the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American
H19 1040  4    businesses, unions, civic organizations and the public
H19 1050  4    at large. For this must be the project of the whole
H19 1060  1    American people. An Advisory Council of outstanding
H19 1060  8    public figures with experience in world affairs should
H19 1070  7    be formed to give the program continuing guidance and
H19 1080  4    to afford a focal point for public understanding.
H19 1090  1       Steps should also be taken to link the Food for
H19 1090 11    Peace Program with the Peace Corps, so that foreign
H19 1100  9    currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus
H19 1110  7    food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of
H19 1120  8    the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel.
H19 1130  2       The extent to which participating bodies such as
H19 1130 10    U. S. voluntary agencies, universities, international
H19 1140  6    organizations, and the host country or institutions
H19 1150  7    in the host country can and should share the cost of
H19 1160  5    the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored.
H19 1170  1    #12. IS IT WORTH THE COST AND THE RISKS?#
H19 1170 10    No matter how well conceived and efficiently run, there
H19 1180  6    probably will be failures. These could be costly and
H19 1190  5    have a serious effect both at home and abroad.
H19 1200  1       But as the popular response suggests, the potentiality
H19 1200  9    of the Peace Corps is very great. It can contribute
H19 1210  9    to the development of critical countries and regions.
H19 1220  5    It can promote international cooperation and good will
H19 1230  4    toward this country. It can also contribute to the
H19 1240  1    education of America and to more intelligent American
H19 1240  9    participation in the world.
H19 1250  4       With thousands of young Americans going to work
H19 1260  1    in developing areas, millions of Americans will become
H19 1260  9    more directly involved in the world than ever before.
H19 1270  8       With colleges and universities carrying a large
H19 1280  4    part of the program, and with students looking toward
H19 1290  2    Peace Corps service, there will be an impact on educational
H19 1300  1    curriculum and student seriousness. The letters home,
H19 1300  8    the talks later given by returning members of the Peace
H19 1310  8    Corps, the influence on the lives of those who spend
H19 1320  7    two or three years in hard work abroad- all this may
H19 1330  6    combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible
H19 1340  1    American policies toward the world. And this is meeting
H19 1340 10    the world's need, too, since what the world most needs
H19 1350  9    from this country is better understanding of the world.
H19 1360  7       The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to
H19 1370  6    America's world policy- one for which people here and
H19 1380  3    abroad have long been waiting. As you said in your
H19 1380 13    State of the Union message. "The problems ... are towering
H19 1390 10    and unprecedented- and the response must be towering
H19 1400  9    and unprecedented as well".
H19 1420  1    #TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:#
H19 1420  8    I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a
H19 1430  5    permanent Peace Corps- a pool of trained American men
H19 1440  3    and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through
H19 1450  3    private organizations and institutions to help foreign
H19 1460  1    countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower.
H19 1460  9       I have today signed an Executive Order establishing
H19 1470  8    a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis.
H19 1480  5       The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information
H19 1490  5    and experience to aid us in formulating more effective
H19 1500  2    plans for a permanent organization. In addition, by
H19 1500 10    starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin
H19 1510 11    training young men and women for overseas duty this
H19 1520  6    summer with the objective of placing them in overseas
H19 1530  3    positions by late fall. This temporary Peace Corps
H19 1530 11    is being established under existing authority in the
H19 1540  8    Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department
H19 1550  9    of State. Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations
H19 1560  6    currently available for our foreign aid program.
H19 1570  3       Throughout the world the people of the newly developing
H19 1580  2    nations are struggling for economic and social progress
H19 1580 10    which reflects their deepest desires. Our own freedom,
H19 1590  8    and the future of freedom around the world, depend,
H19 1600  7    in a very real sense, on their ability to build growing
H19 1610  4    and independent nations where men can live in dignity,
H19 1620  1    liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance and poverty.
H19 1630  1       One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement
H19 1630  9    of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with
H19 1640  9    the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation
H19 1650  5    of development projects- men and women with the capacity
H19 1660  3    to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics,
H19 1670  1    and with the dedication to put that capacity to work
H19 1670 11    in the villages, the mountains, the towns and the factories
H19 1680  8    of dozens of struggling nations.
H19 1690  1       The vast task of economic development urgently requires
H19 1700  1    skilled people to do the work of the society- to help
H19 1700 12    teach in the schools, construct development projects,
H19 1710  5    demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages,
H19 1720  5    and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training
H19 1730  3    and advanced knowledge.
H19 1730  6       To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we
H19 1740  5    are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps- an
H19 1750  2    organization which will recruit and train American
H19 1750  9    volunteers, sending them abroad to work with the people
H19 1760  9    of other nations.
H19 1770  1       This organization will differ from existing assistance
H19 1770  8    programs in that its members will supplement technical
H19 1780  8    advisers by offering the specific skills needed by
H19 1790  5    developing nations if they are to put technical advice
H19 1800  2    to work. They will help provide the skilled manpower
H19 1800 11    necessary to carry out the development projects planned
H19 1810  8    by the host governments, acting at a working level
H19 1820  6    and serving at great personal sacrifice. There is little
H19 1830  4    doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will
H19 1840  2    be far greater than our capacity to absorb them.
