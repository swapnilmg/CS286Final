A34 0010  1    #FOR CRUCIAL ENCOUNTER#
A34 0010  4    One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy
A34 0020  2    at his first news conference last January was about
A34 0020 11    his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev.
A34 0030  8    Mr. Kennedy replied:
A34 0040  2       @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional exchanges
A34 0050  2    we can perhaps find greater common ground".
A34 0050  9       The President knew that a confrontation with Mr.
A34 0060  8    Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable
A34 0070  5    and even desirable. But he was convinced that the realities
A34 0080  4    of power- military, economic and ideological- were
A34 0090  4    the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists
A34 0090 13    and that these could not be talked away at a heads
A34 0100 10    of government meeting. He wanted to buy time to strengthen
A34 0110  7    the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to
A34 0120  6    implement his foreign policy.
A34 0120 10       Last Friday the White House announced:
A34 0130  5       President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier
A34 0150  4    Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4.
A34 0160  2       The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration
A34 0170  1    in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in
A34 0170  9    fact, had been a major factor in the President's change
A34 0180  8    of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet
A34 0190  7    leader. He was not going to Vienna to negotiate- the
A34 0200  4    simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow
A34 0210  1    last week stressed that no formal negotiations were
A34 0210  9    planned. But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that
A34 0220  7    a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might
A34 0230  4    be the only way to prevent catastrophe.
A34 0240  1       That objective set the high stakes and drama of
A34 0240 10    the Vienna meeting. Despite efforts by Washington last
A34 0250  6    week to play down the significance of the meeting,
A34 0260  4    it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters
A34 0270  1    of the cold war. @
A34 0270  6    #ROAD TO VIENNA#
A34 0270  9    The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three
A34 0280  8    times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced
A34 0290  5    a new word into international diplomacy with his call
A34 0300  4    for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the
A34 0310  1    summit of the nations".
A34 0310  5       The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big
A34 0320  4    Four summit meeting produced the "spirit of Geneva".
A34 0330  1    The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow
A34 0330 11    made inroads into the Middle East.
A34 0340  5       In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev
A34 0350  4    held an informal session in the U. S. That meeting
A34 0360  3    produced the "spirit of Camp David"- a spirit, it later
A34 0370  2    turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about
A34 0370 10    progress toward a Berlin settlement.
A34 0380  5       On the third occasion- another Big Four summit session
A34 0390  5    at Paris a year ago- there was no problem of an illusory
A34 0400  4    "spirit". Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference
A34 0410  1    at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of
A34 0410 10    the U. S. for the U-2 incident. The episode tended
A34 0420  9    to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda, the hope
A34 0430  7    of one-sided concessions, and the chance to split the
A34 0440  6    Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were the Soviet
A34 0450  3    leader's real aims in summitry.
A34 0450  8    #PRE-INAUGURAL POSITION#
A34 0460  1    Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before
A34 0460  8    inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with
A34 0470  9    the new President, Mr. Kennedy was confronted with
A34 0480  5    a delicate problem. Shortly before his nomination he
A34 0490  3    had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations
A34 0500  1    with the Soviet leader in these words:
A34 0500  8       "As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the
A34 0510  8    balance of world power is shifting his way, no amount
A34 0520  6    of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp David talks
A34 0530  3    nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful
A34 0535  1    negotiations".
A34 0540  1       The President had set for himself the task, which
A34 0550  1    he believed vital, of awakening the U. S. and its allies
A34 0550 12    to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that
A34 0560 10    balance. He did not want the effort weakened by any
A34 0570  8    illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary.
A34 0580  3    He wanted time, too, to review the United States' global
A34 0590  2    commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited
A34 0600  1    and new ones he was formulating. Above all, he did
A34 0600 11    not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier
A34 0610  9    Khrushchev's doorstep.
A34 0610 11    #ATTITUDE FLEXIBLE#
A34 0620  2    At the same time the President took pains not to rule
A34 0630  2    out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader. Ideally,
A34 0630 11    he knew, it should be preceded by concrete progress
A34 0640  8    at lower levels. But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in
A34 0650  6    an informal meeting, provided that undue hopes were
A34 0660  3    not raised in connection with it. It would give him
A34 0660 13    an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary
A34 0670 10    in the cold war, to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions
A34 0680  8    and to make clear his own views. Moreover, an eventual
A34 0690  7    meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to
A34 0700  5    satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible
A34 0710  2    and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.
A34 0720  1       Both elements- the caution about a meeting, the
A34 0720  9    willingness eventually to hold one- were reflected
A34 0730  7    in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn
A34 0740  4    E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February.
A34 0750  4    The letter, dated Feb. 22, was delivered to Premier
A34 0760  2    Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9. It
A34 0760 10    dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues.
A34 0770 10    But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a
A34 0780  6    meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year
A34 0790  6    if the international climate were favorable and schedules
A34 0800  2    permitted.
A34 0800  3       Developments over the next two months, however,
A34 0810  1    caused the President to reconsider the question of
A34 0810  9    the timing. There were intense discussions in the inner
A34 0820  8    councils of the White House about the advisability
A34 0830  4    of an early meeting, not because the international
A34 0840  1    climate was improving, but precisely because it was
A34 0840  9    deteriorating alarmingly.
A34 0850  2    #DEADLOCK ON TESTS#
A34 0850  5    The President was especially concerned about the deadlock
A34 0860  5    in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva. The
A34 0870  3    deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand
A34 0880  1    for a three-man (East, West and neutral) directorate,
A34 0880 10    and thus a veto, over the control machinery. In the
A34 0890  7    U. S., strong pressures have been building up for a
A34 0900  7    resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may
A34 0910  2    be secretly testing.
A34 0910  5       Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility
A34 0920  4    than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown, or even
A34 0930  3    continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread
A34 0930 10    of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a
A34 0940  9    fatal blow to any hope for disarmament. There was reason
A34 0950  4    to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned
A34 0960  3    about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly
A34 0970  1    to Communist China. The question arose as to whether
A34 0970 10    a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader
A34 0980  8    had not become urgent. Moreover, Moscow appeared determined
A34 0990  4    to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive
A34 1000  4    organs of all international bodies, including the U.
A34 1010  3    N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission
A34 1020  1    for Laos. Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence
A34 1020  9    on the demand would make international agreements,
A34 1030  5    or even negotiations, impossible.
A34 1040  1       Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the
A34 1040  9    advisability of an early summit meeting. Initially
A34 1050  7    the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges
A34 1060  6    with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had
A34 1070  4    dampened prospects for a meeting. At the same time,
A34 1080  1    there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest
A34 1080 10    the Soviet leader, as a result of those episodes, come
A34 1090  8    to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's
A34 1100  4    ability and determination to resist Communist pressure.
A34 1110  2       In Cuba, the U. S. had blundered badly and created
A34 1120  2    the impression of impotency against Communist penetration
A34 1120  9    even on its own doorstep. In Laos, the picture was
A34 1130 10    almost equally bad. U. S. willingness to accept a neutral
A34 1140  8    Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that
A34 1150  5    other areas could be "neutralized" on Soviet terms.
A34 1160  4    Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention
A34 1170  1    in Laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed
A34 1180  1    Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military
A34 1180 11    and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the
A34 1190  6    pro-Communist forces. As a result, the West is in a
A34 1200  6    poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations
A34 1210  2    on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast
A34 1220  1    Asia are under increased pressure.
A34 1220  6       In the light of those events, there appeared to
A34 1230  5    be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach
A34 1240  3    himself. Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that
A34 1250  2    the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.
A34 1250 10    He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin
A34 1260  8    before the year is out. The President and his advisers
A34 1270  5    felt that the time might have come to warn Premier
A34 1280  2    Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas
A34 1280  9    such as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there
A34 1290 10    would be no turning back.
A34 1300  2       It was in the midst of such White House deliberations
A34 1310  1    that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries
A34 1310 10    through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting
A34 1320  9    with the President in the near future. Mr. Kennedy
A34 1330  6    told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after
A34 1340  5    consultation with the Allies. The response from London,
A34 1350  2    Paris and Bonn was favorable. Firm arrangements for
A34 1350 10    the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange
A34 1360 10    between Moscow and Washington last week. Apparently
A34 1370  5    at the insistence of the U. S., the simultaneous announcements
A34 1380  4    issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized
A34 1390  4    the "informal" nature of the meeting. The Washington
A34 1400  2    announcement said:
A34 1400  4       @ "The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand
A34 1410  3    that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating
A34 1420  3    or reaching agreement on the major international problems
A34 1430  1    that involve the interest of many other countries.
A34 1430  9    The meeting will, however, afford a timely and convenient
A34 1440  8    opportunity for the first personal contact between
A34 1450  4    them and a general exchange of views on the major issues
A34 1460  3    which affect the relationships between the two countries".

A34 1470  2    #THE OUTLOOK#
A34 1470  4    The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned,
A34 1480  1    67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr. Kennedy's
A34 1490  1    own words, is "shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed
A34 1490  9    and confident", and a 44-year-old President (his birthday
A34 1500  9    is May 29) with a demonstrated capacity for political
A34 1510  5    battle but little experience in international diplomacy.
A34 1520  2    The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter
A34 1530  2    produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval
A34 1540  1    and disapproval.
A34 1540  3       The approval did not arise from an expectation of
A34 1550  2    far-reaching agreements at Vienna. The inclination
A34 1550  9    was to accept the statement that there would be no
A34 1560  8    formal negotiations. But those who were in favor of
A34 1570  6    the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the
A34 1580  2    two men and an opportunity to size one another up would
A34 1580 13    prove salutary. Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily
A34 1590  8    on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a
A34 1600  7    shrewd judge of men. The feeling was that he would
A34 1610  4    sense an inner core of toughness and determination
A34 1610 12    in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy
A34 1620  9    would give him pause.
A34 1630  1       Apart from the personal equation, another reason
A34 1630  8    advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often
A34 1640 10    in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged
A34 1650  6    reluctantly to the summit. Premier Khrushchev has made
A34 1660  3    propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end
A34 1660 13    got his summit meeting anyway. This time the initiative
A34 1670  9    came, in part at least, from Washington.
A34 1680  5    #OTHER ALLIES CONSULTED#
A34 1680  8    There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr.
A34 1690 10    Khrushchev, the President will have completed conversations
A34 1700  5    with all the other principal Allied leaders. Thus he
A34 1710  4    will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader
A34 1720  1    of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.
A34 1730  1       Finally, there was a wide area of agreement on the
A34 1730 10    value of the President's making a final effort in the
A34 1740  7    summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord. There is
A34 1750  4    no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings
A34 1760  1    throughout the world. If tests are to be resumed, the
A34 1760 11    argument went, it is vital that the U. S. make plain
A34 1770 10    that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union.
A34 1780  4       Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on
A34 1790  2    the belief that the timing could hardly be worse. After
A34 1790 12    Cuba and Laos, it was argued, Mr. Khrushchev will interpret
A34 1800 10    the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence
A34 1810  8    of Western weakness- perhaps even panic- and is certain
A34 1820  9    to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he
A34 1830  5    holds. Moreover, the President is meeting the Soviet
A34 1840  2    leader at a time when the Administration has still
A34 1840 11    not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign
A34 1850  8    policy commitments. The question was raised, for example,
A34 1860  6    as to what attitude the President would take if Mr.
A34 1870  5    Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending
A34 1880  1    from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.
