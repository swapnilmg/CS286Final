G53 0010  1    SAMUEL GORTON, founder of Warwick, was styled by the
G53 0010 10    historian Samuel Greene Arnold "one of the most remarkable
G53 0020  9    men who ever lived". A biographer called him "the premature
G53 0030  7    John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism".
G53 0040  4    The historian Charles Francis Adams called him "a crude
G53 0050  6    and half-crazy thinker". His contemporaries in Massachusetts
G53 0060  3    called him an arch-heretic, a beast, a miscreant, a
G53 0070  2    proud and pestilent seducer, a prodigious minter of
G53 0070 10    exorbitant novelties. Edward Rawson, secretary of the
G53 0080  7    colony of Massachusetts Bay, described him as "a man
G53 0090  7    whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies and insolence,
G53 0100  3    a corrupter of the truth, a disturber of the peace
G53 0110  1    wherever he comes". Nathaniel Morton stated he "was
G53 0110  9    deeply leavened with blasphemous and familistical opinions".
G53 0120  6    He was thrown out, more or less, from Boston, Plymouth,
G53 0130  8    Pocasset, Newport, and Providence.
G53 0140  1       On the other hand, Dr. Ezra Styles recorded the
G53 0150  1    following testimony of John Angell, the last disciple
G53 0150  9    of Gorton: "
G53 0160  1       He said Gorton was a holy man; wept day and night
G53 0160 12    for the sins and blindness of the world ... had a long
G53 0170 12    walk through the trees and woods by his house, where
G53 0180  7    he constantly walked morning and evening, and even
G53 0190  3    in the depths of the night, alone by himself, for contemplation
G53 0200  1    and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light. He
G53 0200 10    was universally beloved by his neighbours, and the
G53 0210  7    Indians, who esteemed him, not only as a friend, but
G53 0220  7    one high in communion with God in Heaven". Gorton sometimes
G53 0230  3    signed himself "a professor of the mysteries of Christ".
G53 0240  2       There is plenty more to recommend Gorton, the facts
G53 0250  1    of whose life are given in The Life and Times of Samuel
G53 0250 13    Gorton, by Adelos Gorton. He fought like a fiend for
G53 0260 10    the helpless and oppressed, worked for the abolition
G53 0270  6    of slavery, helped the Quakers and Indians, and worked
G53 0280  5    against the prosecution of witches. He defied the Boston
G53 0290  3    hierarchy, and after they sent a small army to get
G53 0290 13    him he befuddled the court, including John Cotton,
G53 0300  8    with one of the most complicated religious discourses
G53 0310  4    ever heard.
G53 0310  6       Samuel Gorton was born at Gorton, England, near
G53 0320  6    the present city of Manchester, about 1592. Although
G53 0330  3    he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities,
G53 0340  1    he was a master of Greek and Hebrew and could read
G53 0340 12    the Bible in the original. He worked as a "clothier"
G53 0350  9    in London, but was greatly concerned with religion.
G53 0360  4       Gorton left England, he said, "to enjoy libertie
G53 0370  4    of conscience in respect to faith towards God, and
G53 0380  2    for no other end". With his wife and three or more
G53 0380 13    children he arrived in Boston in March, 1637, and soon
G53 0390  9    found it was no place for anyone looking for liberty
G53 0400  5    of conscience. Roger Williams had recently been thrown
G53 0410  3    out, and Anne Hutchinson and her Antinomians were slugging
G53 0420  1    it out with the powers-that-be. Gorton and his family
G53 0420 12    moved to Plymouth.
G53 0430  2       Soon he was in trouble there, for defending a woman
G53 0440  1    who was accused of smiling in church. She was Ellen
G53 0440 11    Aldridge, a widow of good repute who was employed by
G53 0450  8    Gorton's wife and lived with the family. The report
G53 0460  5    was: "
G53 0460  6       It had been whispered privately that she had smiled
G53 0470  5    in the congregation, and the Governor Prence sent to
G53 0480  3    knoe her business, and command, after punishment as
G53 0480 11    the bench see fit, her departure and also anyone who
G53 0490  9    brought her "to the place from which she came"". Gorton
G53 0500  6    said they were preparing to deport her as a vagabond,
G53 0510  5    and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for several
G53 0520  2    days, returning at night. He advised the poor woman
G53 0520 11    not to appear in court as what she was charged with
G53 0530 10    was not in violation of law. Gorton appeared for her,
G53 0540  6    however, and what he told the magistrates must have
G53 0550  3    been plenty, for he was charged with deluding the court,
G53 0560  1    fined, and told to leave the colony within fourteen
G53 0560 10    days. He left in a storm for Pocasset, December 4,
G53 0570  7    1638. His wife was in delicate health and nursing an
G53 0580  4    infant with measles.
G53 0580  7       The unconquerable Mrs. Hutchinson was residing at
G53 0590  5    Pocasset, after having been excommunicated by the Boston
G53 0600  4    church and thrown out of the colony. One can imagine
G53 0610  1    that with her and Gorton there it was no place for
G53 0610 12    anyone with weak nerves. William Coddington, who was
G53 0620  7    running the colony, felt constrained to move seven
G53 0630  4    miles south where, with others- as mentioned above-
G53 0640  1    he founded Newport. When, in March, 1640, the two towns
G53 0650  1    were united under Coddington, Gorton claimed the union
G53 0650  9    was irregular and illegally constituted and that it
G53 0660  7    had never been sanctioned by the majority of freeholders.
G53 0670  4       Then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar
G53 0680  3    to the one in Plymouth. A cow owned by an old woman
G53 0690  1    trespassed on Gorton's land. While driving the cow
G53 0690  9    back home the woman was assaulted by a servant maid
G53 0700  8    of Gorton. The old woman complained to the deputy governor,
G53 0710  5    who ordered the servant brought before the court. Gorton
G53 0720  4    reverted to his Plymouth tactics, refused to let her
G53 0730  2    go, and appeared himself before the Portsmouth grand
G53 0730 10    jury. During the trial he told off the jury, called
G53 0740  9    them "Just Asses" and called a freeman "a saucy boy
G53 0750  7    and Jack-an-Apes". He was jailed and banished.
G53 0760  3       Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the
G53 0770  1    town in a turmoil. He held that no group of colonists
G53 0770 12    could set up or maintain a government without royal
G53 0780  7    sanction. Since Rhode Island at that time did not have
G53 0790  7    such sanction, his opinion was not popular. Roger Williams
G53 0800  3    wrote his friend Winthrop as follows: "
G53 0810  1       Master Gorton, having foully abused high and low
G53 0810  8    at Aquidneck is now bewitching and bemaddening poor
G53 0820  5    Providence, both with his unclean and foul censures
G53 0830  3    of all the ministers of this country (for which myself
G53 0840  1    have in Christ's name withstood him), and also denying
G53 0840 10    all visible and external ordinances in depth of Familism:
G53 0850  8    almost all suck in his poison, as at first they did
G53 0860  8    at Aquidneck. Some few and myself withstand his inhabitation
G53 0870  3    and town privileges, without confession and reformation
G53 0880  2    of his uncivil and inhuman practices at Portsmouth;
G53 0880 10    yet the tide is too strong against us, and I fear (if
G53 0890 12    the framer of hearts help not) it will force me to
G53 0900  8    little Patience, a little isle next to your Prudence".
G53 0910  4    Williams also stated: "Our peace was like the peace
G53 0920  3    of a man who hath the tertian ague".
G53 0920 11       Providence finally managed to get Gorton out of
G53 0930  7    the town, and he and some friends bought land at Pawtuxet
G53 0940  5    on the west side of Narragansett Bay, five miles south
G53 0950  3    but still within the jurisdiction of the Providence
G53 0950 11    colony. This town should not be confused with Pawtucket,
G53 0960  9    just north of Providence, or Pawcatuck, Connecticut,
G53 0970  4    on the Pawcatuck River, opposite Westerly, Rhode Island.
G53 0980  4       Up to now, Gorton had been looking for trouble,
G53 0990  3    and now that he was trying to get away from it, trouble
G53 1000  1    started looking for him. Upon intelligence that the
G53 1000  9    formidable agitator was to favor them with his presence,
G53 1010  9    the benighted inhabitants of Pawtuxet, alas, gave their
G53 1020  6    allegiance to Massachusetts and asked that colony to
G53 1030  4    expel the newcomers. As it was the custom of that alert
G53 1040  1    colony to take over the property of persons asking
G53 1040 10    for protection, this was an act roughly equivalent
G53 1050  7    to throwing open the door to a pack of wolves and saying
G53 1060  5    "Come and get it".
G53 1060  9       Gorton and company, however, promptly bought land
G53 1070  5    from Miantonomi a few miles south of Pawtuxet, extending
G53 1080  4    from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick Neck
G53 1090  2    and twenty miles inland. The settlement was called
G53 1090 10    Shawomet. It was not within the jurisdiction of anybody
G53 1100  9    or anything, including Providence and Massachusetts.
G53 1110  4    If Gorton wanted peace and quiet for his complicated
G53 1120  4    meditations this is where he should have had it. Instead
G53 1130  1    of that he was engulfed by bedlam.
G53 1130  8       Pomham and Soconoco, a couple of minor sachems (of
G53 1140  7    something less than exalted character) under Miantonomi,
G53 1150  3    declared that they had never assented to the sale of
G53 1160  2    land to Gorton and had never received anything for
G53 1160 11    it. Following the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet,
G53 1170  9    they also submitted themselves to the protection of
G53 1180  5    Massachusetts. One historical authority presents laborious
G53 1190  3    and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion
G53 1200  1    that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down
G53 1200  9    on the embattled Gorton.
G53 1210  2       However, the General Court at Boston ordered the
G53 1220  2    purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer
G53 1220 11    the sachems' claim. The purchasers rejected the order
G53 1230  7    in two letters written in vigorous terms. Then Massachusetts
G53 1240  6    switched to its standard tactics. It pointed out twenty-six
G53 1250  6    instances of blasphemy in the letters, and ordered
G53 1260  3    the writers to submit or force of arms would be used.
G53 1260 14    The next week, forty soldiers were sent to get the
G53 1270 10    miscreants. The latter tried to arbitrate through a
G53 1280  6    delegation from Providence, which offer was declined
G53 1290  3    by the invaders. The Commissioners at Boston wrote
G53 1300  1    the victims to see their misdeeds and repent or they
G53 1300 11    should "look upon them as men prepared for slaughter".
G53 1310  7       At Shawomet, women and children fled in terror across
G53 1320  7    the Bay. The men fortified a blockhouse and got ready
G53 1330  4    to fight, but meanwhile appealed to the King and again
G53 1340  2    tried to arbitrate. Gorton evidently still had plenty
G53 1340 10    to learn about Massachusetts, but he was learning fast.
G53 1350  8    Governor Winthrop wrote: "
G53 1360  1       You may do well to take notice, that besides the
G53 1360 11    title to land between the English and the Indians there,
G53 1370 10    there are twelve of the English that have subscribed
G53 1380  7    their names to horrible and detestable blasphemies,
G53 1390  2    who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than they
G53 1400  2    should delude us by winning time under pretence of
G53 1400 11    arbitration".
G53 1410  1       The attack started on October 2, 1643, and the Gortonists
G53 1410 11    held out for a day and a night. The attackers sent
G53 1420 11    for more soldiers, and the defenders, to save bloodshed,
G53 1430  6    surrendered under the promise that they would be treated
G53 1440  5    as neighbors. Promptly their livestock was taken and
G53 1450  2    according to Gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock
G53 1450 11    down anyone who should utter a word of insolence, and
G53 1460  9    run through anyone who might step out of line.
G53 1470  6       When the captives arrived in Boston, "the chaplain
G53 1480  3    [of their captors] went to prayers in the open streets,
G53 1490  1    that the people might take notice what they had done
G53 1490 11    in a holy manner, and in the name of the Lord". Gorton
G53 1500  9    and ten of his friends were thrown in jail.
G53 1510  5       On Sunday they refused to attend church. The magistrates
G53 1520  3    were determined to compel them. The prisoners agreed,
G53 1530  1    provided they might speak after the sermon, which was
G53 1530 10    permitted. Here was Gorton's chance to indulge in something
G53 1540  8    at which he was supreme. The Boston elders were great
G53 1550  6    at befuddling the opposition with torrents of ecclesiastical
G53 1560  4    obscurities, but Gorton was better. Reverend Cotton
G53 1570  2    preached to them about Demetrius and the shrines of
G53 1570 11    Ephesus. Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized
G53 1580  7    the congregation.
G53 1590  1       At the trial which took place later, the Pomham
G53 1590 10    matter was completely omitted. The Gortonists were
G53 1600  5    charged with blasphemy and tried for their lives. Four
G53 1610  5    ecclesiastical questions were presented by the General
G53 1620  2    Court to Gorton: "
G53 1620  5    _1._
G53 1620  6       Whether the Fathers, who died before Christ was
G53 1630  5    born of the Virgin Mary, were justified and saved only
G53 1640  3    by the blood which hee shed, and the death which hee
G53 1640 14    suffered after his incarnation?
G53 1650  4    _2._
G53 1650  5       Whether the only price of our redemption were not
G53 1660  4    the death of Christ on the cross, with the rest of
G53 1670  2    his sufferings and obediences, in the time of his life
G53 1670 12    here, after hee was born of the Virgin Mary?
G53 1680  8    _3._
G53 1680  9       Who was the God whom hee thinke we serve?
G53 1690  4    _4._
G53 1690  5       What hee means when hee saith, wee worship the starre
G53 1700  3    of our God Remphan, Chion, Moloch"?
G53 1700  9       Gorton answered in writing. All of the elders except
G53 1710  9    three voted for death, but a majority of the deputies
G53 1720  7    refused to sanction the sentence. Seven of the prisoners
G53 1730  5    were sentenced to be confined in irons for as long
G53 1740  2    as it pleased the court, set to work and, if they broke
G53 1740 14    jail or proclaimed heresy, to be executed if convicted.
G53 1750  7    The three others got off easier. The convicts were
G53 1760  5    put in chains, paraded before the congregation at the
G53 1770  3    Reverend Cotton's lecture as an example, and sent to
G53 1780  1    prisons in various towns, where they languished all
G53 1780  9    winter, chains included.
