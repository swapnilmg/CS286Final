J42 0010  1       In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations
J42 0010 12    became international law. Several factors contributed
J42 0020  5    to this change.
J42 0020  8       The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting
J42 0030  8    point because it both epitomized and symbolized what
J42 0040  5    was to follow. Here in 1815 the great nations assembled
J42 0050  3    to legislate not merely for Europe, but for the world.
J42 0060  1    Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the
J42 0060 10    political system that was central to world politics
J42 0070  7    for a century. International law had to fit the conditions
J42 0080  7    of Europe, and nothing that could not fit this system,
J42 0090  2    or the interests of the great European nations collectively,
J42 0100  1    could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense.
J42 0100 10    Essentially this imposed two conditions: First, international
J42 0110  7    law had to recognize and be compatible with an international
J42 0120  7    political system in which a number of states were competitive,
J42 0130  7    suspicious, and opportunistic in their political alignments
J42 0140  5    with one another; second, it had to be compatible with
J42 0150  4    the value system that they shared. In both respects,
J42 0160  1    international law was Europeanized.
J42 0160  5       It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine
J42 0170  6    which would square the two conditions. On the one hand,
J42 0180  5    the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis
J42 0190  1    each other an emphasis upon sovereignty, independence,
J42 0190  8    formal equality- thus insuring for themselves individually
J42 0200  8    an optimal freedom of action to maintain the "flexibility
J42 0210  6    of alignment" that the system required and to avoid
J42 0220  5    anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous
J42 0230  1    Napoleonic experience. But there was no pressing need
J42 0230  9    to maintain these same standards with regard to most
J42 0240  8    of the rest of the world. Thus, theory and doctrine
J42 0250  5    applicable among the great nations and the smaller
J42 0260  2    European states did not really comfortably fit less
J42 0260 10    developed and less powerful societies elsewhere. Political
J42 0270  7    interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America
J42 0280  8    (though limited in Latin America by the special interest
J42 0290  5    of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine,
J42 0300  4    itself from the outset related to European politics
J42 0310  1    and long dependent upon the "balance of power" system
J42 0310 10    in Europe) was necessary in order to preserve both
J42 0320  8    common economic values and the European "balance" itself.
J42 0330  6    A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by
J42 0340  5    agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality;
J42 0350  3    more doubtful, but possible, (with an assist from the
J42 0360  1    North) was the neutralization of the Latin American
J42 0360  9    countries; out of the question was the neutralization
J42 0370  8    of Asia and Africa.
J42 0380  1       This Europeanization of the law was made explicit
J42 0380  9    by a number of 19th century scholars. More emphasis
J42 0390  6    was put upon the fact that international law was the
J42 0400  4    law of "civilized nations"; Kent and Story, the great
J42 0410  3    early American scholars, repeatedly made use of this
J42 0410 11    phrase, or of "Christian nations", which is a substantial
J42 0420  9    equivalent. Wheaton stated that the public law was
J42 0430  8    essentially "limited to the civilized and Christian
J42 0440  4    peoples of Europe or to those of European origin".
J42 0450  2    Of course it had always been of European origin in
J42 0450 12    fact, but it had maintained a universal outlook under
J42 0460  9    the natural law theory. Now, with virtually every writer,
J42 0470  6    not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged
J42 0480  5    as a historical phenomenon, but the rules thus established
J42 0490  3    by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be
J42 0490 12    imposed on others. The European customs on which international
J42 0500  9    law was based were to become, by force and fiat, the
J42 0510 10    customs that others were to accept as law if they were
J42 0520  8    to join this community as sovereign states. Hall, for
J42 0530  3    example, was quite explicit on this point when he said
J42 0540  1    "states outside European civilization must formally
J42 0540  7    enter into the circle of law-governed countries. They
J42 0550  7    must do something with the acquiescence of the latter,
J42 0560  5    or some of them, which amounts to an acceptance of
J42 0570  2    the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of
J42 0570 11    misconstruction".
J42 0580  1    During the nineteenth century these views were protested
J42 0580  9    by virtually all the Latin American writers, though
J42 0590  8    ineffectively, just as the new nations of Africa and
J42 0600  8    Asia protest them, with more effect, today.
J42 0610  2       A number of other nineteenth-century developments
J42 0611  1    contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations
J42 0620  9    into international law; that is, from aspects of a
J42 0630  8    universal system of Justice into particular rules governing
J42 0640  4    the relations of sovereign states. The difference is
J42 0650  2    important, for although the older law of nations did
J42 0650 11    cover relationships among sovereigns, this was by no
J42 0660  8    means its exclusive domain. The law of nature governed
J42 0670  6    sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens,
J42 0680  4    to foreigners, and to each other in a conceptually
J42 0690  1    unified system. The theory of international law, which
J42 0690  9    in the nineteenth century became common to virtually
J42 0700  6    all writers in Europe and America, broke this unity
J42 0710  4    and this universality. It lost sight of the individual
J42 0720  2    almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting
J42 0720 10    the exercise of state power for reasons essentially
J42 0730  7    unconnected with justice or morality save as these
J42 0740  6    values might affect international relations. No longer
J42 0750  3    did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine
J42 0760  1    what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules
J42 0760 12    that might limit his freedom of action.
J42 0770  5       To appreciate this development, we must relate it
J42 0780  4    to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy.
J42 0780 11    First, and most obvious, was the growing nationalism
J42 0790  8    and the tendency to regard the state, and the individual's
J42 0800  7    identification with the state, as transcending other
J42 0810  4    ties of social solidarity. National identification
J42 0820  1    was not new, but it was accelerating in intensity and
J42 0820 11    scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred.
J42 0830  6    It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in
J42 0840  4    notions of "state will" put forward by the Germans,
J42 0850  3    especially by Hegel, although political philosophers
J42 0850  9    will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines
J42 0860  8    of Hobbes. National identification was reflected
J42 0870  4    jurisprudentially
J42 0870  5    in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction
J42 0880  5    and saw law, domestic and international, simply as
J42 0890  3    its formal reflection. In the international community
J42 0900  1    this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation. A state,
J42 0900 10    the highest form of human organization in fact and
J42 0910  9    theory, could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation
J42 0920  7    of self-will, or consent. According to the new theories,
J42 0930  5    the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was "sovereign"
J42 0940  3    in a quite new and different sense from his historical
J42 0950  1    predecessors. He no longer sought to find the law;
J42 0950 10    he made it; he could be subjected to law only because
J42 0960  9    he agreed to be. There was no law, domestic or international,
J42 0970  6    except that willed by, acknowledged by, or consented
J42 0980  4    to by states.
J42 0980  7       Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical
J42 0990  4    reasons for a changing jurisprudence. Related to, but
J42 1000  3    distinguishable from, nationalism was the growth of
J42 1000 10    democracy in one form or another. Increased participation
J42 1010  8    in politics and the demands of various groups for status
J42 1020  8    and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions.
J42 1030  5    The efforts of various interest groups to control or
J42 1040  4    influence governmental decisions, particularly when
J42 1050  1    taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization,
J42 1050  9    led to a concentration of attention on the legislative
J42 1060  6    power and the means whereby policy could be formulated
J42 1070  5    and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions.
J42 1080  1    Law became a conscious process, something more than
J42 1080  9    simply doing justice and looking to local customs and
J42 1090  9    a common morality for applicable norms. Particularly
J42 1100  4    was this true when the norms previously applied were
J42 1110  3    no longer satisfactory to many, when customs were rapidly
J42 1120  1    changing as the forces of the new productivity were
J42 1120 10    harnessed. The old way of doing things, which depended
J42 1130  8    on a relatively stable community with stable ideas
J42 1140  4    dealing with familiar situations, was no longer adequate
J42 1150  2    to the task. First was the period of codification of
J42 1150 12    existing law: the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar
J42 1160 10    codification that, in fact, resulted from Austin's
J42 1170  7    restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England.
J42 1180  6    Codification was followed in all countries by a growing
J42 1190  4    amount of legislation, some changing and adjusting
J42 1200  1    the older law, much dealing with entirely new situations.
J42 1200 10    The legislative mills have been grinding ever since,
J42 1210  7    and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate
J42 1220  5    to the task, a limited legislative authority was delegated
J42 1230  3    in one form or another, to the executive. Whereas the
J42 1240  2    eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought
J42 1240 12    justice, the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries
J42 1250  7    in which men are satisfied with law. Indeed, with developed
J42 1260  6    positivism, the separation of law from justice, or
J42 1270  4    from morality generally, became quite specific.
J42 1280  1       In municipal systems we tend to view what is called
J42 1280 11    positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize
J42 1290  6    policy by increasing the power of parliament- the elected
J42 1300  5    representatives- at the expense of the more conservative
J42 1310  3    judiciary. When the power of the latter was made both
J42 1320  2    limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and
J42 1320 10    made more precise and the creation of new norms was
J42 1330  8    placed exclusively in parliamentary hands- two purposes
J42 1340  3    were served: Government was made subservient to an
J42 1350  3    institutionalized popular will, and law became a rational
J42 1360  1    system for implementing that will, for serving conscious
J42 1360  9    goals, for embodying the "public policy". It is true
J42 1370  7    that, initially, the task was to remove restrictions
J42 1380  5    that, it was thought, inhibited the free flow of money,
J42 1390  4    goods, and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious
J42 1400  1    policy. Law was seen as an emanation of the "sovereign
J42 1400 11    will". However, the sovereign was not Hobbes' absolute
J42 1410  8    monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin.
J42 1420  6    It was, too, an optimistic philosophy, and, though
J42 1430  4    it separated law from morality, it was by no means
J42 1440  1    an immoral or amoral one. Man, through democratic institutions
J42 1450  1    of government and economic freedom, was master of his
J42 1450 10    destiny. The theory did not require, though it unfortunately
J42 1460  7    might acquire, a Hegelian mystique. It was merely a
J42 1470  6    rationalization and ordering of new institutions of
J42 1480  2    popular government. It was not opposed to either justice
J42 1490  1    or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective
J42 1490  9    views of officials who wielded public authority.
J42 1500  5       Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism
J42 1510  4    became the dominant credo of Western society. To free
J42 1520  3    the factors of production was a major objective of
J42 1520 12    the rising bourgeoisie, and this objective required
J42 1530  6    that governmental authority- administrative officials
J42 1540  5    and judges- be limited as precisely and explicitly
J42 1550  3    as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade
J42 1550 11    be abrogated; that business be free from governmental
J42 1560  8    supervision and notions of morality which might clog
J42 1570  7    the automatic adjustments of the free market; that
J42 1580  4    obligations of status that were inconsistent with the
J42 1590  2    new politics and the new economics be done away with.
J42 1590 12    Contract- conceived as the free bargain of formal equals-
J42 1600 11    replaced the implied obligations of a more static and
J42 1610  7    status-conscious society. Indeed, contract was the
J42 1620  4    dominant legal theme of the century, the touchstone
J42 1630  1    of the free society. Government itself was based upon
J42 1630 10    contract; business organization- the corporation- was
J42 1640  4    analyzed in contractual terms; trade was based on freedom
J42 1650  6    of contract, and money was lent and borrowed on contractual
J42 1660  4    terms; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual
J42 1670  4    arrangement. It is not surprising that the international
J42 1680  1    obligations of states were also viewed in terms of
J42 1680 10    contract. In fact, some- Anzilotti is the principle
J42 1690  7    example- went so far as to say that all international
J42 1700  6    law could be traced to the single legal norm, Pacta
J42 1710  3    sunt Servanda.
J42 1710  5       The displacement (at least to a considerable extent)
J42 1720  4    of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and
J42 1730  2    eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international
J42 1730  9    law theory and doctrine. In the first place the new
J42 1740 10    doctrine brought a formal separation of international
J42 1760  5    from municipal law, rejecting the earlier view that
J42 1770  3    both were parts of a universal legal system. One result
J42 1780  1    was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the
J42 1780 11    law of nations. Admiralty law, the law merchant, and
J42 1790  7    the host of problems which arise in private litigation
J42 1800  4    because of some contact with a foreign country were
J42 1810  2    all severed from the older Law of Nations and made
J42 1810 12    dependent on the several national laws. Private international
J42 1820  8    law (which Americans call the "conflict of laws") was
J42 1830  7    thus segregated from international law proper, or,
J42 1840  4    as it is often called, public international law. States
J42 1850  2    were free to enact, within broad though (perhaps) determinate
J42 1860  1    limits, their own rules as to the application of foreign
J42 1860 11    law by their courts, to vary the law merchant, and
J42 1870  8    to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising
J42 1880  5    on the high seas. The change was not quite so dramatic
J42 1890  3    as it sounds because in fact common norms continued
J42 1890 12    to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually
J42 1900  9    changed by legislation, and then largely in marginal
J42 1910  6    situations.
