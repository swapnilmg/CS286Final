H27 0010  1    Sales and net income for the year ended December 31,
H27 0010 11    1960 showed an improvement over 1959. Net income was
H27 0020  7    $2,557,111, or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares
H27 0030  5    currently outstanding, as compared to $2,323,867 or
H27 0040  2    $2.82 per share in 1959, adjusted to the same number
H27 0040 12    of shares.
H27 0050  1       Sales and other operating income increased 25.1%
H27 0050  8    from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960. This
H27 0060  8    increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net
H27 0070  6    income of higher costs of manufacture and increased
H27 0080  2    expenditures on research and development.
H27 0080  7       In spite of the fact that our largest market, the
H27 0090  9    textile industry, was affected substantially by the
H27 0100  4    current decline in business activity, we have been
H27 0110  2    able to produce and deliver our machines throughout
H27 0110 10    the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during
H27 0120  8    1959.
H27 0120  9    #OUTLOOK FOR CURRENT YEAR#
H27 0130  2    Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted
H27 0130 11    and unless this trend can be reversed, our production
H27 0140  9    for 1961 will be lower than for 1960.
H27 0150  4       However, the healthy inventory position of the textile
H27 0160  3    industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief
H27 0160 11    that improvement in that industry can be expected by
H27 0170  9    the second half of 1961.
H27 0180  1    #NEED FOR SOUND TAX POLICY#
H27 0180  6    In connection with our continuing development of new
H27 0190  4    and more efficient mill machinery, a sounder U. S.
H27 0200  2    income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment,
H27 0200 10    enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines
H27 0210 11    on a more realistic basis, could, if adopted, have
H27 0220  6    favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next
H27 0230  5    few years.
H27 0230  7       Such a depreciation policy would also, we believe,
H27 0240  4    prove a very important factor in strengthening the
H27 0250  1    competitive position of the U. S. textile and other
H27 0250 10    industries, thus helping to strengthen the position
H27 0260  7    of the dollar in foreign exchange.
H27 0270  1    #RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT#
H27 0270  4    Our research and development program, serving as it
H27 0280  4    does an industry which must compete against low-cost
H27 0290  1    production throughout the world, continues to have
H27 0290  8    primary emphasis at Leesona.
H27 0300  3       This program is based on the policy of designing
H27 0310  1    and building efficient machines which will help produce
H27 0310  9    better textile values- fabrics whose cost in relation
H27 0320  6    to quality, fashion and utility provide the consumer
H27 0330  4    with better textile products for the money.
H27 0340  1       Such policy involves continuing effort to improve
H27 0340  8    on existing mill equipment, in terms of efficiency
H27 0350  7    and versatility. But more important, we believe, it
H27 0360  4    must concentrate on the development of entirely new
H27 0370  2    concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom
H27 0370 11    winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning
H27 0380  7    machine.
H27 0380  8    #BUDGET INCREASED#
H27 0390  1    On this basis, our already substantial budget for research
H27 0390 10    and development has been further increased in recent
H27 0400  8    years in order to finance the continuing engineering
H27 0410  4    and design work essential to Leesona's future growth
H27 0420  3    in sales and earnings.
H27 0420  7       Much of this necessary increase in research and
H27 0430  5    development, though properly chargeable to current
H27 0440  2    expenses, is not reflected in earnings until projects
H27 0440 10    are completed and the new machines sold in quantity,
H27 0450  8    usually over a period of several years.
H27 0460  3    #STRETCH YARN MACHINES#
H27 0460  6    In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch
H27 0470  7    yarn machines. These machines produce the higher quality
H27 0480  4    stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured
H27 0490  1    fabrics. During the past year, great progress has been
H27 0490 10    made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and
H27 0500  9    textured fabrics. Fashion centers are now predicting
H27 0510  5    broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved "wash
H27 0520  3    and wear" dresses and blouses made from these fabrics.
H27 0530  1       This machine, operating at speeds up to 350,000
H27 0530  9    revolutions per minute, is believed to provide one
H27 0540  8    of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today.
H27 0550  4    It transfers yarn directly from the producers' largest
H27 0560  2    package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil
H27 0560 11    loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics.
H27 0570  7    #LARGE-PACKAGE TWISTER#
H27 0580  1    Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber
H27 0580 10    yarns is performing well in our customers' mills. Later
H27 0590  7    in the year, additional types of this Leesona twister
H27 0600  5    will be made available to mills for other man-made
H27 0610  3    fibers and natural yarns. These machines are designed
H27 0610 11    to provide higher operating speeds, larger yarn packages,
H27 0620  7    and greater flexibility of application to different
H27 0630  5    types of yarn. This we believe will substantially broaden
H27 0640  3    the potential market for the equipment.
H27 0640  9    #UNICONER#
H27 0650  1    Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the
H27 0650 10    scheduled completion of tooling for production of the
H27 0660  8    Uniconer automatic coning machine. This work is progressing
H27 0670  7    on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments
H27 0680  4    in the fourth quarter of this year. This machine was
H27 0690  2    demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last
H27 0690  9    year and was well received by the industry. The potential
H27 0700  9    market for the machine should be comparable to that
H27 0710  6    of the Unifil loom winder.
H27 0720  1       The Uniconer has several outstanding features- it
H27 0720  7    operates with much greater efficiency than existing
H27 0730  5    equipment; it incorporates an automatic knot-tying
H27 0740  3    device on each spindle, and it will knot a break in
H27 0750  1    the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins
H27 0750 13    as the running end is exhausted.
H27 0760  3       Because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a relatively
H27 0770  2    high-cost operation for the mill, the almost complete
H27 0770 11    automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important
H27 0780  8    economies in textile production, at the same time upgrading
H27 0790  7    quality. Many mills have already placed firm orders
H27 0800  4    for this machine.
H27 0800  7    #NEW UNIFIL APPLICATION#
H27 0810  1    A new application for the Unifil loom winder, running
H27 0810 10    single filling for box looms, will broaden mill use
H27 0820  8    of this equipment.
H27 0820 11    #TAKE-UP MACHINES#
H27 0830  2    A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to
H27 0830 12    facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production
H27 0840 11    of thermoplastic yarns. It is equipped with electronic
H27 0850  7    controls that can be set to hold precise tension and
H27 0860  5    speed.
H27 0860  6       This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret
H27 0870  4    or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to
H27 0880  3    6,000 feet per minute. It is equipped with an automatic
H27 0880 13    threading device to reduce waste and handling time.
H27 0890  8       Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are
H27 0900  6    undergoing important pilot plant testing for application
H27 0910  3    with new high polymer yarns, in several fiber producing
H27 0920  1    plants. We look forward to a stronger position in this
H27 0920 11    expanding field.
H27 0930  2    #DIVERSIFICATION PLANS#
H27 0930  4    We are interested in further diversification into other
H27 0940  3    fields of capital goods, or components for industrial
H27 0950  1    products, and have recently intensified our efforts
H27 0950  8    in that direction.
H27 0960  1    #PATTERSON MOOS RESEARCH#
H27 0960  4    Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further
H27 0970  5    very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells.
H27 0980  3    The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee,
H27 0980 10    Pratt + Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft
H27 0990  8    Corporation, has been important in this work. In addition
H27 1010  9    to its major effort on fuel cells, Patterson Moos Research
H27 1020  5    Division is continuing to carry on research in other
H27 1030  5    fields, both under contract for the Defense Department,
H27 1040  1    other government agencies and for our own account.
H27 1040  9    PMR is currently supplying components vital to the
H27 1050  8    Titan and Minuteman programs.
H27 1060  2       We have recently entered into an agreement with
H27 1060 10    Compagnie Generale de Telegraphie Sans Fil (CSF) of
H27 1070  8    France for the exclusive exchange of technical information
H27 1080  7    on thermoelectric materials. The agreement gives us
H27 1090  5    rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials
H27 1100  4    in the United States. Initially we will import the
H27 1110  1    thermoelectric materials and modules from France but
H27 1110  8    later we will manufacture in this country. There is
H27 1120  7    a rapidly growing demand for this material, primarily
H27 1130  3    from the military. Further research, we believe, will
H27 1140  2    develop important commercial applications.
H27 1140  6       A project for the Air Force has been completed in
H27 1150  8    which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed
H27 1160  5    for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases.
H27 1170  2       We are initiating research on the use of solid state
H27 1180  1    materials for infrared detection using a method which
H27 1180  9    will not require cooling of materials to attain high
H27 1190  7    sensitivity.
H27 1190  8       The rapid advance in science today suggests many
H27 1200  7    other avenues of investigation. Our plan is to keep
H27 1210  6    abreast of these advances, and select for development
H27 1220  1    those fields which seem most promising for our special
H27 1220 10    capabilities.
H27 1230  1    #NEW PLANT FACILITIES#
H27 1230  4    Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000
H27 1240  5    plant in Warwick, Rhode Island, which will house our
H27 1250  2    textile and coil winding machinery operations. Construction
H27 1250  9    is well along, and the plant is scheduled for completion
H27 1260 10    in November of this year. All operations now carried
H27 1270  7    on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to
H27 1280  4    Warwick. Operations in the new plant should be producing
H27 1290  2    efficiently early in 1962.
H27 1290  6       An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown
H27 1300  7    on the front cover. The building will contain 430,000
H27 1310  2    square feet, approximately the same as our present
H27 1310 10    plant. However, its modern one-story layout is designed
H27 1320  8    to increase our production capacity, permit more efficient
H27 1330  5    manufacturing, and substantially reduce current repair
H27 1340  4    and maintenance costs.
H27 1340  7       A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick
H27 1350  7    site, four miles from Cranston, was the fact that it
H27 1360  5    permits retention of our present trained and highly
H27 1370  1    skilled work force.
H27 1370  4       We have entered into an agreement for the sale of
H27 1380  3    the present Cranston properties, effective as soon
H27 1380 10    as we have completed removal to our new plant.
H27 1390  7    #BRITISH SUBSIDIARY#
H27 1390  9    During the year our British subsidiary, Leesona-Holt,
H27 1400  8    Limited, expanded its plant in Darwen, England, and
H27 1410  7    added machine tool capacity. The operations of its
H27 1420  4    other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations
H27 1430  1    in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired
H27 1430  9    plant in the adjoining town of Heywood. Layout and
H27 1440  9    equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased
H27 1450  6    production on an efficient basis. The area available
H27 1460  4    at Heywood is approximately three times the size of
H27 1470  2    the former Rochdale and Manchester locations. In addition,
H27 1470 10    land has been purchased to permit doubling the size
H27 1480  9    of the plant in the future.
H27 1490  1    #FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS#
H27 1490  3    The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense
H27 1500  4    and under our direction. It will be transfered on completion
H27 1510  2    to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island, a non-profit
H27 1520  1    organization, which will reimburse us for the cost
H27 1520  9    of construction. we will then occupy the new plant
H27 1530  8    under lease, with an option to purchase. These arrangements
H27 1540  3    are, in our opinion, very favorable to Leesona. Interim
H27 1550  2    financing of construction costs is provided by a short
H27 1560  1    term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank.
H27 1560  8       In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant,
H27 1570  5    we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery
H27 1580  3    and equipment at Cranston, and for new machinery, plant
H27 1590  2    and equipment at Leesona-Holt, Limited. We believe
H27 1590 10    that these improved facilities will contribute income
H27 1600  6    and effect savings which will fully justify the investment.
H27 1610  6       Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to
H27 1620  5    $2,461,000. Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514
H27 1630  2    during the year and should decline in coming months.
H27 1630 11    Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position.
H27 1640  9    #EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS#
H27 1650  1    In accordance with the two-year contract signed in
H27 1650 10    May, 1959, with the International Association of Machinists,
H27 1660  6    AFL-CIO, wages of hourly employees were increased
H27 1670  6    by 4% in May, 1960, and pay levels for non-exempt salaried
H27 1680  5    employees were increased proportionately. In addition,
H27 1690  3    Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents
H27 1700  1    was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private
H27 1700 11    hospital accommodations.
H27 1710  2    #PERSONNEL BENEFITS#
H27 1710  4    In addition to direct salaries and wages, the Company
H27 1720  5    paid or accrued during the year the following amounts
H27 1730  2    for the benefit of employees: @
H27 1730  8       During the pension year ended December 31, 1960,
H27 1740  6    23 employees retired, making a total of 171 currently
H27 1750  4    retired under the Company's pension plan. At December
H27 1760  2    13, 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank
H27 1760 12    of Providence, as trustee for payment of past and future
H27 1770 10    service pensions to qualified members of the plan,
H27 1780  7    totaled $2,412,616.
H27 1790  1       The basic market for textiles is growing with the
H27 1790 10    expansion of the population that began 20 years ago.
H27 1800  8    Another growth factor is increased consumer demand
H27 1810  3    for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics
H27 1820  1    that go with a rising standard of living.
H27 1820  9       As in many other industries, rising costs and intense
H27 1830  6    competition, both domestic and foreign, have exerted
H27 1840  4    increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry
H27 1850  1    in recent years.
H27 1850  4    #INCREASED EFFICIENCY#
H27 1850  6    In textiles, as elsewhere, a major part of the solution
H27 1860  7    lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity.
H27 1870  3       As a designer and manufacturer of textile production
H27 1880  2    machinery, Leesona and other companies in its industry
H27 1880 10    have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved
H27 1890 10    equipment and methods that would increase production,
H27 1900  5    yet maintain both quality and flexibility.
H27 1910  1    #PROBLEMS OF SHIFTING STYLES#
H27 1910  5    The problem of efficient production in textiles is
H27 1920  5    complicated by the fact that the industry serves large
H27 1930  2    markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion
H27 1930 10    in apparel or home decoration. Production must be adjusted
H27 1940  8    accordingly, at minimum cost and quickly.
H27 1950  5       In addition, production machinery must in many cases
H27 1960  4    be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural
H27 1970  1    fibers and the increasing number of synthetics, as
H27 1970  9    well as blends.
