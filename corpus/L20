L20 0010  1       HARBOR POINT sticks out into the ocean like the
L20 0010 10    fat neck of a steamer clam. It's a rich village but
L20 0020 10    not much for action- too many solid residents, not
L20 0030  5    enough tourists or working stiffs. It's at the far
L20 0040  4    end of the county and the last time I came here was
L20 0040 16    for a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months
L20 0050  9    ago.
L20 0050 10       Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self; a man
L20 0060  9    mountain running to lard in his middle-age. Seeing
L20 0070  6    me he said with real surprise, "Well, well, ain't we
L20 0080  3    honored! Hardly expected the head of County Homicide
L20 0090  1    up for this murder. You sure climbed fast, Jed. Rookie
L20 0090 11    investigator last summer and now it's Inspector Jed.
L20 0100  8    Took me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police
L20 0110  9    force. Proves a college education pays off". His sarcasm
L20 0120  6    was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and
L20 0130  4    bad teeth.
L20 0130  6       "I guess it helps", I said, paying no attention
L20 0140  4    to his ribbing.
L20 0140  7       "Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be
L20 0150  7    a cop, Jed. You're not only young but ... well, you
L20 0160  3    don't even look like a police officer. A runt with
L20 0170  1    narrow shoulders and that brush haircut ... hell, you'd
L20 0170 10    pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set. In
L20 0180  8    my day the first requirement for a cop was to look
L20 0190  7    like the law, big and tough. Man, when my 275 pounds
L20 0200  2    and six-four comes along, why it's the same as another
L20 0200 13    badge. When I say move, a guy moves"!
L20 0210  8       "Don't worry about my being tough, Moore. Also,
L20 0220  6    it's far too early in the day for corny lines like
L20 0230  3    the bigger they come ... You've had your gassy lecture,
L20 0240  1    let's get to work. Who was the murdered woman ... Mrs.
L20 0240 12    Buck"?
L20 0250  1       "Widow, nice sort of woman. Comfortably fixed. Ran
L20 0250  9    a fair-sized farm. Came to the Harbor as a bride and
L20 0260 12    ... Don't worry Jed, this one is in the bag. I know
L20 0270 10    the killer, have the only road off the peninsula covered".
L20 0280  5       "Yeah, passed your road block as I drove in", I
L20 0290  6    said, sitting on his polished desk. Although Bob dressed
L20 0300  3    like a slob, he kept a neat office. "Okay, what happened"?
L20 0310  1       "About nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones me she's
L20 0320  1    having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble.
L20 0320 11    Colored fellow named Tim Williams- only hand she has
L20 0330  9    working for her now. Tim come with the migratory workers
L20 0340  8    that follow the crops up from the South last year,
L20 0350  5    but Tim and his wife settled here. Never had no trouble
L20 0360  3    with him before, thought he was a hard worker, hustling
L20 0360 13    around to get a full week's work. Anyway, Julia asks
L20 0370 10    me to ...".
L20 0380  1       "Julia"?
L20 0380  2       "Come on, Inspector, look alive. Julia Buck, the
L20 0390  4    deceased", Moore said, slipping me his smug, idiot-grin
L20 0400  1    again. "Julia asks me to come out at once. But she
L20 0400 12    didn't sound real alarmed ... you know, like there
L20 0410  9    was any immediate danger. I got there at 9:47 A.M.,
L20 0420  7    found her strangled. I would have come sooner if I'd
L20 0430  5    known ... No doubt about Tim being the killer- I have
L20 0440  5    a witness. Don't know why the County had to send anybody
L20 0450  1    up here. Told them I can handle this".
L20 0450  9       "Yeah, seems you have a nice package, with all the
L20 0460  9    strings tied. Who's ..."?
L20 0470  1       "I'll collar Tim before night".
L20 0470  6       "Who's your witness"?
L20 0480  2       "Julia had- has- an old Indian woman cooking for
L20 0490  2    her- Nellie Harris. Probably the last of the original
L20 0490 11    Island Indians. Nellie was in the kitchen, had just
L20 0500  9    come to work, when she heard Tim arguing with Julia
L20 0510  7    in the living room. Swears she recognized his voice,
L20 0520  4    that Tim yelled, 'It's my money and I want it'! and
L20 0530  3    then rushed out of the house. Then she heard Julia
L20 0530 13    phone me. Nellie went on with her house work- until
L20 0540 10    I found Julia dead. And before you say it, Nellie ain't
L20 0550  8    near strong enough to have strangled Julia. There's
L20 0560  4    no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck.
L20 0570  3    Another fact: Tim's disappeared- on the run. But there's
L20 0580  3    no way off the Point except through my road block.
L20 0580 13    Guess you want to see the body- have her up the street
L20 0590 12    in Doc Abel's office". "Let's see it".
L20 0600  5       We walked up Main Street to this big white house,
L20 0610  6    then around to the back. Being the Harbors sole doctor,
L20 0620  3    Abel was also its Medical Examiner. The corpse was
L20 0630  1    on a table, covered by a sheet. Doc Abel was busy up
L20 0630 13    front with some of his live patients. Pulling back
L20 0640  7    the sheet, I examined the bruises around Julia Buck's
L20 0650  4    once slender throat. Powerful hands had killed her.
L20 0660  2    "Find any prints"?
L20 0660  5       Chief Moore shook his big head, seemed lost in thought
L20 0670  6    as he stared at the nude body. Then he said, "Never
L20 0680  3    noticed it before ... I mean, when she was dressed
L20 0680 13    ... but for a woman her age, Julia had a real fine
L20 0690 12    figure".
L20 0700  1       I dropped the sheet, glanced at my watch. It was
L20 0700 10    almost one and I hadn't had lunch. Still, I wanted
L20 0710  6    to get this over with, had a lot of paper work waiting
L20 0720  4    in my own office. I told him, "I want to go see the
L20 0730  2    Buck house".
L20 0730  4       "Sure".
L20 0730  5       Walking back down Main Street, I said, "I saw the
L20 0740  7    Harbor's one squad car at the road block, we'll ride
L20 0750  5    out in my car".
L20 0750  9       "Naw, we'll use mine", Moore said, opening the door
L20 0760  7    of a sleek white Jaguar roadster. As I slid in beside
L20 0770  6    him he said, "Some heap, hey? Got a heck of a buy on
L20 0780  5    this, dirt cheap".
L20 0780  8       "Yeah, it's a real load", I told him, looking up
L20 0790  6    the street at my battered Ford.
L20 0800  1       Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway
L20 0800  9    of this typical two-story house, and when the Jaguar
L20 0810  8    stopped I managed to swallow. There was a garage and
L20 0820  6    a modern barn in the rear, all of it standing between
L20 0830  2    two large flat fields planted in early potatoes. Everything
L20 0840  1    shouted gentleman farming, the kind of grandfather-father-to
L20 0840 10    son folding money the Point is known for. The fins
L20 0850  9    of a Caddy were sticking out of the garage, while the
L20 0860  7    inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old
L20 0870  3    and expensive contemporary furniture.
L20 0870  7       Nellie Harris wasn't old, she was ancient- a tiny
L20 0880  8    shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune. She was
L20 0890  7    also stone deaf in her right ear. She calmly repeated
L20 0900  2    what Moore had told me. When I asked, "Why didn't you
L20 0910  2    go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was"?
L20 0910 13    the old gal stared at me with her hard eyes, said,
L20 0920 10    "She didn't call. I do the living room last. I went
L20 0930  8    up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom- way I always
L20 0940  4    do in the morning".
L20 0940  8       "Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were
L20 0950  9    arguing about"?
L20 0960  1       "Probably wages. Miss Julia was a hard woman with
L20 0960  9    a dollar. Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social
L20 0970 11    Security, so's I wouldn't have to be working now, Miss
L20 0980  7    Julia threatened to fire me- all because it would mean
L20 0990  6    a few more dollars a year to her".
L20 1000  1       "Did you hear Tim return"?
L20 1000  6       "No sir. Nobody came until Chief Moore".
L20 1010  3       I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil. "Mrs.
L20 1020  2    Buck have any men friends"?
L20 1020  7       "Her"? The wrinkled mouth laughed, revealing astonishingly
L20 1030  7    strong, white, teeth. "I never see none. But then I
L20 1040  8    wasn't her social secretary".
L20 1050  1       "Was she on friendly terms with other members of
L20 1050 10    her family"?
L20 1060  1       "Didn't have no family- around here. They had a
L20 1070  2    son- killed in the war".
L20 1070  7       I walked into the living room. There didn't seem
L20 1080  5    to be any signs of a struggle. I told Moore, "Where
L20 1090  2    does Tim's wife live"?
L20 1090  6       "I'll take you there. Look Jed, this is an open
L20 1100  8    and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road
L20 1110  6    block soon. Okay, come on".
L20 1110 11       We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road
L20 1120  9    to a cluster of shacks. In late summer migratory workers
L20 1130  4    lived five and six to a room in these. Now they were
L20 1140  3    empty, except for a cottage across the road.
L20 1140 11       Mrs. Tim Williams was about 21, with skin the color
L20 1150 10    of bitter chocolate, and if you discounted the plain
L20 1160  7    dress and worn slippers, she was startlingly pretty.
L20 1170  2    The inside of their place was full of new furniture,
L20 1170 12    five bucks down and a buck a week stuff, but all of
L20 1180 12    it clean and full of the warmth of a home.
L20 1190  6       Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened. She
L20 1200  2    said she didn't know a thing- Tim had left the house
L20 1210  1    at six in the morning, as usual. She hadn't seen him
L20 1210 12    since.
L20 1220  1       "Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages"? I asked.
L20 1220 10       "Well, for this week, but they wasn't due 'till
L20 1230  9    Saturday. Listen, Mr. Inspector, no matter what anybody
L20 1240  7    say, my Tim didn't kill that woman! Tim is a good man,
L20 1250  6    hard working. He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby.
L20 1260  5    Even if he angry, Tim wouldn't hurt a woman. He never
L20 1270  2    in his life took a hand to a woman or ..."
L20 1270 13       "We'll get him soon, see what he says", Chief Moore
L20 1280 10    cut in.
L20 1290  1       "Does your husband have a car"? I asked.
L20 1290  8       "Got us an old station wagon. Need it for the job".
L20 1300  8       I asked a silly question: "You've no idea where
L20 1310  5    your husband could be, now"?
L20 1320  1       She shook her head. I knew she was lying. I stood
L20 1320 12    there, staring at her for a moment- thinking mostly
L20 1330  8    of her beauty and her poverty.
L20 1340  1       Moore said, "Come on, Jed, I have to get to my men".
L20 1350  1       On my way out I told her, "If you should ... eh
L20 1350 13    ... just happen to see your husband, get him to give
L20 1360 10    himself up. He'll get a fair trial. Hiding out like
L20 1370  6    this won't get him anything, except more trouble, or
L20 1380  3    a bullet".
L20 1380  5       "Yes. I'll tell him- if I see him".
L20 1390  4       We made it back to the Harbor in less than four
L20 1400  1    minutes. I tried not to act scared. That Jaguar could
L20 1400 11    really barrel along. I told Moore I was going to eat,
L20 1410 10    get some forms filled out by Doc Abel.
L20 1420  4       Chief Moore said, "If I don't see you when I return,
L20 1430  4    see you for certain at my road block, Inspector".
L20 1440  1       I had a bowl of decent chowder, phoned the Doc and
L20 1440 12    he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl-
L20 1450  8    in a half hour. Lighting my pipe, I took a walk. The
L20 1460  8    Harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer. Even
L20 1470  4    now, there were several slick cruisers tied to the
L20 1470 13    dock, an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater.
L20 1480  9    There was a 34 foot Wheeler with CHIEF BOB'S in big
L20 1490  9    gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock.
L20 1500  7    It wasn't a new boat, about five years old, but fitted
L20 1510  4    with fishing outriggers and chairs. I asked an old
L20 1520  1    guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's.
L20 1520 11    He said, "You bet. Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue
L20 1530  9    fishing".
L20 1540  1       I dropped into the doctor's office, picked up my
L20 1540  9    forms. As I was walking back to the Police Station,
L20 1550  6    which was in the same building with the City Hall and
L20 1560  5    Post Office, I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into
L20 1570  2    the back of my car. If she moved gracefully, she was
L20 1570 13    clumsy at it.
L20 1580  3       I got into the front seat. She was 'hiding' on the
L20 1590  2    floor of the back seat, the soft curves of her back
L20 1590 13    and hips- rousing lines. I drove out of the Harbor,
L20 1600  8    turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees
L20 1610  6    and stopped. I waited a few minutes and she sat up.
L20 1620  3    For another moment we didn't talk, then she began to
L20 1620 13    weep. She mumbled, "I just know that Chief Moore is
L20 1630 10    out to kill my Tim"!
L20 1640  1       "Maybe. I never saw him so anxious before", I said,
L20 1650  2    lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette. "Of
L20 1650 11    course, it could be because this is his first murder
L20 1660  9    case. You know where Tim is, don't you, Mrs. Williams"?
L20 1670  6       She puffed on the cigarette slowly, sitting slumped
L20 1680  4    against the back seat; didn't answer.
