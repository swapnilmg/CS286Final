L08 0010  1       "Well"- said Mr. Skyros. "I take a little time to
L08 0020  1    think it over". It was awkward: very awkward. There
L08 0020 10    would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else
L08 0030  7    to take over. Someone reasonably trustworthy. And Angie
L08 0040  4    would hear about it. And Angie knew-
L08 0050  3       "Time", said Angie, and he smiled very sweet and
L08 0050 12    slow at Mr. Skyros. "Not too much time, because I'll
L08 0060  9    be needing some more myself pretty much right away.
L08 0070  7    And I done favors for you, big favor not so long back,
L08 0080  6    didn't I, and I'm right here to take on where Pretty
L08 0090  3    left off. No trouble. I don't want no trouble, you
L08 0100  1    don't want no trouble, nobody wants trouble, Mr. Skyros".
L08 0110  1       Dear heaven, no, thought Mr. Skyros, turning away
L08 0110  9    as another man came in. He straightened his tie at
L08 0120  9    the mirror with a shaking hand; the genial smile seemed
L08 0130  5    painted on his face. Angie knew- Speak of dangerous
L08 0140  3    information! Angie knew too much entirely already.
L08 0140 10    Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay ...
L08 0150  8       "Big favor I done you. Acourse there's this deal
L08 0160  6    o' Denny's- and Jackie's- kinda hangin' fire, ain't
L08 0170  7    it, maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that. And
L08 0180  4    can't say I blame you", said Angie thoughtfully. "This
L08 0190  2    deal with the ace o' spades. Anything to do with an
L08 0190 13    ace o' spades, bad luck".
L08 0200  5       Ace of spades- a widow, that was what they called
L08 0210  4    a widow, these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros
L08 0220  1    distractedly. All about that Angie knew, too. When
L08 0220  9    things got a little out of hand, they very rapidly
L08 0230  9    got a lot out of hand- it seemed to be a general rule.
L08 0240  6    All just by chance, and in a way tracing back to poor
L08 0250  4    Frank, all of it, because naturally- brothers, living
L08 0260  1    together- and Angie-
L08 0260  3       Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's
L08 0270  4    regular-featured, almost girlishly good-looking face-
L08 0290  3    or indeed anything about Angelo. Mr. Skyros was not
L08 0290 12    a man who thought very much about moral principles;
L08 0300  8    he found money much more interesting; but all the same
L08 0310  6    he thought now, uneasily, of the way in which Angelo
L08 0320  4    earned his living- and paid for his own stuff- and
L08 0330  2    eyed the soft smile, and the spaniel-like dark eyes,
L08 0330 12    and he felt a little ill.
L08 0340  3       "Look, my friend", he said, "in my life I learn,
L08 0350  2    how is it the proverb says, better an ounce of prevention
L08 0350 13    to a pound of cure. I stay in business so long because
L08 0360 11    I'm careful. Two weeks, a month, we talk it over again,
L08 0370  9    and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops
L08 0380  6    know this and that, then we make a little deal, isn't
L08 0390  2    it"?
L08 0390  3       "That's a long while", said Angie. "I tell you,
L08 0400  4    you want to leave it that way, I don't fool around
L08 0410  1    with it. I go over to Castro and get fixed up there.
L08 0410 13    I can't wait no two weeks".
L08 0420  4       And Mr. Skyros didn't like Angie, but what with
L08 0430  3    Prettyman and three of his boys inside, and not likely
L08 0440  1    to come out- And Angie such a valuable salesman, Prettyman
L08 0440 11    said- All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch
L08 0450 12    with practically a whole new bunch of boys- Why did
L08 0460  8    everything have to happen at once?
L08 0470  1       Denny said stupidly, "Why, you ain't turning Angie
L08 0470  9    down, are you, Mr. Skyros? I mean, we all figured-
L08 0480 10    I guess anybody'd figure- Angie"-
L08 0490  1       Angelo gave him an affectionate smile. "Mr. Skyros
L08 0510  4    too smart a fellow want to get rid of me", he said.
L08 0520  3    "It's O.K., Denny, everything's O.K. Ain't it, Mr.
L08 0530  3    Skyros"?
L08 0530  4       Oh, God, the name repeated over and over, anybody
L08 0540  4    to hear- Not being a fool, Mr. Skyros knew why. But
L08 0550  3    aside from everything else, it would scarcely be pleasant
L08 0560  1    to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling
L08 0560 11    and actually held- you could say- the whip hand. And
L08 0570  8    all because of Domokous! If Mr. Skyros had dreamed
L08 0580  6    of all the trouble that young man would eventually
L08 0590  2    cause-
L08 0590  3       Of course, there was another factor. Angie worth
L08 0600  2    his weight in gold right now, but these users, they
L08 0600 12    sometimes went down fast. Who knew, Angie might not
L08 0610  9    last long ... The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros' forehead
L08 0620  9    as he realized he had been actually thinking- hoping-
L08 0630  5    planning- perhaps-
L08 0640  1       Good God above, had not Domokous been enough?
L08 0640  8       He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally. "Now
L08 0650  5    you don't want to go talking that way", he said. "Sure,
L08 0660  6    sure, you're the one take over for Pretty, soon as
L08 0670  5    I get the supply, get started up again, isn't it? You
L08 0680  3    don't need worry, Angelo. I tell you, I know how it
L08 0680 14    is with you, my friend, I sympathize, and I'll make
L08 0690 10    it a special point- a special favor- get in touch,
L08 0700  9    and get some stuff just for you. I don't know if I
L08 0710  6    can manage it tonight or tomorrow, but I'll try my
L08 0720  2    best, my friend. You see, you got to remember, we all
L08 0720 13    got schedules, like any business! My man, he won't
L08 0730  8    be around a little while, he just fixed me up with
L08 0740  7    this stuff they took out of the Elite. It's awkward,
L08 0750  2    you see that, isn't it"?
L08 0750  7       "Well, that's your business, Mr. Skyros", said Angie,
L08 0760  7    and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder
L08 0770  6    to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window. "I appreciate
L08 0780  4    it, you do that. Sure. We don't none of us want no
L08 0790  5    trouble ... I'm in a room over the Golden Club on
L08 0800  1    San Pedro, you just ask for me there, you want see
L08 0800 12    me. Or maybe I call you- tonight? About nine o'clock,
L08 0810  7    I call and see if you got any. A couple decks for me,
L08 0820  8    Mr. Skyros- and ten-twelve to sell, see, I like to
L08 0830  5    have a little ready cash".
L08 0830 10       "Oh, now, I don't know about that much", said Mr.
L08 0840  9    Skyros. "And you know, Angelo, Pretty, he always keeps
L08 0850  6    it a strict cash basis, like they say"-
L08 0860  1       "Sure", said Angie. "Sure, Mr. Skyros. Fifty a throw,
L08 0870  4    that the deal? Sure. I bring you the cash, say five
L08 0880  1    hundred for ten decks. Never mind how much I cut it,
L08 0880 12    how much I get", and he smiled his sleepy smile again.
L08 0890  9    "Standard deal, Mr. Skyros. You go 'n' have a look
L08 0900  8    round for it".
L08 0900 11       "I do my best", said Mr. Skyros earnestly, "just
L08 0910  9    for you, my friend. This is awkward for everybody,
L08 0920  6    isn't it, we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes.
L08 0930  3    But I do my best for you". He got out of there in a
L08 0940  5    hurry, brushing past another man in the door, mopping
L08 0950  1    his brow.
L08 0950  3       The expedient thing- yes, very true, one must make
L08 0960  1    do as one could, in some situations. It could all be
L08 0960 12    straightened out later. Not very much later, but when
L08 0970  8    things had settled down a little. After this deal with
L08 0980  5    the Bouvardier woman went through. An ace of spades
L08 0990  3    ... He was not a superstitious man, but he felt perhaps
L08 1000  1    there was a little something in that, indeed. He rather
L08 1000 11    wished he had never got into the business, and still-
L08 1010  9    scarcely to be resisted, a nice little profit with
L08 1020  6    not much work involved, easy money ...
L08 1030  1    ##
L08 1030  2    Katya Roslev, who would be Katharine Ross so very soon
L08 1030 12    now, rang up her first sale of the day and counted
L08 1040 11    back the change. She did not notice that the customer
L08 1050  7    seized her purchase and turned away without a smile
L08 1060  3    or a word of thanks. Usually she marked the few who
L08 1060 14    did thank you, you didn't get that kind much in a place
L08 1070 12    like this: and she played a little game with herself,
L08 1080  8    seeing how downright rude she could act to the others,
L08 1090  6    before they'd take offense, threaten to call the manager.
L08 1100  3    Funny how seldom they did: used to it, probably. The
L08 1110  1    kind who came into a cheap store like this! Grab, snatch,
L08 1110 12    I saw that first! and, Here, I'll take this, I was
L08 1120 10    before her, you wait on me now or I don't bother with
L08 1130 11    it, see! This kind of place ...
L08 1140  3       She'd be through here, just no time at all- leave
L08 1150  1    this kind of thing 'way behind. Off at noon, and she'd
L08 1150 12    never come back. Never have to. Money- a lot of money,
L08 1160 10    enough. She'd be smart about it, get him to give it
L08 1170 10    to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect- maybe
L08 1180  5    couldn't get it until Monday account of that, the banks-
L08 1190  5    But that wasn't really long to wait. Not when she'd
L08 1200  2    waited so long already.
L08 1200  6       No need say anything at all to the old woman. She
L08 1210  6    had it all planned out, how she'd do. She'd say she
L08 1220  3    didn't feel good on Sunday, couldn't go to church-
L08 1220 12    there'd be a little argument, but she could be stubborn-
L08 1230 10    and when the old woman had gone, quick pack the things
L08 1240  9    she'd need to take, all but the dress she'd wear Monday,
L08 1250  7    and take the bag down to that place in the station
L08 1260  4    where you could put things in a locker overnight, for
L08 1270  1    a dime. Then on Monday morning- or it might have to
L08 1270 12    be Tuesday- get up and leave just the usual time, and
L08 1280 12    last thing, put the money in an envelope under the
L08 1290  6    old woman's purse there in the drawer. She wouldn't
L08 1300  2    be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya
L08 1300 14    had left, go do the daily shopping. No need leave a
L08 1310 10    note with it, either- or maybe just something like,
L08 1320  6    Don't worry about me, I'm going away to make a better
L08 1330  5    life.
L08 1330  6       A better life. Escape. It wasn't as if she wanted
L08 1340  5    much. She didn't mind working hard, not as if she figured
L08 1350  3    to do anything wrong to live easy and soft- all she
L08 1360  1    wanted was a chance, where she wasn't marked as what
L08 1360 11    she was. To be Katharine Ross, and work in a nicer
L08 1380  9    shop somewhere, at a little more money so she could
L08 1390  6    have prettier clothes, and learn ladies' manners and
L08 1400  2    all like that, and get to know different people than
L08 1400 12    up to now, not just the ones like her here, with foreign-sounding
L08 1410 11    names, the ones went to the same church and- Different
L08 1420  9    place, different job, different people, she'd be all
L08 1430  5    different too. Prettier, she'd do her hair another
L08 1440  3    way; smarter, and wear different kinds of clothes-
L08 1450  1    she'd be Katharine Ross, just what that sounded like.
L08 1460  1       "You've give me the wrong change", said the customer
L08 1460 10    sharply. "Think I can't count"?
L08 1470  4       Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence.
L08 1480  2    She was listening to other voices, out of the future.
L08 1490  1    Some of those vaguely-imagined new, different people.
L08 1490  9    Oh, Katharine's awfully nice, and pretty too, I like
L08 1500  8    Katharine- Let's ask Katharine to go with us, she's
L08 1510  8    always lots of fun- Katharine-
L08 1520  3       Soon, very soon now ...
L08 1520  8    #@ SIXTEEN @#
L08 1520 11    Mendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty. It was
L08 1530  8    going to be another hot day; already the thermometer
L08 1540  5    stood close to ninety. Alison was still sound asleep;
L08 1550  3    he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk
L08 1560  1    drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her
L08 1560  9    handbag, and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its
L08 1570  7    bottom, which tasted peculiarly of face powder. He
L08 1580  5    left a note propped on the desk asking her to call
L08 1590  1    him sometime today, and drove home.
L08 1590  7       After he'd got out fresh liver for Bast, he paused
L08 1600  6    to look at her crouched daintily over her dish. Surely
L08 1610  3    she was just a trifle fatter around the middle? He
L08 1620  1    seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians
L08 1620  8    had large litters, and suffered a dismaying vision
L08 1630  6    of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens. "@Y
L08 1640  4    que sigue despues?- what then"? he asked her severely.
L08 1650  4    "A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like
L08 1660  2    cats, it's not the easiest thing in the world to find
L08 1660 13    good homes for kittens- and, damn it, you know very
L08 1670 10    well if I have them around long, impossible to give
L08 1680  6    them away! And I suppose now that you've finally grown
L08 1690  4    up, if a little late, you'd go on producing kittens
L08 1700  2    every six months or so. Yes, well, it's a pity to spoil
L08 1700 14    your girlish figure- which all those kittens would
L08 1710  8    do anyway- but I think when you've raised these we'll
L08 1720  7    just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more
L08 1730  6    ... I wonder if the Carters would take one ... And
L08 1740  3    it's no good looking at me like that", as she wound
L08 1740 14    affectionately around his ankles.
