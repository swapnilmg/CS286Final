K20 0010  1       She concluded by asking him to name another hour
K20 0010 10    should this one be inconvenient.
K20 0020  3       The fish took the bait. He replied that he could
K20 0030  2    not imagine what importance there might be in thus
K20 0030 11    meeting with a stranger, but- joy of joys, he would
K20 0040  9    be at home at the hour mentioned.
K20 0050  1       But when she called he had thought better of the
K20 0050 11    matter and decided not to involve himself in a new
K20 0060 10    entanglement. She was told by the manservant who opened
K20 0070  6    the door that his lordship was engaged on work from
K20 0080  4    which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed.
K20 0090  1    Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not
K20 0090  8    to let the rebuff daunt her purpose. She wrote again
K20 0100  7    and now, abandoning for the moment the theme of love,
K20 0110  5    she asked for help in the matter of her career. She
K20 0120  2    could act and she could write. His lordship was concerned
K20 0120 12    in the management of Drury Lane but, if there were
K20 0130  9    no opportunities there, would he read and criticize
K20 0140  6    her novel?
K20 0140  8       At last he consented to meet her, and following
K20 0150  6    that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable
K20 0160  4    proposal:
K20 0160  5       Have you any objection to the following plan? On
K20 0170  4    Thursday evening we may go out of town together by
K20 0180  2    some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve
K20 0180 13    miles. There we shall be free and unknown; we can return
K20 0190 10    the following morning ...
K20 0200  2       She concluded by asking for a brief interview- "to
K20 0200 11    settle with you where"- and she threw in a tribute
K20 0210 10    to his "gentle manners" and "the wild originality of
K20 0220  7    your countenance".
K20 0230  1       She opened his reply with trembling fingers ...
K20 0230  9    he agreed! And he would see her that evening. Victory
K20 0240  8    at last!
K20 0240 10       At their meeting he told her not to bother about
K20 0250  9    "where"- he would attend to that. There was one of
K20 0260  7    the new forte-pianos in the room and, as Claire rose
K20 0270  2    to go, he asked her to sing him one song before she
K20 0270 14    left. She sang him Scott's charming ballad "Rosabelle",
K20 0280  8    which was the vogue of the moment. She had never sung
K20 0290  9    better.
K20 0290 10       "Your voice is delightful", he approved with a warm
K20 0300  8    smile. "Tomorrow will be a new experience- I have never
K20 0310  8    before made love to a nightingale ... There have been
K20 0320  5    cooing doves, chattering magpies, thieving jackdaws,
K20 0330  1    a proud peacock, a silly goose, and a harpy eagle-
K20 0330 11    whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now
K20 0340 10    busy tearing at my vitals".
K20 0350  1       And so they went, he choosing of all places an inn
K20 0350 12    near Medmenham Abbey, scene a generation ago of the
K20 0360  8    obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club. He regaled Claire
K20 0370  5    with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked
K20 0380  4    bloods, which he had had at firsthand from old Bud
K20 0390  2    Dodington, one of the leaders of the so-called "Order".
K20 0390 12    Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this,
K20 0400 10    it seems, was not employed for self-flagellation ...
K20 0410  6    Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey, the
K20 0420  5    youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen
K20 0430  1    to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.
K20 0430  9       The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous
K20 0440  8    rites with relish. Alas, all that belonged to the age
K20 0450  7    of "Devil Dashwood" and "Wicked Wilkes", abbot and
K20 0460  4    beadsman of the Order! The casual seduction of a
K20 0470   3   seventeen-year-old
K20 0470  6    bluestocking seemed tame by comparison.
K20 0480  1       They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate. A
K20 0480 10    scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless
K20 0490  7    sitting on their diminutive terrace, the air about
K20 0500  4    them scented with stock, and listening to the nightingale
K20 0510  1    who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of
K20 0510 13    the garden. Charming and peaceful- but what were charm
K20 0520  7    and peace compared to high adventure? Alone with the
K20 0530  4    fabulous Byron! How many women had longed for the privilege
K20 0540  4    that was hers.
K20 0540  7       How was she to behave, Claire wondered. To be passive,
K20 0550  5    to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd. She was the
K20 0560  4    pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem.
K20 0570  1    And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience,
K20 0570 10    satiety might well be an equal handicap. No, she would
K20 0580  9    not pretend modesty, but neither must she be crudely
K20 0590  6    bold. Mystery- that was the thing. In the bedroom she
K20 0600  4    would insist on darkness. With his club foot he might
K20 0610  1    well be grateful.
K20 0610  4       At the inn, which was situated close to a broad
K20 0620  2    weir, Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious
K20 0620 11    deference and addressed as "milord". The place was
K20 0630  8    evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what
K20 0640  6    other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable
K20 0650  4    rooms to which they were shown.
K20 0650 10       The fire in the sitting room was lighted.
K20 0660  7       "What about the bedroom"? Byron inquired. "Seems
K20 0670  4    to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke
K20 0680  3    as it might have been preparing us for hell".
K20 0690  1       "We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney,
K20 0690 12    milord, but I promise you you'll never have trouble
K20 0700  8    of that sort again".
K20 0710  1       So, not only had he been here before, but it seemed
K20 0710 12    he might well come again. Claire felt suddenly small
K20 0720  7    and cheap, heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous
K20 0730  5    history of Don Juan.
K20 0730  9       A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port.
K20 0740  8    When Napoleon's ship had borne him to Elba, French
K20 0750  5    wines had started to cross the Channel, the first shipments
K20 0760  2    in a dozen war-ridden years, but the supplies had not
K20 0760 13    yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines
K20 0770  8    of the Spanish peninsula still ruled.
K20 0780  3       As they waited for supper they sat by the fire,
K20 0790  2    glasses in hand, while Byron philosophized as much
K20 0790 10    for his own entertainment as hers.
K20 0800  4       "Sex is overpriced", he said. "The great Greek tragedies
K20 0810  4    are concerned with man against Fate, not man against
K20 0820  3    man for the prize of a woman's body. So don't see yourself
K20 0830  1    as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event
K20 0830 12    of major importance".
K20 0840  2       "The gods seemed to think sex pretty important",
K20 0850  1    she rebutted. "Mars and Venus, Bacchus and Ariadne,
K20 0850  9    Jupiter and Io, Byron and the nymph of the owl's nest.
K20 0860 11    That would be Minerva, I suppose. Wasn't the owl her
K20 0870  8    symbol"?
K20 0870  9       Byron laughed. "So you know something of the classics,
K20 0880  9    do you"?
K20 0890  1       "Tell me about Minerva, how she behaved, what she
K20 0890 10    did to please you".
K20 0900  2       "I'll tell you nothing. I don't ask you who 'tis
K20 0910  1    you're being unfaithful to, husband or lover. Frankly,
K20 0910  9    I don't care".
K20 0920  2       For a moment she thought of answering with the truth
K20 0930  1    but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity,
K20 0930 12    who demanded some degree of education in body as well
K20 0950  8    as mind.
K20 0950 10       "Very well", she said, "I'll not catechize you.
K20 0960  7    What matter the others so long as I have my place in
K20 0970  7    history".
K20 0970  8       She was striking the right note. No man ever had
K20 0980  6    a better opinion of himself and indeed, with one so
K20 0990  3    favored, flattery could hardly seem overdone. Brains
K20 0990 10    and beauty, high position in both the social and intellectual
K20 1000  9    worlds, athlete, fabled lover- if ever the world was
K20 1010  8    any man's oyster it was his.
K20 1020  1       The light supper over, Claire went to him and, slipping
K20 1020 11    an arm about his shoulder, sat on his knee. He drew
K20 1030 10    her close and, hand on cheek, turned her face to his.
K20 1040  7    Her lips, moist and parted, spoke his name.
K20 1050  2       "Byron"!
K20 1050  3       His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the
K20 1060  4    knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown;
K20 1070  1    then, to better purpose, he took hold of the knot and
K20 1070 12    with dextrous fingers, untied it. The bodice beneath
K20 1080  7    was buttoned and, withdrawing his lips from hers, he
K20 1090  6    set her upright on his knee and started to undo it,
K20 1100  3    unhurriedly as if she were a child.
K20 1100 10       But, kindled by his kiss, his caressing hand, her
K20 1110  7    desire was aflame. She sprang up and went swiftly to
K20 1120  4    the bedroom. Lord Byron poured himself another glass
K20 1130  1    of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring
K20 1130 12    the rich color. He drank slowly with due appreciation.
K20 1140  7    It was an excellent vintage.
K20 1150  1       He rose and went to the bedroom. Pausing in the
K20 1150 11    doorway he said: "The form of the human female, unlike
K20 1160  8    her mind and her spirit, is the most challenging loveliness
K20 1170  6    in all nature".
K20 1170  9    ##
K20 1170 10    When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell
K20 1180  8    them she had become Byron's mistress. By odd coincidence,
K20 1190  6    on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read
K20 1200  5    Parisina, which was the latest of the titled poet's
K20 1210  2    successes. As he declaimed the sonorous measures, it
K20 1210 10    was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself
K20 1220 10    from bursting out with her dramatic tidings.
K20 1230  4       "Although it is not the best of which he is capable",
K20 1240  4    said Shelley as he closed the book, "it is still poetry
K20 1250  2    of a high order".
K20 1250  6       "If he would only leave the East", said Mary. "I
K20 1260  4    am tired of sultans and scimitars".
K20 1270  1       "The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte",
K20 1270  9    said Claire, with slightly overdone carelessness.
K20 1280  5       "How do you know that"? demanded Mary.
K20 1290  3       "I was told it on good authority", Claire answered
K20 1300  3    darkly. "I mustn't tell, I mustn't tell", she repeated
K20 1310  3    to herself. "I promised him I wouldn't".
K20 1310 10    #CHAPTER 9#
K20 1320  2    WINTER CAME, and with it Mary's baby- a boy as she
K20 1330  1    had wished. William, he was called, in honor of the
K20 1330 11    man who was at once Shelley's pensioner and his most
K20 1340  6    bitter detractor. With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote
K20 1350  4    to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter:
K20 1360  2       "Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad to
K20 1370  2    hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable
K20 1370 12    confinement, and that her child is well".
K20 1380  7       At the same time another child- this one of Shelley's
K20 1390  5    brain- was given to the world: Alastor, a poem of pervading
K20 1400  6    beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still
K20 1410  4    depths of a fine mind's musings. Alastor was published
K20 1420  1    only to be savagely attacked, contemptuously ignored.
K20 1420  8    Shelley sent a copy to Southey, a former friend, and
K20 1430 10    another to Godwin. Neither acknowledged the gift.
K20 1440  4       Only Mary's praise sustained him in his disappointment.
K20 1450  4    She understood completely. Not a thought nor a cadence
K20 1460  3    was missed in her summary of appreciation.
K20 1460 10       "You have made the labor worth while", he said to
K20 1470 10    her, smiling. "And in the future, since I write for
K20 1480  7    a public of one, I can save the poor publishers from
K20 1490  3    wasting their money".
K20 1490  6       "A public of one", Mary echoed reprovingly. "how
K20 1500  5    can you say such a thing? There will be thousands who
K20 1510  5    will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor. There are
K20 1520  2    some even now. What about that dear, clever Mr. Thynne?
K20 1530  1    I am sure he is in raptures".
K20 1530  8       "Poor Mr. Thynne, he always has to be trotted out
K20 1540  7    for my encouragement".
K20 1540 10       "There are other Mr. Thynnes. Not everyone is bewitched
K20 1550  9    by Byron's caliphs and harem beauties".
K20 1560  5       Mary's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing
K20 1570  5    to do with his moral disrepute. She was resentful of
K20 1580  2    his easy success as compared with Shelley's failure.
K20 1580 10    The same month that Alastor was published, Murray sold
K20 1590  8    twenty thousand copies of The Siege of Corinth, a slovenly
K20 1600  9    bit of Byronism that even Shelley's generosity rebelled
K20 1610  5    at.
K20 1610  6    ##
K20 1610  7    The lordly poet was at low-water mark. The careless
K20 1620  7    writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent.
K20 1630  4    On all sides doors were being slammed in his face.
K20 1640  2    The previous scandals, gaily diverting as they were,
K20 1640 10    had only served to increase his popularity. Now, under
K20 1650  8    the impact of his wife's disclosures, he was brought
K20 1660  5    suddenly to the realization that there was a limit
K20 1670  4    to tolerance, however brilliant, however far-famed
K20 1670 11    the offender might be. He tried defiance and openly
K20 1680  8    flaunted his devotion to his half sister, but he soon
K20 1690  8    saw, as did she, that this course if persisted in would
K20 1700  3    involve them in a common ruin. For the moment there
K20 1710  1    was no woman in his life, and it was this vacuum that
K20 1710 13    had given Claire her opportunity.
K20 1720  3       But the liaison successfully started in the last
K20 1730  2    days of autumn was now languishing. Byron, since the
K20 1730 11    separation from his wife had been living in a smallish
K20 1740 10    house in Piccadilly Terrace. He refused to bring Claire
K20 1750  6    to it even as an occasional visitor, claiming that
K20 1760  3    his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes.
