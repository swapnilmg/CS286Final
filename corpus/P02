P02 0010  1       People came in and out all evening to see the baby
P02 0010 12    and hold it. The room filled with smoke, and Maggie's
P02 0020  8    head throbbed with excitement and fatigue, but Stuart
P02 0030  5    had such a happy, earnest look of proud possession
P02 0040  2    on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything
P02 0040 12    to quench it.
P02 0050  3       Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery.
P02 0060  1    In two months she became a fat highly social baby,
P02 0060 11    with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head. She stopped
P02 0070 10    flying into rages and started digesting her food; she
P02 0080  6    developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny
P02 0090  4    disposition, and she asked for nothing more of life
P02 0100  1    than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge
P02 0100 12    amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried
P02 0110  7    to where she could watch activity going on around her.
P02 0120  5       She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting
P02 0130  3    her and taking care of her. Maggie couldn't seem to
P02 0140  1    get her strength back or catch up with herself with
P02 0140 11    all she had to do: there was the big basket of clothes
P02 0150  8    to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged
P02 0160  5    out and lugged back; there was the daily round of household
P02 0170  3    chores in which Maggie insisted on participating. Worry
P02 0180  1    had a great deal to do with it; Stuart had been laid
P02 0180 13    off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting
P02 0190 10    in his father's office, taking what salary his father
P02 0200  6    could hand out to him. Mr. Clifton would have preferred
P02 0210  4    death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his
P02 0220  2    wife's people without contributing to his and his family's
P02 0230  1    upkeep, and besides that there were the things that
P02 0230 10    had to be bought for the baby, milk and orange juice
P02 0240  5    and vitamins and soap, just plain soap. Maggie and
P02 0250  3    Stuart pored over figures every night, trying to find
P02 0250 12    how they could squeeze out a few pennies more.
P02 0260  9       In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon:
P02 0270  5    "Do you think you could find me something I could do
P02 0280  7    here at home to make some money, so I could still watch
P02 0290  3    the baby and do the rest of the things"?
P02 0300  1       "It seems to me you have enough to do as it is",
P02 0300 12    Eugenia said. She had been watching Maggie go from
P02 0310  7    the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back
P02 0320  5    again.
P02 0320  6       "I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing
P02 0330  5    something", Maggie said. "It would make me feel a lot
P02 0340  4    better, but the Woman's Exchange isn't taking baked
P02 0340 12    goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma
P02 0350 11    because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too
P02 0360  8    young to be put in a nursery".
P02 0370  1       "I should think so", Eugenia said. "For one thing
P02 0380  1    you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses
P02 0380 10    and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day".
P02 0390  7       "She's so beautiful, and I do like to keep her looking
P02 0400  9    nice". Maggie said. She picked up the baby and nuzzled
P02 0410  6    her fat warm little neck.
P02 0410 11       "She'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't
P02 0420  9    have to be ironed", Eugenia said. "Evadna Mae Evans
P02 0430  6    said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel
P02 0440  6    wrapper until it was nine months old".
P02 0450  1       "Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from
P02 0450 10    Best's Liliputian Bazaar in New York, and I'm sick
P02 0460  8    and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans".
P02 0470  4       "Well now, Maggie, you don't have to snap at me",
P02 0480  6    Eugenia said. "I'm just thinking of a way for you to
P02 0490  4    be sensible".
P02 0490  6       "I'm sorry. I do seem to snap at everybody these
P02 0500  4    days, but I would like to think of a way to make a
P02 0510  2    little extra money".
P02 0510  5       "Well, let's see. Let's make a list of your assets".
P02 0520  6       Maggie started laughing, and she laughed so hard
P02 0530  3    she couldn't stop, and she kept on laughing while she
P02 0530 13    lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up
P02 0540 11    while the sun was still shining. When she came back
P02 0550  6    Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil
P02 0560  4    and envelope jotting down words and figures.
P02 0570  1       "I have here that you could run a nursery of your
P02 0570 11    own for working mothers", Eugenia said. "We could put
P02 0590  6    up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn
P02 0600  5    the front bedroom into a playroom where it's nice and
P02 0610  3    sunny, but of course it would entail quite a bit of
P02 0610 14    running up and down stairs and Chris said you were
P02 0620 10    to be careful about that".
P02 0630  1       "What else"?
P02 0630  3       "You might set up a dress shop in the living room".
P02 0640  3       "Every woman in the block has tried that".
P02 0650  1       "What about a tea room, then? You could set up tables
P02 0660  1    in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans
P02 0660 12    and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy
P02 0670  8    and tell fortunes".
P02 0680  1       "It's too elaborate. And Grandma isn't strong enough
P02 0680  9    to take on something like that, and to tell you the
P02 0690 10    truth neither am I".
P02 0700  1       Eugenia sighed. She said, "Well, those are the really
P02 0700 10    interesting things, but if you don't like any of those
P02 0710 10    I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you,
P02 0720  8    if you think you can type well enough".
P02 0730  1       "Oh, I'm sure I could do that", Maggie said. "But
P02 0740  1    it really wouldn't be fair, taking your jobs away from
P02 0740 11    you".
P02 0750  1       "Don't worry, I can get plenty more", Eugenia said,
P02 0750 10    wondering where in the world she could. Maggie was
P02 0760  9    looking much happier already, clearing a space on the
P02 0770  7    table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter
P02 0780  5    right there, and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia
P02 0790  3    wouldn't be ashamed of it. "And then whenever I have
P02 0800  1    a minute I can be working at it, and keep an eye on
P02 0800 14    the baby and the stove at the same time. And I can
P02 0810  9    go back to my contests and be thinking while I'm doing
P02 0820  4    the washing".
P02 0820  6       "What are you going to do with your feet so you
P02 0830  8    don't waste anything"?
P02 0830 11       Maggie laughed. She said, "Oh Eugenia, I wish ..."
P02 0840  9       "What"?
P02 0850  1       "I wish I had three wishes", Maggie said. "All of
P02 0860  2    them for you".
P02 0860  5    ##
P02 0860  6    It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November, contributing
P02 0870  2    to the miseries of countless numbers of people. The
P02 0880  2    temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood
P02 0880 11    at zero during the days. The cold settled like a tangible
P02 0890  9    pall over the Mile High City, locking it in an icy
P02 0900  8    grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical
P02 0910  4    appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism, resembling
P02 0920  2    other cities whose habitual climate was cold, instead
P02 0920 10    of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western
P02 0930  8    city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains
P02 0940  7    stored with endless riches and resources.
P02 0950  2       The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment
P02 0960  1    offices, outside newspaper buildings, in parks, in
P02 0960  8    relief lines, outside government agencies. There weren't
P02 0970  6    facilities to take care of them; there never had been
P02 0980  7    a need felt for such facilities. That kind of poverty
P02 0990  4    was regarded as the exclusive property of the East,
P02 1000  1    which created depressions with their stock markets
P02 1000  8    and their congested populations and their greedy centralization
P02 1010  6    of industries, protected by discriminatory freight
P02 1020  4    rates. The East was popularly supposed to have got
P02 1030  4    the country into war and into depression, dragging
P02 1030 12    the west along; and now the East was creating government
P02 1040  9    agencies for which the West doubtless would have to
P02 1050  7    pay.
P02 1050  8       The government offices were being opened but they
P02 1060  6    weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the
P02 1070  2    cold penetrated everything. Shivering, people talked
P02 1070  8    and argued; all this government spending would have
P02 1080  8    to be paid for somehow, but on the other hand desperate
P02 1090  7    circumstances called for desperate remedies and something
P02 1100  4    had to be done.
P02 1100  8       Something had to be done; it was the theme song
P02 1110  6    of millions of American people, their personal problems
P02 1120  2    no less urgent than those of the government. Something
P02 1130  1    had to be done. The Abernathys said it to each other
P02 1130 12    a dozen times a day.
P02 1140  3       Something had to be done about the furnace, the
P02 1140 12    fuel bills, the washing machine, the doctor and dentist
P02 1150  8    bills, about making money stretch for food, for the
P02 1160  7    mortgage, for taxes, for shoes, for half soles, for
P02 1161  3    overshoes, for clothes, for the new leaks in the roof,
P02 1170 10    for gas and light bills; about keeping warm, about
P02 1180  8    keeping well, about meeting the minor emergencies that
P02 1190  5    came up once, twice, fifty times a day. Just dropping
P02 1200  3    the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe,
P02 1210  1    and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed
P02 1210 13    a major disaster.
P02 1220  2       The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant
P02 1230  1    ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons
P02 1230 11    of coal into its evil red depths, and no matter how
P02 1240  8    much coal they put in the house remained cold. Cold
P02 1250  3    came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have
P02 1250 12    sprung up, under doors, around loosened window frames,
P02 1260  8    from the sleeping porches, the attic, from the widened
P02 1270  7    cracks between shingles on the roof. Presently they
P02 1280  4    had to give up running the furnace at full capacity
P02 1290  1    and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen, which
P02 1290 12    had never been removed when the new gas range was installed,
P02 1300  9    and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma's
P02 1310  6    room. It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of
P02 1320  5    desperate gaiety infected all of them, like people
P02 1330  1    stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak
P02 1330 10    of circumstance so that time stood still and minor
P02 1340  8    anxieties fell away and the only important thing was
P02 1350  4    to cling together and survive.
P02 1350  9       The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in
P02 1360  9    ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms.
P02 1370  5    They lived mainly in the kitchen; they moved Maggie's
P02 1380  3    bed and the baby's basket there, and the rest of them
P02 1390  2    undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering
P02 1390 11    to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds.
P02 1400  8    Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp
P02 1410  6    days, and it was the way people ought to live, only
P02 1420  2    she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it
P02 1420 13    that she used to.
P02 1430  3       "You said a mouthful", Eugenia said grimly. Eugenia
P02 1440  1    hated being cold worse than anything, and she was beginning
P02 1440 11    to find the joys of poverty wearing thin. She said
P02 1450 10    to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency
P02 1460  7    and another to wallow in it, and it was beginning to
P02 1470  3    look at if this one was going to last forever.
P02 1480  1       "Plenty of people are poor all their lives".
P02 1480  9       "Plenty of people haven't our brains and talent".
P02 1490  7       "I know you when you start talking about brains
P02 1500  6    and talent", Maggie said. "You're working up to something,
P02 1510  5    and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life
P02 1520  4    one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy
P02 1530  1    family is superior to everything, even a depression".
P02 1530  9       "The only thing that worries me is how I'm going
P02 1540 10    to prove it", Eugenia said.
P02 1550  2       They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the
P02 1550 13    kitchen for her, but Grandma said she was getting too
P02 1560 10    old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth
P02 1570  8    out, and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian
P02 1580  5    and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it
P02 1590  3    would have to be that way. She didn't want to be the
P02 1590 15    only one with a stove in her room, especially as her
P02 1600 11    life span was nearly run out anyway, and she insisted
P02 1610  7    that Hope have the heater. Hope wouldn't hear of it,
P02 1620  4    and she took the heater back to Grandma's room, and
P02 1630  2    Grandma took it back to Hope's room, and the two of
P02 1630 13    them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped
P02 1640  8    it over and almost set her bedspread on fire. She said
P02 1650  6    that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in
P02 1670  5    her room, and she could be burned to a crisp without
P02 1670 16    anybody knowing it. Eugenia suspected her of deliberately
P02 1680  8    overturning the heater because she was getting tired
P02 1690  7    of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her
P02 1700  5    own way, but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the
P02 1710  2    heater nobody would have it, so Grandma had to give
P02 1710 12    in.
