E14 0010  1       DO start fires one or two hours ahead of time to
E14 0010 12    obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals. Keep ashes from
E14 0020  9    one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if
E14 0030  6    they are too hot, and to stop flames that arise from
E14 0040  3    melting grease.
E14 0040  5       Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect
E14 0050  5    heat.
E14 0050  6       Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting
E14 0060  5    with sauces. Clean it meticulously in boiling water
E14 0070  2    and detergent, rinse thoroughly.
E14 0070  6       Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches
E14 0080  8    in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit.
E14 0090  5    Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood
E14 0100  2    for heating vegetables, sauces and such.
E14 0100  8       Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of
E14 0110 10    aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface
E14 0120  5    of steaks and chops. Sear on both sides then cover
E14 0130  2    meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest
E14 0130 10    results.
E14 0140  1       Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test
E14 0140 10    them. If doubtful about a steak, boldly cut it in half.
E14 0150  9    If necessary to replace both halves on grill, sear
E14 0160  6    cuts and allot extra time. For roasts, insert meat
E14 0170  2    thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone.
E14 0170 11    Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving
E14 0180  8    spit or hit the coals.
E14 0190  1       Don't practice a new recipe on guests. Have a test-run
E14 0200  1    on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning
E14 0200 11    are right.
E14 0210  1       Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend
E14 0210 12    to cook it. Keep it no longer than 36 hours before
E14 0220  8    cooking, and keep it in the coldest (but non-freezing)
E14 0230  4    compartment of the refrigerator.
E14 0230  8       Don't plan meals that are too complicated. Limit
E14 0240  8    yourself to good meat and drink, with bread, salad,
E14 0250  6    corn or potatoes as accessories. Keep the desserts
E14 0260  3    simple; fruit does nicely.
E14 0260  7       Do whatever kitchen work, such as fixing a salad,
E14 0270  7    preparing garlic bread, or making a marinade sauce,
E14 0280  4    ahead of time. When you start the outdoor performance,
E14 0290  1    you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips
E14 0290 10    into the kitchen. (This goes for getting a drink tray
E14 0300  8    ready, and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand
E14 0310  6    long before the party begins.)
E14 0311  1       Don't think you have to start with the most expensive
E14 0320 10    equipment in the world. The simplest grill (pan type)
E14 0330  7    or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef. You need
E14 0340  6    tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning potatoes
E14 0350  2    and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times. And lots
E14 0350 13    of hot pads!
E14 0360  2       Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so
E14 0360 12    that when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames
E14 0370 11    cannot reach the meat.
E14 0380  2       Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates,
E14 0390  1    bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use.
E14 0390  9    Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine
E14 0400  5    dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and
E14 0410  5    dozens of colors. There is even one set that has "barbecue"
E14 0420  5    written on it.
E14 0420  8       Do without fancy tablecloths. It's cheaper to buy
E14 0430  6    Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table. Or buy half
E14 0440  5    a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for
E14 0450  2    different kinds of barbecues. Oilcloth only costs about
E14 0450 10    79c a yard for the very best. Tougher than plastic,
E14 0460  9    it wears well.
E14 0470  1       Don't forget- when you take to the hills or the
E14 0470 11    beach- that your cooler, which you might have used
E14 0480  8    for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard,
E14 0490  5    is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.
E14 0500  1    There are many varieties of coolers and they serve
E14 0500 10    many purposes. With them, you can carry steaks and
E14 0510  8    hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures, and also get
E14 0520  4    your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the marina
E14 0530  2    or picnic, in A-1 condition.
E14 0530  8       Do use paper napkins; lots of them. Except when
E14 0540  6    you prepare "do it yourself" shish kebob or a lobster
E14 0550  5    roast. Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping
E14 0560  3    up.
E14 0560  4       Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes,
E14 0570  1    or seasonal. It's year-round, and everywhere. In the
E14 0570 10    winter, hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs
E14 0580 10    of the fireplace. Even use your portable electric or
E14 0590  6    gas grill in the winter, inside. Summertime supper,
E14 0600  2    outside, is a natural. You'll find, once your technique
E14 0610  1    is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple
E14 0610 13    Bernz-O-Matic.
E14 0620  1       Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups. Get copper or earthenware
E14 0630  2    mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot. Be sure to
E14 0630 13    get a few more than you need. You will discover you
E14 0640 11    keep the sauce for basting meat in one, use six for
E14 0650  7    drinks, serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen-
E14 0660  3    and need one more to mix the salad dressing.
E14 0670  1       Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road. If
E14 0670 11    you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will, no doubt,
E14 0680  7    discover that feeding is an expensive business. Decide
E14 0690  4    in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to
E14 0700  2    work. You can take it with you ... a picnic bag, a
E14 0710  1    grill, a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen
E14 0720 11    convenience foods. Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings
E14 0730  7    and evenings; or just evenings. Turn off at any one
E14 0740  6    of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies have
E14 0750  2    touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national
E14 0750 10    parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities)
E14 0760  8    and- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up,
E14 0770  6    hamburger, buns, an array of relishes, and fresh fruit-
E14 0780  4    your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant, and
E14 0790  2    100% more fun. You need a little stove, a coffee pot
E14 0790 13    and a stew pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials
E14 0800  9    like salt, pepper, plates, forks, knives and a can
E14 0810  6    opener. As you pull out of your motel or national park
E14 0820  3    home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what
E14 0820 14    you need for the next meal. For 25c load up the cooler
E14 0830 12    with ice and keep cool pop in the car.
E14 0850  1    #SIMPLE MEAT DISHES#
E14 0850  4    SPICE is a fact of life in the U.S.A. You only have
E14 0860  8    to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean.
E14 0870  6    Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue
E14 0880  2    basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst,
E14 0890  1    bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni,
E14 0890  6    blutwurst- and you have a long list of easy specialties.
E14 0900  9    Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes, a bit
E14 0910  6    of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom- any one of
E14 0920  6    these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a
E14 0920 18    feast.
E14 0930  1       Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite.
E14 0930 12    A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St.
E14 0940 10    Louis, around 1883 served his sausages (grilled) and
E14 0950  7    mustard to his fancy customers. So that his customers
E14 0960  5    should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued white
E14 0970  2    gloves. Discovery that the gloves frequently left with
E14 0970 10    the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat
E14 0980 10    come upon a compromise. He had a bakery make buns sized
E14 0990  8    to fit his franks. Years later, franks-in-buns were
E14 1000  5    accepted as the "first to go" at the New York Polo
E14 1010  3    Grounds.
E14 1010  4       The nations's number one picnic treat is the skinless
E14 1020  4    frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or,
E14 1030  1    more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill.
E14 1030  9    Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease
E14 1040 10    of preparation. To make the picnic frank come close
E14 1050  5    to perfection, remember these tips:
E14 1060  2       -Score each frankfurter in four or five places about
E14 1060 11    a third of the way through. This permits the juices
E14 1070  8    to permeate the meat during cooking.
E14 1080  1       -Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank
E14 1090  1    as are buns. Bring along the conventional ones- catsup,
E14 1090 10    pickle relish, mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras,
E14 1100  7    such as tangy barbecue sauce, chive cream cheese, or
E14 1110  6    horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.
E14 1120  2       -Using a portable grill permits you to toast the
E14 1120 11    buns, too. Watch closely while browning them, as it
E14 1130  9    doesn't take long.
E14 1140  2       -An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating
E14 1140 10    the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey,
E14 1150  9    lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic. Broil
E14 1160  6    or toast as usual.
E14 1160 10       Contrary to popular opinion, "a la mode" doesn't
E14 1170  7    mean "with ice cream"- it just means, in the latest
E14 1180  9    style. Here are a couple of the latest, highly styled
E14 1190  3    ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard!
E14 1195  1    You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as
E14 1200  9    their mouths watering!
E14 1210  1    _JIFFY BARBECUES_
E14 1210  3       1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue
E14 1220  2    sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped,
E14 1230  1    spiced ham 6 sandwich buns, heated
E14 1230  7       Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan; heat thoroughly.
E14 1240  5    Add ham; heat. Serve on buns. Makes 6 barbecues.
E14 1250  4    _HOT HIBACHI FRANKS_
E14 1250  7       You'll never hear "sayonara", the Japanese word
E14 1260  4    for goodbye, from your guests when you give a hibachi
E14 1270  4    party. The fun of toasting their own sausages over
E14 1270 13    the small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them
E14 1280  8    in tasty sauces will keep your group busy- try it and
E14 1290  8    see!
E14 1300  1    _CANNED COCKTAIL FRANKFURTERS_
E14 1300  1       _SWEET-SOUR SAUCE_

E14 1350  2    whipped Salt Paprika
E14 1350  5       Spear canned cocktail franks with picks. Also spear
E14 1360  5    pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl.
E14 1370  1       Make sauces ahead. Sweet-sour sauce can be kept
E14 1370 10    warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal
E14 1380  7    in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage. Mustard
E14 1390  4    cream, used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple
E14 1400  2    tidbits, tastes best when served at room temperature.
E14 1410  1       For sweet-sour sauce, cook onion in oil until soft.
E14 1410 10    Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer
E14 1420  7    about 10 minutes, and keep warm for serving.
E14 1430  3       To prepare mustard cream, blend mustard with enough
E14 1440  1    water to make a thin paste. Fold into whipped cream
E14 1440 11    and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika.
E14 1450  7    _TRIM-YOUR-OWN-FRANKS_
E14 1450 11       A back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and
E14 1460  6    a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way
E14 1470  6    to entertain guests this summer. Be sure to have plenty
E14 1480  3    of frankfurters and buns on hand. Some tasty frank
E14 1480 12    toppings are chili con carne, Coney Island sauce and
E14 1490  9    savory sauerkraut. Serve the chili and kraut hot with
E14 1500  7    the franks.
E14 1500  9       Here are suggestions for the frankfurter trimmings:
E14 1510  5    _1._
E14 1510  6       Chili con carne: use canned chili con carne.
E14 1520  5    _2._
E14 1520  6       Coney Island sauce: finely chop several onions and
E14 1530  4    add enough catsup to moisten well; add prepared mustard
E14 1540  2    to suit taste.
E14 1540  5    _3._
E14 1540  6       Savory sauerkraut: add several tablespoons of brown
E14 1550  3    sugar to a can of sauerkraut. Add a few caraway seeds,
E14 1560  1    too, if you'd like.
E14 1560  5    _BARBECUED FRANKFURTERS_
E14 1560  7       1/2 cup minced celery 1/4 cup minced onion 1/2 cup

E14 1580  5    brown sugar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon
E14 1590  3    prepared mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 frankfurters
E14 1600  1       Combine first 9 ingredients in skillet. Simmer 15
E14 1600  9    minutes. Prick frankfurters with fork; place in sauce.
E14 1610  7    Cover; simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
E14 1620  4    sauce is of desired consistency. Serve in frankfurter
E14 1630  3    buns or as a meat dish. Makes 8 sandwiches or 4 servings.
E14 1640  2    _PRETEND HAM_
E14 1640  4       Make criss-cross gashes on one side of skinless
E14 1650  1    frankfurters. Stick 4 or 5 cloves in each frank, ham
E14 1650 11    fashion. Make a paste of brown sugar and mustard and
E14 1660 10    spread lightly over scored surface. If desired, sprinkle
E14 1670  5    with 1 teaspoon drained crushed pineapple. Place on
E14 1680  3    rectangle of foil and pinch edges together tightly.
E14 1680 11    Roast on grill over coals 15-20 minutes.
E14 1690  8    _FRANKFURTER TWISTS_
E14 1690 10       Blend 2 cups biscuit mix with 2/3 cup milk to make
E14 1700 11    a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured board and roll
E14 1710  6    out to form a **f-inch rectangle. Spread dough with
E14 1720  3    a mixture of 3 tablespoons chili sauce, 1 teaspoon
E14 1720 12    horse-radish and 2 teaspoons mustard. Cut dough carefully
E14 1730  8    into 12 strips, about 3/4 inch by a foot long. Twist
E14 1740  9    one strip diagonally around each skinless frankfurter,
E14 1750  3    pinching dough at ends to seal it. Brush frankfurter
E14 1760  1    twists with about 1/2 cup melted butter and toast slowly
E14 1760 11    over glowing coals until dough is golden brown. Serves
E14 1770  9    12.
E14 1780  1    _HAMBURGER PATTIES WITH NUTS_
E14 1780  3       1 pound ground beef 2 teaspoons grated onion Dash
E14 1790  1    of pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
E14 1790 10    1/4 cup ice cold bourbon
E14 1800  2       Combine ingredients; form into patties and barbecue
