N29 0010  1    "Bastards", he would say, "all I did was put a beat
N29 0010 12    to that Vivaldi stuff, and the first chair clobbered
N29 0020  7    me"! Since then, and since the pure grain had gotten
N29 0030  7    him divorced from every decent- and even indecent-
N29 0040  3    group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero, he
N29 0050  2    had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper.
N29 0050  9       "There ain't nothin' faster, or lonelier, or more
N29 0060  7    direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go
N29 0080  5    someplace", Feathertop would say. "The accommodations
N29 0090  1    may not be the poshest, but man! there ain't nobody
N29 0100  1    askin' for your ticket stub, neither".
N29 0110  4       He had been conning the freights for a long, long
N29 0120  7    time now. Ever since the hooch, and the trouble with
N29 0130  3    the Quartet, and Midge and the child. Ever since all
N29 0140  1    that. It had been a very long time that had no form
N29 0140 13    and no end.
N29 0150  1       He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of
N29 0150 11    a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out.
N29 0160  8    Out and out and never to return again. Till one day
N29 0170  5    the last freight had been jumped, the last pint had
N29 0180  2    been killed, the last beat had been rapped. That was
N29 0180 12    the day it ended.
N29 0190  2    ##
N29 0190  3    THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD, early in the morning.
N29 0200  1       He was pressed far back into the corner of the car
N29 0200 12    on his hay sacks, the rattling and tinning of the wheels
N29 0210  8    on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina.
N29 0220  6       He held his elbows away from his body, and the little
N29 0230  5    sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled
N29 0240  1    its tune-belly.
N29 0240  4       The train slowed at a road crossing, and the big
N29 0250  3    door slid open; at first gratingly, caught by grains
N29 0250 12    of corn- then with a clash into its slot.
N29 0260 10       The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her
N29 0270  7    on the lip of the floor. She pulled her legs up under
N29 0280  3    her, to rise, her full peasant skirt drawing up her
N29 0280 13    thighs, and Feathertop's music pffft-ed away. "Now
N29 0290  2    that is a very nice, a very nice", he murmured to himself,
N29 0300  8    back in his corner.
N29 0310  1       A little thing, but the right twist for the action
N29 0310 10    that counted. Hot, that was the word, hot! Hair like
N29 0320  8    a morning-frightened sparrow's wings, with the sun
N29 0330  5    shining down over them. A poet, yet! His thoughts for
N29 0340  2    the swanlike neck, the full, high breasts, the slim
N29 0340 11    waist, and the long legs were less than poetic, however.
N29 0350  9       Zingggg-O!
N29 0360  1       Then the boy straight-armed himself up, twisting
N29 0360  9    at the last moment so he landed sitting.
N29 0370  6       He was less to see, but Feathertop took him in,
N29 0380  4    too, just to keep the records straight.
N29 0380 11       Curly hair, high cheekbones, wide gnomelike mouth,
N29 0390  7    a pair of drummer's blocky hands, and a body that said
N29 0400  8    well, maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes- but
N29 0410  4    then I'm finished.
N29 0410  7       "We made it, Cappy", the chick said.
N29 0420  4       "Yeah, seems so, don't it", the boy laughed, hugging
N29 0430  3    her close.
N29 0430  5       "Ah-ah"! Feathertop interrupted, standing up, brushing
N29 0440  4    the pig offal from his dirty pants. "None of that.
N29 0450  4    We run a respectable house here".
N29 0450 10       They whirled and saw him, standing there dim in
N29 0460  8    the slatted light from the boarded freight wall. He
N29 0470  4    was big, and filthy, and his toes stuck out of the
N29 0480  2    flapping tops of his shoes. He held the black plastic
N29 0480 12    kazoo lightly.
N29 0490  1       "Come sit", said Feathertop, motioning them toward
N29 0500  1    him. "That crap is softer over here".
N29 0500  8       The girl smiled, and started forward. The boy yanked
N29 0510  6    her back hard, tugging her off her feet, and gathered
N29 0520  4    her into the crook of his arm.
N29 0520 11       "Now stay with me, Kitty", he snapped irritably.
N29 0530  7    "I vowed to take care of you- and that's what I'm gonna
N29 0540  6    do. We don't know this guy".
N29 0550  1       "Oooo, square bit", Feathertop screwed his face
N29 0550  8    up. This guy was strictly from Outsville. But nowhere!
N29 0560  8       "What is with this vow jazz"? Feathertop inquired,
N29 0570  8    lounging against the freight's vibrating wall.
N29 0580  5       "We- we eloped", Cappy said. His head came up and
N29 0590  7    he said it defiantly.
N29 0590 11       "Well, congratulations". Feathertop made an elaborate
N29 0600  6    motion with his hand. These two were going to be easy
N29 0610  8    pickins. They couldn't have much dough, but then none
N29 0620  5    of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much. And
N29 0630  3    besides, the chick had a little something the others
N29 0630 12    didn't have. That was gonna be fun collecting!
N29 0640  8       But not just yet. Feathertop was a connoisseur.
N29 0650  6    He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it. "Come
N29 0660  5    sit", he repeated, motioning to the piled hay bags,
N29 0670  3    over the pig leavings. "I'm just a poor ex-jazz man,
N29 0670 14    name of- uh- Boyd Smith". He grinned at them wolfishly.
N29 0690  1       "That ain't your name, Mister", the boy accused.
N29 0690  9       "And you know- you're right"! Feathertop aimed a
N29 0700  8    finger at him.
N29 0710  2       "Oh, come on, Cappy", the girl chided. "He's okay.
N29 0720  2    He's a nice guy". She started to move toward the hay
N29 0720 13    bags, dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her.
N29 0730  7       Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her
N29 0740  6    slim, trim legs as she walked to the bags, and tucked
N29 0750  3    them beneath her, smoothing the skirt out in a wide
N29 0750 13    circle. He cleared his throat; it had been a long,
N29 0760 10    hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this
N29 0770  7    within grabbin' distance.
N29 0780  1       He had it all doped, of course. Slug the kid, grab
N29 0780 12    his dough- at least enough to get to Philadelphia-
N29 0790  6    and then have a rockin' ball with the doll. Hmm- diddle!
N29 0800  6       "Where'd you come from, Mr.- uh- Mr. Smith"? Kitty
N29 0810  4    inquired politely.
N29 0820  1       "Where from"? he mused. "Out. I been riding train
N29 0820  9    for a ways now".
N29 0830  2       They lapsed into silence, and the freight wallowed
N29 0830 10    up a hill, scooted down the other side, shaking and
N29 0840 10    clanking to itself.
N29 0850  1       After a while, Kitty murmured something to Cappy,
N29 0850  9    and he held her close, answering, "We'll just have
N29 0860  7    to wait till we pull into Philly, honey".
N29 0870  3       "What's the matter, she wanna go the bathroom"?
N29 0880  2    Ernie found it immensely funny.
N29 0880  7       The boy scowled at him, and the girl looked shocked.
N29 0890  8       "No! Certainly not, I mean, no that isn't what I
N29 0900  8    said"! she snapped at him. "I only said I was hungry.
N29 0910  7    We haven't had anything to eat all day".
N29 0920  2       Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice
N29 0930  1    as he reached behind him, pulling out a battered carpet
N29 0930 11    bag, with leather handles. "Whyn't ya say so, fellow
N29 0940  8    travelers! Why, we got dinner right here. C'mon, buddy,
N29 0950  7    help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a
N29 0960  6    minute or two".
N29 0960  9       Cappy looked wary, but he moved off the floorboards
N29 0970  7    and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of
N29 0980  4    the refuse-littered boxcar.
N29 0980  8       Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag. He took
N29 0990  7    out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal, a
N29 1000  3    deep pot of thin metal, some sheets of newspaper, a
N29 1000 13    book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded
N29 1010 10    piece of tin foil with holes in it. He put the charcoal
N29 1020  8    in the pot, lit the paper with the matches, and carefully
N29 1030  4    stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot.
N29 1040  1       "A charcoal pit, man", he said, indicating the
N29 1040  9    slightly-smoking
N29 1050  1    makeshift brazier. "Fan it", he told Cappy, handing
N29 1050  9    him a sheet of newspaper.
N29 1060  5       "Yeah, but what're we gonna eat? Charcoal"?
N29 1070  2       "Fella", Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger
N29 1080  3    man, "you try my ever-lovin' patience". He reached
N29 1090  1    once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package
N29 1090 12    of wieners.
N29 1100  1       "Hot dogs, man. Not the greatest, but they stick
N29 1100 10    to your belly insides".
N29 1110  2       He ripped down the cellophane carefully, and laid
N29 1120  1    three dogs on the tin foil. Almost immediately they
N29 1120 10    began to sizzle. He looked up and grinned.
N29 1130  6       "A Kroger's self-serve", he explained. "I self served".
N29 1140  5    ##
N29 1140  6    WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the last of the wieners' taste
N29 1150  6    from their fingers, they settled back, and Cappy offered
N29 1160  4    Ernie a cigarette. Nice kid, Ernie thought, too bad.
N29 1170  3       "How come you're riding the rods, kids like you"?
N29 1180  1    Ernie asked.
N29 1180  3       Cappy looked down at his wide hands, and did not
N29 1190  3    reply. But surprisingly, Kitty's face came up and she
N29 1190 12    said, "My father. He didn't want us to get married.
N29 1200 10    So we ran away".
N29 1210  1       "Why didn't he want you to get hitched"?
N29 1220  1       This time even she did not answer. She looked down
N29 1220 11    at her hands, too. After a few seconds, she said, "Dad
N29 1230  8    didn't like Cappy. It was my fault".
N29 1240  3       Cappy's head came around sharply. "Your fault, hell!
N29 1250  2    It was all my fault. If I'd been careful it never woulda"-
N29 1260  3    he stopped abruptly.
N29 1260  6       Ernie's eyebrows went up. "What's the matter"?
N29 1270  3       The girl still did not raise her eyes, but she added
N29 1280  5    simply, "I'm pregnant".
N29 1280  8       Cappy raged at himself. "Oh he was stupid, her old
N29 1290  9    man! You never heard nothin' like it: Kitty's gonna
N29 1300  5    go have an abortion, and Kitty's gonna go away to a
N29 1310  6    convent, and Kitty's this and Kitty's that ... like
N29 1320  2    he was nuts or somethin', y'know"?
N29 1320  8       Ernie nodded. This was a slightly different matter.
N29 1330  7    He remembered Midge, and the child. But that had been
N29 1340  6    a time before all this, a time he didn't think about.
N29 1350  3    A time before the white lightning and the bumming had
N29 1360  1    turned him inside out. But these kids weren't like
N29 1360 10    him.
N29 1360 11       Oh crap! he thought, Pull out of it, old son. These
N29 1370 11    are just another couple of characters to roll. What
N29 1380  7    they got, you get. Now forget all this other.
N29 1390  4       "Wanna drink"? Ernie offered, taking the pint of
N29 1400  4    sweet lucy from his jacket pocket.
N29 1400 10       "Yeah. Now that you offer". The answer came from
N29 1410  8    the open door of the boxcar. From the man who had leaped
N29 1420  7    in from the high bank outside, as the train had slowed
N29 1430  3    on the grade.
N29 1430  6       Ernie stared at the man. He was big. Real big, with
N29 1440  5    shoulders out to here, and hair all over him like a
N29 1450  2    grizzly. Road gang, Ernie thought.
N29 1460  3       "You gonna give me a drink, fella"? the big man
N29 1470  8    asked again, taking a step into the boxcar.
N29 1480  2       Ernie hesitated a moment. This character could break
N29 1490  1    him in half. "Sure", he said, and lifted the pint to
N29 1490 12    his own lips. He guzzled down three-quarters of the
N29 1500  8    strong home-blend and proffered the remainder. The
N29 1510  4    man stalked toward them, his big boots heavy on the
N29 1520  3    wooden flooring. He took the bottle with undue belligerence,
N29 1530  1    and making sucking noises with his thick lips, drained
N29 1530 10    it completely.
N29 1540  1       He threw his head back, closed his eyes, and belched
N29 1540 11    ferociously. He belched again, and opening his eyes,
N29 1550  8    threw the bottle out the open door.
N29 1560  3       "Well, now", he said, and reached into his pocket.
N29 1570  1    "I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car".
N29 1580  1       "We're going to Philadelphia", Kitty said, pulling
N29 1580  8    her skirt down around her legs all the more.
N29 1590  8       "No, I don't think so", said the big man, and it
N29 1600  8    was the final clincher for Ernie. He had suspected
N29 1610  3    this guy was trouble, and now he was sure of it.
N29 1620  1       "Maybe you and me will, girlie, but these two ain't
N29 1620 11    goin' nowhere".
N29 1630  1       He advanced on them, and abruptly there was a shocked
N29 1640  1    electricity in the car. Ernie was screaming inside
N29 1640  9    himself: No, damn you, you ain't gonna take my meal
N29 1650  9    ticket away from me!
N29 1660  1       The newcomer stalked toward them, and Kitty shied
N29 1660  9    back, her hand to her mouth. Her scream split up the
N29 1670  9    silence of the car, accompanied by the rattling of
N29 1680  5    the freight, and then Cappy came off the floor, his
N29 1690  2    legs driving him hard. The kid hit the bigger man with
N29 1690 13    an audible thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's
N29 1700  9    tackle. They went down in a heap and for a long minute
N29 1710 11    there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs.
N29 1720  5       The kid showed for an instant, and his arm was cocked
N29 1730  4    back. The fist went down into the pile of flesh, and
N29 1740  1    Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go, "Aaawww"!
N29 1740 10       Then they were tumbling again, and the big man reached
N29 1750 11    into the same pocket he had gone for earlier, and came
N29 1760 10    up with a vicious switchblade.
N29 1770  1       He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough
N29 1780  1    to press the stud. The blade came out with a snick!
N29 1780 12    He fisted the knife overhand, and drew back to plunge
N29 1790  9    it into the kid's throat.
N29 1800  1       Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white.
N29 1800  9    She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked, "Help
N29 1810  7    him! Help him! Do something"!
