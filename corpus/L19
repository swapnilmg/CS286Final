L19 0010  1       slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the
L19 0010 10    boat was moving at little more than a crawl, and watched
L19 0020  8    Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another, tune
L19 0030  5    in the null, then draw in a line on the chart. "We're
L19 0040  2    out just a little too far. Make a 90 degree straight
L19 0050  1    for shore".
L19 0050  3       Poet came in, raising his eyebrows appreciatively
L19 0060  1    as he saw Elaine. "Now"? he asked.
L19 0060  8       "Pretty quick", she replied. "Will you drop the
L19 0070  7    anchor"?
L19 0070  8       Poet nodded, swung below and a moment later emerged
L19 0080  8    from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor.
L19 0090  6    The rock and roll music coming from the radio station
L19 0100  2    suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on
L19 0100 12    the RDF.
L19 0110  1       "Reverse", Elaine said, then peered through the
L19 0110  8    loop of the RDF and waved to Poet. A second later
L19 0120 11    she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor
L19 0130  8    line until it was set in the ocean floor. She cut the
L19 0140  5    engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the
L19 0150  2    end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the
L19 0150 13    wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore. Nick watched
L19 0160  8    her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines,
L19 0170  6    and started the auxiliary motor.
L19 0180  1       Poet came up from below, wearing new bathing trunks.
L19 0180 10    The price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off
L19 0190 11    as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously.
L19 0200  6    Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them, but he said
L19 0210  4    nothing. Nobody, he suddenly realized, was saying anything.
L19 0220  1    It seemed as if they were all under a spell. There
L19 0220 12    should be an excited conversation, for somewhere, directly
L19 0230  6    below them, was a treasure lost for more than four
L19 0240  6    hundred years.
L19 0240  8       But instead of chatter there was a null, like on
L19 0250  7    the radio direction finder. Once, in New York, he had
L19 0260  4    gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane
L19 0270  1    with a single engine. They had all been laughing, joking,
L19 0270 11    when suddenly the engine had failed. No one had screamed.
L19 0280 10    No one had prayed. All had fallen into a complete silence,
L19 0290  8    listening to the wind whistle over the wings. The pilot
L19 0300  6    had been good. He'd landed the plane on a small airstrip
L19 0310  5    in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted
L19 0320  2    to a stop, everyone had burst into chatter at the same
L19 0320 13    moment.
L19 0330  1       There had been tension in the plane during the silent
L19 0330 11    descent; a tension similar to the one now. But in the
L19 0340 11    plane there was a concrete reason for it. Now, at this
L19 0350  7    moment, there should be none ... unless skin diving
L19 0360  3    was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe.
L19 0370  1    Yet tension existed. The same taut-nerved relationship
L19 0370  9    as there had been between the passengers on the plane
L19 0380  9    now strained at the three of them here on the boat.
L19 0390  7    It hung over them like a cloud, its arrival as sudden
L19 0400  3    as a cloud skidding over the sun.
L19 0400 10       Silently, Elaine picked up her keys from the table
L19 0410  8    and went out into the cockpit, Poet behind her, Nick
L19 0420  4    trailing behind him. She threw back a cushion over
L19 0430  1    one of the seats, unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath
L19 0430 12    it, then presently straightened, holding a long knife
L19 0440  7    and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand.
L19 0450  5       Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun. "Hydraulic"?
L19 0460  2    he asked.
L19 0460  4       Elaine nodded. "They are the best". She kicked the
L19 0470  5    locker lid shut and replaced the cushion. "They are
L19 0480  3    the most efficient".
L19 0480  6       "And the deadliest", Poet commented as he buckled
L19 0490  5    on his tank harness.
L19 0490  9       "Why do you need an arsenal"? Nick asked, apprehensively,
L19 0500  7    staring at the weapon.
L19 0510  1       "It's quite possible there's more than codfish down
L19 0520  1    there, man", Poet replied with a short, nervous laugh
L19 0520 10    as he held the harness for Elaine.
L19 0530  5       A moment later, moving awkwardly because of the
L19 0540  3    swimming fins, she picked up the gun, handed the knife
L19 0540 13    to Poet, then rolled off the transom of the boat, back
L19 0550 10    first. Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in
L19 0560  8    a similar fashion. Another moment and they were out
L19 0570  5    of sight, leaving behind only a string of bubbles as
L19 0580  1    a clue to their whereabouts.
L19 0580  6       For a while Nick followed the twisting course of
L19 0590  4    the bubbles, wondering which set came from Elaine.
L19 0600  1    They remained close together, their air trail wiggling
L19 0600  9    like serpents traveling side by side. Eventually the
L19 0610  7    bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface,
L19 0620  5    and he rolled over on his back.
L19 0620 12       Clasping his hands behind his head, he stared at
L19 0630  9    the blue sky. There was nothing quite like being alone
L19 0640  6    on a boat on the ocean. Alfredo certainly must have
L19 0650  3    enjoyed being alone. Next to the ocean, probably the
L19 0660  1    loneliest spot was the desert. If Elaine's uncle had
L19 0660 10    stuck to this desire for aloneness, he probably would
L19 0670  7    still be alive.
L19 0670 10       Yet Alfredo wanted money ... wanted money to roam
L19 0680  8    through the deserts. And Graham wanted money probably
L19 0690  5    to roam among the dice tables in Las Vegas. It was
L19 0700  4    an odd combination ... a strange pair to stumble upon
L19 0710  1    the wreck of the Trinidad. But Graham hadn't stumbled
L19 0710 10    on it. Two to three weeks prior to the charter of the
L19 0720 11    Virginia, Graham had been snooping around the San Luis
L19 0730  8    Rey Mission.
L19 0730 10       The small helicopter with its two steel skids churned
L19 0740  8    offshore and Nick raised up to watch it heading south.
L19 0750  7    That was a hell of a note, he thought. A couple couldn't
L19 0760  4    even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck
L19 0770  3    nowadays without someone swooping down upon them. If
L19 0770 11    the character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente
L19 0780  9    Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful.
L19 0790  7       Off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat
L19 0800  3    its way into the wind, headed on a tack toward San
L19 0810  1    Clemente. Behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways
L19 0810  9    in the small ground-swell, a lone fisherman in the
L19 0820  8    chair aft. The fisherman was right in the middle of
L19 0830  5    the Deep. Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing
L19 0840  2    spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla
L19 0840 11    Deep and the Redondo Deep, two spots where the ocean
L19 0850 10    dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline.
L19 0860  6       Someday, geologists had warned, the land on both
L19 0870  7    sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and
L19 0880  3    no more La Jolla or Redondo Beach. Meanwhile, fishermen
L19 0890  1    took advantage of them to pull up whoppers. Sometimes
L19 0890 10    the fish exploded as they neared the surface because
L19 0900  7    of the difference in pressure.
L19 0910  1       Why, he wondered, had Elaine wanted him along on
L19 0910 10    this trip? He couldn't skindive, he couldn't run a
L19 0920  8    boat, except on the open sea. He stood up, stretched,
L19 0930  6    looked around for the bubbles, but could see none.
L19 0940  3    Strolling down to the galley, he lit the butane under
L19 0940 13    the coffee pot and when the brew was heated, poured
L19 0950 10    himself a cup and went up to the chartroom. Turning
L19 0960  6    on the hi-fi, he went back to the cockpit, stretched
L19 0970  2    out on the cushions and listened to the music.
L19 0980  1       Elaine and Poet returned together, popping up over
L19 0980  8    the transom almost like dolphins breaking water.
L19 0990  5       He sat up and watched as they pulled themselves
L19 1000  2    over the stern. "Any luck"? he asked.
L19 1010  1       Poet shook his head, sliding his face mask up on
L19 1010 10    his forehead.
L19 1020  1       "We're right on the edge of the Deep", Elaine said.
L19 1020 11    Pulling off her face mask, she carefully placed the
L19 1030  9    spear gun across the stern, then lifted her wet hair
L19 1040  6    from her back and squeezed out the water. "Which is
L19 1050  2    a break as the area to search is less than a square
L19 1050 14    mile", she added as she swung her legs over the transom.
L19 1060 11    "Any news"?
L19 1070  1       "Not a thing". He tossed her a towel, then repeated
L19 1070 11    the service for Poet. "Cigarette"?
L19 1080  5       Elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her
L19 1090  7    harness, but Poet nodded. His feet still hung over
L19 1100  2    the stern of the transom, but as he reached for the
L19 1100 13    smoke he raised them to swing them in. The fin on his
L19 1110 11    foot caught on the moulding, throwing him off balance.
L19 1120  5    His forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard
L19 1130  3    and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with
L19 1140  1    his other hand and rolled into the boat.
L19 1140  9       "Kee-reist"! The word hissed distinctly from Poet's
L19 1150  6    lips as he struggled to his feet.
L19 1160  1       Nick's body became rigid. Turning slowly he saw
L19 1160  9    Poet in a brilliant glare of horror. Poet! His face
L19 1170 10    was still creased in pain as he studied the underside
L19 1180  7    of his arm. Poet a murderer? Turning quickly toward
L19 1190  3    Elaine, Nick saw that she, too, stood in shocked surprise.
L19 1200  2       The sudden silence was too silent. Instinctively
L19 1210  1    aware of the charged atmosphere, Poet raised his head
L19 1210 10    slowly, looking first at Elaine.
L19 1220  4       She had caught the implication of the oath. Her
L19 1230  2    face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin, her body
L19 1230 13    absolutely motionless.
L19 1240  2       And then Nick knew that all of them knew ... Elaine,
L19 1250  1    himself ... and Poet.
L19 1250  5       Elaine recovered first, so quickly that Nick thought
L19 1260  4    he might have imagined her sudden reaction. "Do you
L19 1270  2    need a bandage"? she asked steadily.
L19 1270  8       Poet rubbed his arm. "It's like banging a shin",
L19 1280  8    he said, his eyes lingered on Nick's face, then moved
L19 1290  6    back to Elaine. "Hurts like hell for a second, then
L19 1300  4    it disappears".
L19 1300  6       "I'll get some ointment". Elaine turned and started
L19 1310  5    toward the companionway. But her walk was too steady,
L19 1320  4    too slow, telegraphing her fear.
L19 1320  9       Nick sensed it. So did Poet. Springing like a cat,
L19 1330  9    he leaped back, swooped up the spring gun and, whirling,
L19 1340  5    pointed it toward the cabin. At the same instant, Nick
L19 1350  3    hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man.
L19 1360  1    The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh
L19 1360 12    like the first stroke of an old steam engine. At the
L19 1370  8    same instant, Elaine screamed wildly, the sound ending
L19 1380  4    abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the water
L19 1390  2    on top of the frantic, struggling Poet.
L19 1390  9       The moment the sea closed over Nick, some atavistic
L19 1400  7    sense warned him that he would survive in this alien
L19 1410  5    element only if he did not panic. But the murderer
L19 1420  1    to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage. The wide
L19 1420 11    flippers on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power,
L19 1430  9    driving the two of them down into the water as they
L19 1440  7    rolled over and over. Poet was the captured, arms pinioned
L19 1450  3    to his side, and he twisted convulsively trying to
L19 1460  2    escape. Poet would escape, Nick thought grimly, because
L19 1460 10    he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under
L19 1470  8    water. But Nick would not let go.
L19 1480  4       The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's
L19 1490  1    forehead, bounced painlessly off Nick's chin, then
L19 1490  8    disappeared. Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles
L19 1500  7    scraped on the air tank, ripping off the skin. For
L19 1510  5    a split second, Nick relaxed his grip and Poet's slippery
L19 1520  2    body spun completely around before Nick could stop
L19 1530  1    him, holding him now from the rear. Something flailed
L19 1530 10    at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and
L19 1540  8    around.
L19 1540  9       Suddenly Poet stopped struggling and the two of
L19 1550  7    them hung suspended in the water, not rising, not sinking.
L19 1560  5    A sharp pain lanced across Nick's chest and a bubble
L19 1570  3    of air escaped from his tortured lungs, joining dozens
L19 1570 12    of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like
L19 1580  9    helium balloons rising into the sky. A black, snake-like
L19 1590  8    object swayed eerily in front of him, spewing bubbles
L19 1600  4    from its flat cobra head. The air hose was free! The
L19 1610  2    discovery struck Nick like a blow.
L19 1610  8       Desperately, Nick flashed one hand up, catching
L19 1620  6    Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow. At the same instant,
L19 1630  5    he grabbed the loose, writhing hose with his other
L19 1640  2    hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece. Instinctively
L19 1650  1    he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air
L19 1650 11    from the hose. At once the excruciating pain in his
L19 1660  7    chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden, wild
L19 1670  4    exultation.
L19 1670  5       As if this was a signal, Poet abruptly began to
L19 1680  3    thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made
L19 1680 12    them sink through the water. Relentlessly, Nick held
L19 1690  8    on, sucking on the hose, inhaling the air that belonged
L19 1700  7    to Poet. Poet was not fighting Nick now.
