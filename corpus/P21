P21 0010  1       TWO LETTERS HAD ARRIVED FOR MISS THERESA STUBBLEFIELD:
P21 0010  9    SHE PUT them in her bag. She would not stop to read
P21 0020 12    them in American Express, as many were doing, sitting
P21 0030  7    on benches or leaning against the walls, but pushed
P21 0040  4    her way out into the street. This was her first day
P21 0050  2    in Rome and it was June.
P21 0050  8       An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched
P21 0060  3    overhead. In her mind's eye- her imagination responding
P21 0070  1    fully, almost exhaustingly, to these shores' peculiar
P21 0070  8    powers of stimulation- she saw the city as from above,
P21 0080 10    telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins
P21 0090  7    marked, aqueducts and tombs, here a cypress, there
P21 0100  2    a pine, and all around the low blue hills. Pictures
P21 0100 12    in old Latin books returned to her: the Appian Way
P21 0110 10    Today, the Colosseum, the Arch of Constantine. She
P21 0120  6    would see them, looking just as they had in the books,
P21 0130  6    and this would make up a part of her delight. Moreover,
P21 0140  2    nursing various Stubblefields- her aunt, then her mother,
P21 0150  1    then her father- through their lengthy illnesses (everybody
P21 0150  9    could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick),
P21 0160  8    Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot. England,
P21 0170  7    France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy had all been
P21 0180  5    rendered for her time and again, and between the prescribed
P21 0190  2    hours of pills and tonics, she had conceived a dreamy
P21 0190 12    passion by lamplight, to see all these places with
P21 0200  9    her own eyes. The very night after her father's funeral
P21 0210  6    she had thought, though never admitted to a soul: Now
P21 0220  5    I can go. There's nothing to stop me now. So here it
P21 0230  4    was, here was Italy, anyway, and terribly noisy.
P21 0240  1       In the street the traffic was really frightening.
P21 0240  8    Cars, taxis, buses, and motorscooters all went plunging
P21 0250  6    at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously
P21 0260  6    around a fountain. Shoals of tourists went by her in
P21 0270  4    national groups- English school girls in blue uniforms,
P21 0280  1    German boys with cameras attached, smartly dressed
P21 0280  8    Americans looking in shop windows. Glad to be alone,
P21 0290  8    Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that
P21 0300  3    opened to her left. The Spanish Steps.
P21 0310  1       Something special was going on here just now- the
P21 0310  9    annual display of azalea plants. She had heard about
P21 0320  7    it the night before at her hotel. It was not yet complete:
P21 0330  6    workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck
P21 0350  3    and placing them in banked rows on the steps above.
P21 0350 13    The azaleas were as large as shrubs, and their myriad
P21 0360  9    blooms, many still tight in the bud, ranged in color
P21 0370  7    from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest
P21 0380  3    pink, along with many white ones too. Marvelous, thought
P21 0390  1    Theresa, climbing in her portly, well-bred way, for
P21 0390 10    she was someone who had learned that if you only move
P21 0400  9    slowly enough you have time to notice everything. In
P21 0410  4    Rome, all over Europe, she intended to move very slowly
P21 0420  2    indeed.
P21 0420  3       Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down.
P21 0430  2    Other people were doing it, too, sitting all along
P21 0430 11    the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above,
P21 0440  7    watching the azaleas mass, or just enjoying the sun.
P21 0450  6    Theresa sat with her letters in her lap, breathing
P21 0460  2    Mediterranean air. The sun warmed her, as it seemed
P21 0460 11    to be warming everything, perhaps even the underside
P21 0470  7    of stones or the chill insides of churches. She loosened
P21 0480  6    her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette. Content ...
P21 0490  3    excited; how could you be both at once? Strange, but
P21 0500  2    she was. Presently, she picked up the first of the
P21 0500 12    letters.
P21 0510  1       A few moments later her hands were trembling and
P21 0510 10    her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay. Of
P21 0520  6    course, one of them would have to go and do this! Poor
P21 0530  7    Cousin Elec, she thought, tears rising to sting in
P21 0540  4    the sun, but why couldn't he have arranged to live
P21 0550  1    through the summer? And how on earth did I ever get
P21 0550 12    this letter anyway?
P21 0560  1       She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had
P21 0570  1    managed to find her. Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written
P21 0570 11    it, in her loose high old lady's script- t's carefully
P21 0580  8    crossed, but l's inclined to wobble like an old car
P21 0590  9    on the downward slope. Cousin Emma had simply put Miss
P21 0600  6    Theresa Stubblefield, Rome, Italy, on the envelope,
P21 0610  4    had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka, Alabama,
P21 0620  1    and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had
P21 0620 12    been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor. No
P21 0630  8    return address whatsoever. Somebody had scrawled American
P21 0640  4    Express, Piazza di Spagna?, across the envelope, and
P21 0650  3    now Theresa had it, all as easily as if she had been
P21 0655  1    the President of the Republic or the Pope. Inside were
P21 0660 10    all the things they thought she ought to know concerning
P21 0670  8    the last illness, death, and burial of Cousin Alexander
P21 0690  5    Carraway.
P21 0690  6       Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec, brother and sister-
P21 0700  5    unmarried, devoted, aging- had lived next door to the
P21 0710  5    Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until
P21 0720  1    the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years
P21 0720  9    ago. Two days before he was taken sick, Cousin Elec
P21 0730 10    was out worrying about what too much rain might do
P21 0740  7    to his sweetpeas, and Cousin Elec had always preserved
P21 0750  3    in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl
P21 0755  1    paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and
P21 0760 10    which he had promised she could have when he died.
P21 0770  7    I'm supposed to care as much now as then, as much here
P21 0780  6    as there, she realized, with a sigh. This letter would
P21 0790  2    have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome, Italy,
P21 0790 13    on it.
P21 0800  2       She refolded the letter, replaced it in its envelope,
P21 0810  1    and turned with relief to one from her brother George.
P21 0810 11       But alas George, when he had written, had only just
P21 0820  9    returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral.
P21 0830  7    He was full of heavy family reminiscence. All the fine
P21 0840  5    old stock was dying out, look at the world today. His
P21 0850  3    own children had suffered from the weakening of those
P21 0860  1    values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted,
P21 0860 11    and as for his grandchildren (he had one so far, still
P21 0870  9    in diapers), he shuddered to think that the true meaning
P21 0880  7    of character might never dawn on them at all. A life
P21 0890  5    of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had
P21 0890 14    lived had to be known at first hand ...
P21 0900  9       Poor George! The only boy, the family darling. Together
P21 0910  6    with her mother, both of them tense with worry lest
P21 0920  4    things should somehow go wrong. Theresa had seen him
P21 0930  2    through the right college, into the right fraternity,
P21 0930 10    and though pursued by various girls and various mammas
P21 0940  8    of girls, safely married to the right sort, however
P21 0950  5    much in the early years of that match his wife, Anne,
P21 0960  2    had not seemed to understand poor George. Could it
P21 0960 11    just be, Theresa wondered, that Anne had understood
P21 0970  7    only too well, and that George all along was extraordinary
P21 0980  6    only in the degree to which he was dull?
P21 0990  2       As for Cousin Alexander Carraway, the only thing
P21 1000  1    Theresa could remember at the moment about him (except
P21 1000 10    his paper knife) was that he had had exceptionally
P21 1010  7    long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock
P21 1020  4    in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been
P21 1030  2    aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call- first
P21 1030 12    Papa, then Mother, then Theresa and George. There they
P21 1040  9    all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp
P21 1050  9    out of his foot. He had hobbled downstairs into the
P21 1060  5    parlor, in his agony, and was sitting, wrapped in his
P21 1070  3    bathrobe, on a footstool. He held his long clenched
P21 1070 12    foot in both hands, and this and his contorted face-
P21 1080 10    he was trying heroically not to cry out- made him look
P21 1090  8    like a large skinny old monkey. They all surrounded
P21 1100  3    him, the family circle, Theresa and George as solemn
P21 1110  1    as if they were watching the cat have kittens, and
P21 1110 11    Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of
P21 1120  9    hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled
P21 1130  5    pan. "Can you think of anything to do"? she kept repeating.
P21 1140  4    "I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll
P21 1150  3    just have to! Can you think of anything to do"? "You
P21 1160  2    might treat it like the hiccups", said Papa. "Drop
P21 1160 11    a cold key down his back". "I just hope this happens
P21 1170 10    to you someday", said Cousin Elec, who was not at his
P21 1180  9    best. "Poor Cousin Elec", George said. He was younger
P21 1190  6    than Theresa: she remembered looking down and seeing
P21 1200  4    his great round eyes, while at the same time she was
P21 1210  1    dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused.
P21 1210 11    "Poor Cousin Elec".
P21 1220  3       Now, here they both were, still the same, George
P21 1230  1    full of round-eyed woe, and Cousin Emma in despair.
P21 1230 11    Theresa shifted to a new page.
P21 1240  5       "Of course (George's letter continued), there are
P21 1250  3    practical problems to be considered. Cousin Emma is
P21 1250 11    alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting
P21 1260 11    from it. Robbie and Beryl tried their best to persuade
P21 1270  8    her to come and stay with them, and Anne and I have
P21 1280  6    told her she's more than welcome here, but I think
P21 1290  3    she feels that she might be an imposition, especially
P21 1290 12    as long as our Rosie is still in high school. The other
P21 1300 11    possibility is to make arrangements for her to let
P21 1310  7    out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good
P21 1320  3    family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka
P21 1330  1    is populated with- Miss Edna Whittaker, for example.
P21 1330  9    But there is more in this than meets the eye. A new
P21 1340 11    bathroom would certainly have to be put in. The wallpaper
P21 1350  8    in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off ...".
P21 1360  3    (Theresa skipped a page of details about the house.)
P21 1370  1    "I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you
P21 1370 12    will write me about them. I may settle on some makeshift
P21 1380 10    arrangements for the summer and wait until you return
P21 1390  6    in the fall so we can work out together the best ...".
P21 1400  4       I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early
P21 1410  3    in the day, thought Theresa, it always makes me sick.
P21 1410 13    I'll start sneezing in a minute, sitting on these cold
P21 1420 10    steps. She got up, standing uncertainly for a moment,
P21 1430  7    then moving aside to let go past her, talking, a group
P21 1440  5    of young men. They wore shoes with pointed toes, odd
P21 1450  2    to American eyes, and narrow trousers, and their hair
P21 1450 11    looked unnaturally black and slick. Yet here they were
P21 1460  9    obviously thought to be handsome, and felt themselves
P21 1470  6    to be so. Just then a man approached her with a tray
P21 1480  5    of cheap cameos, Parker fountain pens, rosaries, papal
P21 1490  1    portraits. "No", said Theresa. "No, no"! she said.
P21 1490  9    The man did not wish to leave. He knew how to spread
P21 1500 12    himself against the borders of the space that had to
P21 1510  8    separate them. Carrozza rides in the park, the Colosseum
P21 1520  5    by moonlight, he specialized ... Theresa turned away
P21 1530  2    to escape, and climbed to a higher landing where the
P21 1530 12    steps divided in two. There she walked to the far left
P21 1540 11    and leaned on a vacant section of banister, while the
P21 1550  6    vendor picked himself another well-dressed American
P21 1560  2    lady, carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag,
P21 1570  1    ascending the steps alone. Was he ever successful,
P21 1570  9    Theresa wondered. The lady with the alligator bag registered
P21 1580  8    interest, doubt, then indignation; at last, alarm.
P21 1590  4    She cast about as though looking for a policeman: this
P21 1600  2    really shouldn't be allowed! Finally, she scurried
P21 1610  1    away up the steps.
P21 1610  5       Theresa Stubblefield, still holding the family letters
P21 1620  3    in one hand, realized that her whole trip to Europe
P21 1620 13    was viewed in family circles as an interlude between
P21 1630  9    Cousin Elec's death and "doing something" about Cousin
P21 1640  7    Emma. They were even, Anne and George, probably thinking
P21 1650  6    themselves very considerate in not hinting that she
P21 1660  4    really should cut out "one or two countries" and come
P21 1670  3    home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before
P21 1670 13    the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September. Of course,
P21 1680  9    it wasn't Anne and George's fault that one family crisis
P21 1690  8    seemed to follow another, and weren't they always emphasizing
P21 1700  6    that they really didn't know what they would do without
P21 1710  7    Theresa? The trouble is, Theresa thought, that while
P21 1720  4    everything that happens there is supposed to matter
P21 1730  2    supremely, nothing here is supposed even to exist.
P21 1730 10    They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into
P21 1740 11    the ocean tomorrow. It never registered with them that
P21 1750  6    I had time to real all of Balzac, Dickens, and Stendhal
P21 1760  3    while Papa was dying, not to mention everything in
P21 1770  2    the city library after Mother's operation. It would
P21 1770 10    have been exactly the same to them if I had read through
P21 1780 11    all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore.
P21 1790  4       She arranged the letters carefully, one on top of
P21 1800  4    the other. Then, with a motion so suddenly violent
P21 1800 13    that she amazed herself, she tore them in two.
P21 1810  8       "Signora"?
P21 1820  1       She became aware that two Italian workmen, carrying
P21 1820  9    a large azalea pot, were standing before her and wanted
P21 1830  8    her to move so that they could begin arranging a new
P21 1840  5    row of the display.
P21 1840  9       "Mi diapiace, signora, ma ... insomma ...".
P21 1850  6       "Oh ... put it there"! She indicated a spot a little
P21 1860  7    distance away.
