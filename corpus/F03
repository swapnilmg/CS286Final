F03 0010  1       THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends
F03 0010 11    gaze at you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed
F03 0020  9    in amazement. You explain, "I have the strangest feeling
F03 0030  6    of having lived through this very same event before.
F03 0040  5    I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed this
F03 0050  2    same scene of this particular gathering at some time
F03 0050 11    in the past"!
F03 0060  3       This experience will have happened to many of you.
F03 0070  2       Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "... startling
F03 0070 11    experience which almost every person confesses in daylight,
F03 0080  8    that particular passages of conversation and action
F03 0090  6    have occurred to him in the same order before, whether
F03 0100  4    dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have been
F03 0110  2    with precisely these persons in precisely this room,
F03 0110 10    and heard precisely this dialogue, at some former hour,
F03 0120  8    they know not when".
F03 0130  1       Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that
F03 0130  8    weird feeling as the deja vue (already seen) illusion,
F03 0140  8    just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.
F03 0150  5    In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless
F03 0160  2    investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which
F03 0170  1    all of us grope continually.
F03 0170  6       When a man recognizes a certain experience as the
F03 0180  4    exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance
F03 0185  1    of deja vue, except for the fact that he knows just
F03 0190  9    why the experience seems familiar. Occasionally there
F03 0200  5    are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed aside
F03 0210  6    without confessing an unscientific attitude.
F03 0220  1       One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an
F03 0220 10    event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a
F03 0230 10    previous dream, detailed the ensuing occurrences in
F03 0240  5    advance so accurately that his companion was completely
F03 0250  3    mystified.
F03 0250  4       Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon" of psychical
F03 0260  3    research was altered somewhat when he wondered "...
F03 0270  2    how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of
F03 0270 13    my life film"? The famous author tells us of the strange
F03 0280 10    incident in Something About Myself.
F03 0290  3       One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony
F03 0300  2    in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout
F03 0310  1    man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular
F03 0310 11    pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone, clasping
F03 0320  7    him by the arm, whispered, "I want a word with you,
F03 0330  7    please". At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with
F03 0340  3    awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical
F03 0350  1    details of scene, action and word had occurred to him
F03 0350 11    in a dream six weeks earlier.
F03 0360  3       Freud probably contributed more than anyone else
F03 0370  1    to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize
F03 0370 10    their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts. However,
F03 0380  6    readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that
F03 0390  5    he has solved completely the mystery of dreams, should
F03 0400  3    ponder over the following words in his Interpretation
F03 0410  1    Of Dreams, Chapter I: "... as a matter of fact no
F03 0410 12    such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished
F03 0420 10    in any case, and what is more, every one attempting
F03 0430  8    such solution has found that in most cases there have
F03 0440  6    remained a great many components of the dream the source
F03 0450  3    of which he has been unable to explain ... nor is the
F03 0450 15    discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic
F03 0460 10    power of dreams".
F03 0470  1       Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance,
F03 0480  1    prevision and retrovision. The basic mystery of dreams,
F03 0480  9    which embraces all the others and challenges us from
F03 0490  8    even the most common typical dream, is in the fact
F03 0500  6    that they are original, visual continuities.
F03 0510  1       I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream
F03 0510 10    in which I lived through the horror of the bombing
F03 0515  8    of a little Korean town. I am sure that nothing within
F03 0520  5    me is capable of composing that life-like sequence,
F03 0530  1    so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news
F03 0530 11    pictures I have seen. And when psychology explains
F03 0540  8    glibly, "but the subconscious mind is able to produce
F03 0550  6    it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified
F03 0560  2    that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably
F03 0570  1    as part of the individual mind.
F03 0570  7       Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of
F03 0580  5    dreams as things they have never personally observed,
F03 0590  2    but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright
F03 0590 12    avoidance of routine evidence.
F03 0600  4       The question becomes, "What is a dream"?
F03 0610  3       Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?
F03 0620  1       Every dream, and this is true of a mental image
F03 0620 11    of any type even though it may be readily interpreted
F03 0630  8    into its equivalent of wakeful thought, is a psychic
F03 0640  5    phenomenon for which no explanation is available. In
F03 0650  2    most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals
F03 0650 10    or objects. But these are dreamed in original action,
F03 0660  8    in some particular continuity which we don't remember
F03 0670  5    having seen in real life. For instance, the dreamer
F03 0680  3    sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with
F03 0690  1    photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas,
F03 0690  9    it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car.
F03 0700 11    There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter
F03 0710  7    past impressions to fit into an original, realistic
F03 0720  2    and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.
F03 0720 10       The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical
F03 0730 10    basis of a mental image can find no logical support.
F03 0740  9    A "mental image" subconsciously impressing us from
F03 0750  4    beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought, or
F03 0760  3    consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image
F03 0760 12    at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in
F03 0770 10    the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths
F03 0780  6    of the fourth dimension.
F03 0780 10       Dreams that display events of the future with photographic
F03 0790  9    detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery
F03 0800  8    and all its components, including that weird feeling
F03 0810  4    of deja vue, inevitably fantastic though that theory
F03 0820  3    must seem.
F03 0820  5       As in the theory of perception, established in
F03 0830  2    psycho-physiology,
F03 0830  4    the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain.
F03 0840  4    But then this theory confesses that it is completely
F03 0840 13    at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received
F03 0850 12    by the brain. The opening paragraph of the chapter
F03 0860  6    titled The Theory Of Representative Perception, in
F03 0870  3    the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger
F03 0880  4    says, "... passed on to the brain, and there, by some
F03 0890  3    unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".
F03 0900  1       But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal
F03 0900 10    image within the brain? As retinal images are conceded
F03 0910  9    to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical
F03 0920  8    to suppose that the nerves, between the inner brain
F03 0930  4    and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation
F03 0940  1    from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize
F03 0940 10    on the transmission of an image which is already in
F03 0950  8    required location. Hereby, the external object viewed
F03 0960  5    by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, not the
F03 0970  3    retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve
F03 0970 13    perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses
F03 0980  6    in the other sensory centers, motor tensions, associated
F03 0990  5    word symbols, and consciousness.
F03 1000  1       Modern physics has developed the theory that all
F03 1000  9    matter consists of minute waves of energy. We know
F03 1010  8    that the number of radio and television impulses, sound
F03 1020  4    waves, ultra-violet rays, etc., that may occupy the
F03 1030  2    very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency,
F03 1030 11    is infinite. So we may conceive the coexistence of
F03 1040  8    the infinite number of universal, apparently momentary
F03 1050  3    states of matter, successive one after another in consciousness,
F03 1060  4    but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive
F03 1070  3    frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any
F03 1080  1    event throughout eternity to be continuously available
F03 1080  8    at any moment to consciousness.
F03 1090  2       Space in any form is completely measured by the
F03 1100  1    three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical
F03 1100 10    concept and not purely metaphysical, through what medium
F03 1110  7    does it extend? It is not through space nor time that
F03 1120  7    the time machine most approved by science fiction must
F03 1130  3    travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past,
F03 1140  1    or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds
F03 1140 10    flat is the usual time, and the space is crossed by
F03 1150  9    moderate mileage, while the overwhelming immensity
F03 1160  3    of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation
F03 1170  2    through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies
F03 1170  9    which perpetuate all events.
F03 1180  4       The body, senses and brain, in common with all matter,
F03 1190  3    have their counterpart on each of a countless number
F03 1190 12    of frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear
F03 1200  8    the impression only of phenomena that share its own
F03 1210  7    frequency, whereas those upon all other frequencies
F03 1220  2    are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness
F03 1230  1    is the factor that provides the progressive continuity
F03 1230  9    to sensory impressions. When consciousness deserts
F03 1240  5    the sleeping body and the wakeful world, it continues
F03 1250  5    in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past
F03 1260  2    and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one
F03 1260 14    left when the body tired and required sleep.
F03 1270  8       If the photographically realistic continuity of
F03 1280  4    dreams, however bizarre their combinations, denies
F03 1290  2    that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must
F03 1290 13    be compounded from views of diverse realities, although
F03 1300  7    some of them may never be encountered in what we are
F03 1310  7    pleased to call the real life.
F03 1320  1       Dr. H. V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the
F03 1320  9    University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian
F03 1330  7    priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B.C.)
F03 1340  6    escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple
F03 1350  5    of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about
F03 1360  2    a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its
F03 1360 12    identification. As a matter of fact, the incorrect
F03 1370  8    classification, the result of many weeks of labor by
F03 1380  7    Dr. Hilprecht, was about to be published by him the
F03 1390  4    following day. Some time later the missing part of
F03 1390 13    the relic was found and the complete inscription, together
F03 1400  8    with other new evidence, fully corroborated the ancient
F03 1410  5    priest's information. Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as
F03 1420  5    to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream.
F03 1430  4    He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite,
F03 1440  1    and imagined it must have been German or English.
F03 1440 10       We may conclude that all six points of information,
F03 1450  8    ostensibly given by the dream priest, could have been
F03 1460  6    furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning.
F03 1470  3    But, in denying any physical reality for this dream,
F03 1480  3    how could the brain possibly compose that realistic,
F03 1480 11    vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout,
F03 1490  7    violent break or sudden substitution? Which theory
F03 1500  5    is more fantastic: 1. that the perfect continuity was
F03 1510  4    composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the
F03 1520  3    professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality
F03 1520 13    on the infinite progressions of universal, gradient
F03 1530  6    frequencies, across which the modern professor and
F03 1540  5    the priest of ancient Nippur met?
F03 1550  1       The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory
F03 1550  9    to forgetfulness, determines whether a dream will be
F03 1560  6    a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or the vaguely,
F03 1570  3    effective source of the weird deja vue feeling. No
F03 1580  1    doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave
F03 1580 10    no trace on the sleeper's mind. Probably less than
F03 1590  6    one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration
F03 1600  4    before we wake. When we arrive at the events concerned
F03 1610  2    in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress
F03 1620  1    us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably
F03 1620  9    frequent instances of deja vue, in which our recognition
F03 1630  9    of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived
F03 1640  8    through it before, a feeling which, though vague, withstands
F03 1650  4    the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of
F03 1660  3    psychologists. If deja vue is an illusion, then peculiarly,
F03 1670  1    it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting
F03 1670  9    even the most level-headed people.
F03 1680  4       Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for the Republican
F03 1690  3    Presidential nomination, was attending a convention
F03 1700  1    at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel
F03 1700 10    Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he
F03 1710  8    noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had
F03 1720  7    never met. After the preliminary business affair was
F03 1730  3    finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech
F03 1740  1    that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew
F03 1740  9    had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird
F03 1750  8    feeling of having lived through that identical convention
F03 1760  4    session at some time in the past, he would have been
F03 1770  3    informed that he was a victim of deja vue. But the
F03 1770 14    famous orator felt more than vague recognition for
F03 1780  8    the scene. He remembered exactly when he had lived
F03 1790  6    through it before, and he had something to prove he
F03 1800  4    had.
F03 1800  5       One week before the convention, Depew was seated
F03 1810  2    on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing
F03 1810 13    at the opposite shore.
