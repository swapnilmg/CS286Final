F13 0010  1    _@_
F13 0010  2       Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be
F13 0010 10    arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock.
F13 0020  9       Livestock must be tended every day, routinely. A
F13 0030  6    slight change in the work schedule may cut the production
F13 0040  4    of cows or chickens.
F13 0040  8       Even if there are no livestock, the farmer cannot
F13 0050  5    leave the farm for long periods, particularly during
F13 0060  2    the growing season.
F13 0060  5       The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs
F13 0070  4    readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work in another
F13 0080  3    locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss
F13 0080 14    of capital.
F13 0090  2    _@_
F13 0090  3       Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a
F13 0090 11    part of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and,
F13 0100 11    at times, work late at night. Frequently he must work
F13 0110  7    long hours in the hot sun or cold rain. No matter how
F13 0120  5    well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected setbacks
F13 0130  2    can cause extra work that must be caught up.
F13 0130 11       It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer
F13 0140  9    to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time
F13 0150  5    farmer can invest in profitably.
F13 0150 10    _@_
F13 0150 11       Production may fall far below expectations. Drought,
F13 0160  7    hail, disease, and insects take their toll of crops.
F13 0170  6    Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into
F13 0180  4    the owner's earnings, even into his capital.
F13 0190  1    _@_
F13 0190  1       Returns for money and labor invested may be small
F13 0190 10    even in a good year.
F13 0200  2       The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make
F13 0200 11    it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis.
F13 0210  9    Land within commuting distance of a growing city is
F13 0230  7    usually high in price, higher if it has subdivision
F13 0240  2    possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay
F13 0240  9    higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because
F13 0250  9    they buy in smaller quantities. If the farm is in an
F13 0260  8    industrial area where wages are high, farm labor costs
F13 0270  4    will also be high.
F13 0270  8       A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as
F13 0280  6    high production per hen, per cow, or per acre as can
F13 0290  3    be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will
F13 0290 13    frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most
F13 0300  9    up-to-date equipment. He may have to depend upon custom
F13 0310  7    service for specialized operations, such as spraying
F13 0320  4    or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his
F13 0330  1    turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that
F13 0330 10    arise while he is away at his off-farm job.
F13 0340  8    _@_
F13 0340  9       The farm may be an additional burden if the main
F13 0350  5    job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is owned
F13 0360  2    or rented.
F13 0360  4       If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid. If
F13 0370  2    it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is
F13 0370 14    not free of mortgage, there will be interest and payments
F13 0390  2    on the principal to take care of.
F13 0390  9    _ADVANTAGES_
F13 0400  1       _@_
F13 0400  1       A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment
F13 0400  9    for children. It gives them room to play and plenty
F13 0410  9    of fresh air. The children can do chores adapted to
F13 0420  5    their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig, or
F13 0430  2    some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility
F13 0430 11    for work.
F13 0440  2    _@_
F13 0440  3       Part-time farming gives a measure of security if
F13 0440 12    the regular job is lost, provided the farm is owned
F13 0450 10    free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed
F13 0460  6    expenses and minimum living costs.
F13 0470  1    _@_
F13 0470  2       For some retired persons, part-time farming is a
F13 0470 11    good way to supplement retirement income. It is particularly
F13 0480  8    suitable for those who need to work or exercise out
F13 0490  8    of doors for their health.
F13 0500  1    _@_
F13 0500  1       Generally, the same level of living costs less in
F13 0510  7    the country than in the city. The savings are not as
F13 0520  9    great, however, as is sometime supposed. Usually, the
F13 0530  3    cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the
F13 0540  2    farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat
F13 0540 11    more. Where schools, fire and police protection, and
F13 0550  8    similar municipal services are of equal quality in
F13 0560  6    city and country, real estate taxes are usually about
F13 0570  3    the same.
F13 0570  5    _@_
F13 0570  6       A part-time farmer and his family can use their
F13 0580  3    spare time profitably.
F13 0580  6    _@_
F13 0580  7       Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational.
F13 0590  6    For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change
F13 0600  3    from the regular job, and a physical conditioner.
F13 0600 11    #LAND, LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED#
F13 0610  5    Part-time farming can take comparatively little land,
F13 0620  3    labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends on
F13 0630  2    the kind and the scale of the farming operation.
F13 0630 11       General requirements for land, labor, and equipment
F13 0640  7    are discussed below. Specific requirements for each
F13 0650  4    of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages
F13 0660  3    8 to 14.
F13 0660  6    _LAND_
F13 0660  7       Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough
F13 0670  3    for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and
F13 0670 12    for a small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs.
F13 0680 10    You could not, of course, raise feed for the livestock
F13 0690  6    on a plot this small.
F13 0690 11       If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise
F13 0710  8    on a larger scale, you'll need more land.
F13 0720  4       In deciding how much land you want, take into account
F13 0730  2    the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.
F13 0730 13    But consider also how much you and your family can
F13 0740 10    keep up along with your other work. The cost of land
F13 0750  7    and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence
F13 0760  4    your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more land
F13 0770  2    than they need in anticipation of suburban development.
F13 0770 10    This is a highly speculative venture.
F13 0780  5       Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part
F13 0790  4    of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive
F13 0800  1    to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it
F13 0800 14    than to buy so small an acreage that the development
F13 0810  8    of adjoining properties might impair the residential
F13 0820  4    value of the farm.
F13 0820  8    _LABOR_
F13 0820  9       If you have a year-round, full-time job you can't
F13 0830  8    expect to grow much more than your family uses- unless
F13 0840  4    other members of the family do a good deal of the work
F13 0850  3    or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire
F13 0850 14    little help.
F13 0860  2       In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by
F13 0860 11    family labor, compare the amount of labor that can
F13 0870  8    be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various
F13 0880  6    enterprises listed in table 1.
F13 0890  1       List the number of hours the family can be expected
F13 0890 10    to work each month. You may want to include your own
F13 0900  8    regular vacation period if you have one. Do not include
F13 0910  5    all your spare time or all your family's spare time-
F13 0920  1    only what you are willing to use for farm work.
F13 0930  1    _EQUIPMENT_
F13 0930  1       If you are going to produce for home use only, you
F13 0930 12    will need only hand tools. You will probably want to
F13 0940  8    hire someone to do the plowing, however.
F13 0950  2       For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power
F13 0960  1    for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If
F13 0960  8    you have a planting of half an acre or more you may
F13 0970  9    want to buy a small garden tractor (available for $300
F13 0980  4    to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These tractors
F13 0990  2    are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly
F13 0990  9    on heavier soils, so you may still want to hire someone
F13 1000 10    to do the plowing.
F13 1010  1       Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem
F13 1010 11    to the small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm
F13 1020 10    for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must
F13 1030  7    keep in mind the needed machinery investments when
F13 1040  2    you choose among farm enterprises.
F13 1040  7       You can keep your machinery investment down by buying
F13 1050  6    good secondhand machinery, by sharing the cost and
F13 1060  4    upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring
F13 1070  1    someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive
F13 1070 11    and specialized piece of machinery is needed- such
F13 1080  7    as a spray rig, a combine, or a binder- it is better
F13 1090  7    to pay someone with a machine to do the work.
F13 1100  1    #SELECTING A FARM#
F13 1100  4    Before you look for a farm you'll need to know (1)
F13 1110  4    the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake;
F13 1110 14    and (2) whether you want to buy or rent.
F13 1130  8       Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding
F13 1140  6    on the kind and scale of your farming venture.
F13 1150  1       If you are not well acquainted with the area in
F13 1150 11    which you wish to locate, or if you are not sure that
F13 1160 10    you and your family will like and make a success of
F13 1170  6    farming, usually you would do better to rent a place
F13 1180  3    for a year or two before you buy.
F13 1180 11       Discussed below are some of the main things to look
F13 1190  8    for when you select a part-time farm.
F13 1200  1    _LOCATION_
F13 1200  2       _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_
F13 1200  5       Choose a location within easy commuting distance
F13 1210  3    of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.
F13 1220  1    Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have
F13 1220 10    to sell the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities
F13 1230  9    also will make the place easier to sell if that should
F13 1240 10    become desirable.
F13 1250  1       Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road.
F13 1260  1    _NEARNESS TO MARKETS.-_
F13 1260  1       If you grow anything to sell you will need markets
F13 1260 11    nearby. If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole
F13 1270 10    milk, for example, you should be close to a town or
F13 1280  9    city.
F13 1290  1    _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_
F13 1290  1       Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.
F13 1290 12    There are slums in the country as well as in the city.
F13 1300 10    Few rural areas are protected by zoning. A tavern,
F13 1310  5    filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, or some
F13 1320  3    other business may go up near enough to hurt your home
F13 1320 14    or to hurt its value.
F13 1330  4    _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_
F13 1330  8       Check on the schools in the area, the quality of
F13 1340  7    teaching, and the provision for transportation to and
F13 1350  3    from them.
F13 1350  5       Find out whether fire protection, sewage system,
F13 1360  2    gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available
F13 1360 10    in the locality. If these facilities are not at the
F13 1370  9    door, getting them may cost more than you expect. You
F13 1380  7    may have to provide them yourself or get along without
F13 1390  4    them.
F13 1390  5       You cannot get along without an adequate supply
F13 1400  2    of pure water. If you are considering a part-time farm
F13 1400 13    where the water must be provided by a well, find out
F13 1410 11    if there is a good well on the farm or the probable
F13 1420  7    cost of having one drilled. A pond may provide adequate
F13 1430  3    water for livestock and garden. Pond water can be filtered
F13 1440  1    for human use, but most part-time farmers would not
F13 1440 11    want to go to so much trouble. The following amounts
F13 1450  8    of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic
F13 1460  5    uses.
F13 1460  6    _TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL_
F13 1460  9       Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise?
F13 1470  9    If you can't tell, get help from your county agricultural
F13 1480  6    agent or other local specialist. Soil type, drainage,
F13 1490  4    or degree of slope can make the difference between
F13 1500  1    good crops and poor ones. Small areas that aren't right
F13 1500 11    for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well
F13 1510 10    suited to that crop.
F13 1520  1    _THE HOUSE_
F13 1520  2       Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering
F13 1530  1    make a satisfactory full-time residence? How much will
F13 1530 10    it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?
F13 1540  7    If the house is not wired adequately for electricity
F13 1550  5    or if plumbing or a central heating system must be
F13 1560  4    installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.
F13 1570  1    #BUYING A FARM#
F13 1570  4    The value of the farm to you will depend on-
F13 1580  1    _@_
F13 1580  2       Its worth as a place to live.
F13 1580  9    _@_
F13 1580 10       The value of the products you can raise on it.
F13 1590  8    _@_
F13 1590  9       The possibilities of selling the property later
F13 1600  4    on for suburban subdivision.
F13 1600  8       Decide first what the place is worth to you and
F13 1610  9    your family as a home in comparison with what it would
F13 1620  5    cost to live in town. Take into account the difference
F13 1630  1    in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility
F13 1630  9    rates, and the cost of travel to work.
F13 1640  7       Next, estimate the value of possible earnings of
F13 1650  3    the farm. To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating
F13 1660  1    the farm. List the kind and quantity of things the
F13 1660 11    farm can be expected to produce in an average year.
F13 1670  8    Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices.
F13 1680  4    The total is the probable gross income from farming.
F13 1690  1       To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated
F13 1700  1    annual farming expenditures from probable gross income
F13 1700  8    from farming. Include as expenditures an allowance
F13 1710  5    for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment. Also
F13 1720  4    count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed
F13 1730  2    by the family. It may be hard to decide what this labor
F13 1740  1    is worth, but charge something for it. Otherwise, you
F13 1740 10    may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your
F13 1750  9    labor.
F13 1750 10       To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment
F13 1760  9    income, divide the estimated annual net farm income
F13 1770  5    by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest
F13 1780  3    if the money were invested in some other way.
