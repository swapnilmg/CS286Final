E34 0010  1    In the period since the end of World War II- a period
E34 0015  1    coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful,
E34 0020  7    the unusual, and the original in signs and displays-
E34 0030  5    plastics have come on so strong that today they are
E34 0050  3    the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance
E34 0050 11    of the sign industry to the plastics industry, however,
E34 0060  8    is not in terms of volume alone. Designers of signs
E34 0070  6    and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the
E34 0080  4    adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings
E34 0090  1    of other industries. Many of today's developments in
E34 0090  9    thermoforming stem from original work done with signs
E34 0100  8    and displays; the art of preprinting in distortion
E34 0110  4    was similarly perfected by the sign makers; and the
E34 0130  3    reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for
E34 0130 10    escutcheons, medallions, etc., owes much to the field,
E34 0140  8    as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting
E34 0150  7    properties of the transparent plastics.
E34 0160  2       There is much that many industries can continue
E34 0160 10    to learn from some of the more recent developments
E34 0170  9    described below. The concept of trans-illumination
E34 0180  5    (as shown by the photo on p. 92), as just one example,
E34 0190  3    offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-
E34 0200  3    no matter what industry is involved.
E34 0200  9    #A VOLUME MARKET#
E34 0200 12    According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, plastics
E34 0210  9    units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales.
E34 0220 10    Five years ago, they had only 10% of the market, with
E34 0230  7    the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of
E34 0240  3    neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics.
E34 0250  1    Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the
E34 0250 10    signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction.
E34 0260  8    Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent
E34 0270  9    activities of such leading companies in the field as
E34 0280  5    Advance Neon Sign Co., Los Angeles, Calif. Four years
E34 0290  3    ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon
E34 0300  1    signs; today, 85% is in plastics.
E34 0300  7       From the volume standpoint, the total market represented
E34 0310  5    by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate sales
E34 0320  2    during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently,
E34 0330  1    there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging
E34 0330 10    from small firms with a handful of employees to major
E34 0340  8    concerns having complete facilities for production
E34 0350  3    of metal, electrical, and plastic components.
E34 0360  1    #WHY THE TREND TO PLASTICS?#
E34 0360  5    What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the
E34 0370  5    sign and display field? Out of many factors which might
E34 0380  2    be cited, five are most important:
E34 0380  8    _1._
E34 0380  9       Plastics combine such properties as built-in color,
E34 0390  7    light weight, optional transparency or translucency,
E34 0400  3    resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.
E34 0410  1    _2._
E34 0410  2       Plastic signs are economical. According to one major
E34 0420  2    producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are
E34 0420 10    approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable
E34 0430  8    neon unit. Shipping cost is also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft.
E34 0440  9    plastic sign weighs about 120 lb., compared to 275-300
E34 0450  5    lb. for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater durability
E34 0460  2    of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth
E34 0470  1    in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly
E34 0470 10    supports and mountings are needed. Finally, maintenance
E34 0480  5    costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile
E34 0490  6    neon signs.
E34 0490  8    _3._
E34 0490  9       They offer exceptional design freedom, making it
E34 0500  1    possible to incorporate contours and details which
E34 0510  2    give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum-
E34 0510 13    and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between
E34 0520  7    cardboard and molded plastics. Pre-decoration, low-cost
E34 0530  3    molds, and the freedom to form large and small, thick
E34 0540  4    and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the
E34 0550  1    industry.
E34 0550  2    _4._
E34 0550  3       Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal illumination,
E34 0560  2    protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual
E34 0570  1    appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant
E34 0570  9    colors command attention and interest.
E34 0580  4    _5._
E34 0580  5       Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques
E34 0590  2    give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely
E34 0590 10    wide choice of production techniques, ranging from
E34 0600  7    injection molding for intricate, smaller-size, mass-production
E34 0610  6    signs (generally 5000 units is the minimum) to vacuum
E34 0620  5    and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs.
E34 0630  2    Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display
E34 0630 11    field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding.
E34 0650  1    _WHAT PLASTICS TO USE?_
E34 0650  3       For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its
E34 0650 11    outstanding optical characteristics, weather resistance
E34 0660  5    and formability, strongly dominates the picture. At
E34 0670  5    present, both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer
E34 0680  4    extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers,
E34 0690  1    with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of
E34 0690  9    the total. (See panel, p. 166, for a comparison.)
E34 0700  7       Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's
E34 0710  1    Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer
E34 0720  2    designated as Monocite H 100, which was developed
E34 0730  1    specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets
E34 0730  8    for the sign and lighting industry. Sheeting cast from
E34 0740  6    this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much
E34 0750  6    as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, and
E34 0760  2    will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at
E34 0760 11    low temperatures, resists chipping, cracking, and crazing,
E34 0770  6    according to Du Pont.
E34 0780  1       Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for
E34 0780  8    vacuum-formed signs, background panels, and molded
E34 0790  6    or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness,
E34 0800  3    ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties.
E34 0810  1    Its clarity and good optical properties are other important
E34 0820  1    factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate
E34 0820 11    laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are
E34 0830  8    of different color. Thermoforming the laminate and
E34 0840  4    then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical
E34 0850  1    way to produce a two-color sign. (see MPl, Mar. 1961,
E34 0860  1    p. 98).
E34 0870  2       For specialized types of displays, such as large
E34 0870 10    three-dimensional units reproducing a product, package,
E34 0880  6    human or animal figures, etc., reinforced plastics
E34 0890  4    and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other
E34 0900  3    materials frequently used.
E34 0900  6       A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester
E34 0910  6    film, now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated
E34 0920  4    signs (see below).
E34 0920  7       For outdoor signs and displays, where the problem
E34 0930  5    of weathering resistance is no longer a factor, the
E34 0940  3    choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be
E34 0940 12    found regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate,
E34 0950  7    cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate, acrylic,
E34 0960  4    vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene. The
E34 0970  2    final choice of material depends upon such factors
E34 0970 10    as costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity,
E34 0980  8    number of units required, time available for tooling,
E34 0990  6    and projected life expectancy of the unit. Often, the
E34 1000  5    finished sign or display incorporates several types
E34 1010  1    of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.
E34 1010  9    #TRANS-ILLUMINATED BILLBOARDS#
E34 1020  2    One of the most significant advancements in design
E34 1030  1    of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated
E34 1030 10    billboard, now being produced by several large sign
E34 1040  7    manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co., Los Angeles,
E34 1050  6    and Industrial Electric Inc., New Orleans, La.
E34 1060  4       The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated
E34 1070  3    boards and existing billboards is that the former,
E34 1080  1    constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted
E34 1080  8    from within. With the source of light behind the copy,
E34 1090  9    there is no loss of lumen output, as with conventional
E34 1100  4    boards illuminated by means of reflected light. Also,
E34 1110  2    the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather
E34 1110 11    exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.
E34 1120  9       The copy itself, including any text or illustrations,
E34 1130  6    is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar
E34 1140  5    polyester film by a photo screen process. The film
E34 1150  2    has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be
E34 1150 13    stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign,
E34 1160  7    and also to be stripped off for replacement by new
E34 1170  4    copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify
E34 1180  1    the change from one copy or message to another; new
E34 1180 11    panels are exchanged for the old right in the field
E34 1190  8    on a single trip. Panels with outdated copy are returned
E34 1200  5    to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.
E34 1210  1       Signs of this type have already made their appearance
E34 1220  1    in several larger cities, and others are on the way.
E34 1220 11    It is believed that these boards will, within the next
E34 1230  7    few years, replace many of the conventional flood-lighted
E34 1240  4    boards now in use.
E34 1240  8       Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in
E34 1250  6    other directions. As used by Industrial Electric Inc.,
E34 1260  3    the film panels are printed one at a time, as are 24-sheet
E34 1270  4    posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted
E34 1270 14    translucent plastics faces; they can also be applied
E34 1280  8    to opaque panels for use on cutouts, or they can be
E34 1290  9    applied directly to painted bulletin faces. In this
E34 1300  4    way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying
E34 1310  1    uniform copy on different sign media.
E34 1310  7       Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new
E34 1320  5    development made possible by modern plastic materials-
E34 1330  3    a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16 triangular
E34 1340  2    trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible
E34 1340 10    to combine three different signs in a single unit.
E34 1350  9    The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which
E34 1360  6    permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject.
E34 1370  4    Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide,
E34 1380  2    make up the 25-ft. length of the sign.
E34 1380 11    #CHANGEABLE LETTERS FILL MANY NEEDS#
E34 1390  4    Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of
E34 1400  2    design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs
E34 1400 11    and displays would be to look at what is happening
E34 1410  9    in only one of the areas in this complex field- changeable
E34 1420  4    signs.
E34 1420  5       Signs are meant to convey a message, and in most
E34 1430  6    cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently,
E34 1440  1    the message must be changed at intervals to feature
E34 1440 10    new products, price changes, etc. The huge market
E34 1450  7    for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand
E34 1460  4    for individual plastic letters, in all shapes and sizes-
E34 1470  3    and a number of companies are set up to supply them.
E34 1470 14    Here are some of the newer items currently available:
E34 1480  9       Poster Products Inc., Chicago, Ill.: a changeable
E34 1490  6    copy and display sign which consists of an extruded
E34 1500  6    impact styrene background in choice of colors, onto
E34 1510  3    which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words
E34 1510 12    screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock.
E34 1520  9    The background, which is available in various widths
E34 1530  4    and continuous lengths, is extruded with parallel undercut
E34 1540  3    grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.
E34 1550  1       The Adaptaplex Co., Beaverton, Ore.; letters molded
E34 1560  1    of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red
E34 1560 10    or black. Ideal for merchandising use, they are
E34 1570  6    weather-resistant,
E34 1570  8    and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings
E34 1580  9    in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel.
E34 1590  3       For large letters, e.g. thermoformed of acrylic
E34 1600  3    or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example,
E34 1610  1    in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in. and six
E34 1610 11    36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white
E34 1620  8    painted wood background. The fact that even the larger
E34 1630  7    letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to
E34 1640  4    secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic
E34 1650  1    angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel
E34 1650  9    screws were used to minimize corrosion stains. For
E34 1660  7    mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds, very small
E34 1670  4    holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and
E34 1680  2    stainless steel wire threaded through the openings,
E34 1680  9    its ends twisted behind the panels.
E34 1690  5       Large injection-molded letters are also available
E34 1700  3    for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc., Chicago,
E34 1710  2    for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights
E34 1710 11    of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a
E34 1720 13    special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate.
E34 1730  5    Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars,
E34 1740  6    extruded of transparent acrylic material, which may
E34 1750  3    be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.
E34 1760  1    Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft., the bars are shaped
E34 1760 13    in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered
E34 1770 10    slots molded in back of the letters.
E34 1780  4       Still another approach to the changeable letter
E34 1790  1    type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt
E34 1790 11    Products, Azusa, Calif. This vacuum formed sign is
E34 1800  7    comprised of 27-in. (or smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in.
E34 1810  7    clear butyrate sheet stock, masked and sprayed on the
E34 1820  5    rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding the
E34 1830  2    separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum,
E34 1840  1    which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets
E34 1840 10    are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties
E34 1850  6    Co., Los Angeles, Calif.
E34 1860  1       On large-area units, where additional structural
E34 1860  8    requirements are imposed, one recent approach utilizes
E34 1870  7    modular extruded or formed channels (e.g. right-angled
E34 1880  5    corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate. Joined side
E34 1890  3    by side, such channels make possible construction of
E34 1900  2    continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50
E34 1900 10    ft. high and of unlimited width. Letters may be wired
E34 1910  8    to the face of the combined channels, painted on the
E34 1920  5    first surface, or handled in other ways.
