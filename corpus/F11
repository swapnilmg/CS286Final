F11 0010  1       TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable
F11 0010  9    and quarrelsome for almost a year. His grades had gone
F11 0020  9    steadily downhill, and he had stopped bringing friends
F11 0040  2    and classmates home from school.
F11 0050  1       Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned.
F11 0050  9    Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door,
F11 0060  7    let the cat out of the bag. The youngsters in the boys'
F11 0070  7    class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs Bunny" because his teeth
F11 0080  5    protruded.
F11 0080  6       When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take
F11 0090  7    him to an orthodontist- a dentist who specializes in
F11 0100  3    realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.
F11 0110  1    During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly
F11 0120  1    with the dentist and was delighted with the final result
F11 0120 11    achieved- an upper row of strong straight teeth that
F11 0130 11    completely changed his facial appearance.
F11 0140  3       Richard Stewart is no special case. "The majority
F11 0150  2    of children in the United States could benefit by some
F11 0150 12    form of orthodontic treatment", says Dr. Allan G. Brodie,
F11 0160  9    professor and head of the department of orthodontics
F11 0170  8    at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized
F11 0180  6    authority in his field.
F11 0190  1       What do parents need to know about those "years
F11 0190 10    of the braces" in order not to waste a child's time
F11 0200  8    and their money? How can they tell whether a child
F11 0210  5    needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should
F11 0220  1    tooth-straightening
F11 0220  3    be undertaken? What is it likely to cost?
F11 0230  1    #TOOTH FIT EXPLAINED#
F11 0230  4    OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression for the way teeth
F11 0240  5    fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion,
F11 0250  1    or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for.
F11 0250 13    One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a
F11 0260  7    receding chin and protruding upper front teeth. A chin
F11 0270  5    too prominent in relation to the rest of the face,
F11 0280  2    a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped
F11 0280 12    lower jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate
F11 0290  8    the opposite type of malocclusion.
F11 0300  3       These two basic malformations have, of course, many
F11 0310  2    variations. A child probably requires some form of
F11 0310 10    treatment if he has any of the following conditions:
F11 0320  9    _@_
F11 0320 10       A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw.
F11 0330  8    _@_
F11 0330  9       Crooked, overlapping, twisted, or widely spaced
F11 0340  5    teeth.
F11 0340  6    _@_
F11 0340  7       Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close.
F11 0350  6    _@_
F11 0350  7       Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when
F11 0360  4    the back teeth close.
F11 0360  8    _@_
F11 0360  9       The eyeteeth (third from the middle on top, counting
F11 0370  6    each front tooth as the first) beginning to protrude
F11 0380  3    like fangs.
F11 0380  5    _@_
F11 0380  6       Second teeth that have come in before the first
F11 0390  3    ones have fallen out, making a double row.
F11 0390 11       Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago,
F11 0400 10    when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate
F11 0410  5    habit, recent studies show that most tooth irregularity
F11 0420  2    has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.
F11 0430  1    However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or
F11 0430 11    jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in
F11 0440  7    his family.
F11 0440  9       Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb-
F11 0450  9    or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting, or lip-sucking-
F11 0460  4    but it's important to remember that there's a difference
F11 0470  4    between normal and excessive sucking habits. It's perfectly
F11 0480  4    normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and no mother
F11 0490  3    need worry if a child continues this habit until he
F11 0490 13    is two or three years old. Occasional sucking up to
F11 0500  9    the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth;
F11 0510  4    but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent,
F11 0520  3    it will have an effect.
F11 0520  8       Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost
F11 0530  7    too soon or retained too long. If a child loses a molar
F11 0540  4    at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward
F11 0550  1    the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended
F11 0550  9    for the permanent ones and producing a jumble. If baby
F11 0560  8    teeth are retained too long, the incoming second teeth
F11 0570  4    may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or
F11 0580  3    may have to erupt in the wrong place.
F11 0580 11    #CORRECTION CAN SAVE TEETH#
F11 0590  1    EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed
F11 0590  8    by their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely
F11 0600  8    smile, or they try to speak with the mouth closed.
F11 0610  7    In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's, a child's personality
F11 0620  4    is affected. Yet from the dentist's point of view,
F11 0630  4    bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical
F11 0630 12    reasons.
F11 0640  1       Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth
F11 0640 10    through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports
F11 0650  9    their roots. This serious condition, popularly known
F11 0660  4    as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes of tooth loss
F11 0670  4    in adults.
F11 0670  6       Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together teeth are
F11 0680  3    prone to trapping food particles, increasing the likelihood
F11 0690  2    of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says
F11 0690 11    Dr. Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".
F11 0710  1       The failure of teeth to fit together when closed
F11 0710 10    interferes with normal chewing, so that a child may
F11 0720  7    swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive
F11 0730  4    system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child
F11 0730 12    may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.
F11 0740  9    Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap
F11 0750  9    as lisping.
F11 0750 11    #THE WHEN AND HOW OF STRAIGHTENING#
F11 0760  4    "MOST orthodontic work is done on children between
F11 0770  2    the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients
F11 0780  1    as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr. Brodie.
F11 0780 13       In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of
F11 0790 11    teeth is usually completed, yet the continuing growth
F11 0800  5    of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively
F11 0810  3    easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are
F11 0820  2    held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal
F11 0820 12    membrane with an involved nerve network, to the bone
F11 0830  8    in the jaw; they are not anchored directly to the bone.
F11 0840  6    Abnormal pressure, applied over a period of time, produces
F11 0850  4    a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions
F11 0860  1    normally in the new position into which it has been
F11 0860 11    guided.
F11 0870  1       What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters
F11 0870 10    the orthodontist's office? On her first visit the orthodontist
F11 0880  8    will take X rays, photographs, tooth measurements,
F11 0890  4    and "tooth prints"- an impression of the mouth that
F11 0900  5    permits him to study her teeth and jaws.
F11 0910  1       If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for
F11 0910 11    Susie an appliance consisting of bands, plastic plates,
F11 0920  6    fine wires, and tiny springs. This appliance will exert
F11 0930  4    a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on
F11 0940  2    the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure
F11 0940 13    side of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on
F11 0950 11    the side from which the tooth has moved. This must
F11 0960  6    be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows,
F11 0970  2    and no faster.
F11 0970  5       "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious injury
F11 0980  2    can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding
F11 0990  1    bone holding them in place", explains Dr. Brodie. "Moving
F11 0990 10    one or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an
F11 1000 11    ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth
F11 1010  7    pattern of a child's face".
F11 1020  1       During the first few days of wearing the appliance
F11 1020 10    and immediately following each adjustment, Susan may
F11 1030  6    have a slight discomfort or soreness, but after a short
F11 1040  5    time this will disappear. Parents are often concerned
F11 1050  2    that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.
F11 1050 10    When in place, a well-cemented band actually protects
F11 1060  9    the part of the tooth that is covered.
F11 1070  4       Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit
F11 1080  3    the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on
F11 1080 12    the severity of her condition. During these visits
F11 1090  7    the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the
F11 1100  6    pressure on her teeth.
F11 1100 10       Last comes the retention stage. Susie's teeth have
F11 1110  6    now been guided into a desirable new position. But
F11 1120  4    because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original
F11 1130  3    position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them
F11 1130 12    in place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached
F11 1140 11    to the molars and stretching across the teeth. Susie
F11 1150  6    may wear this only at night or for a few hours during
F11 1160  5    the day.
F11 1160  7       Then comes the time when the last wire is removed
F11 1170  4    and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive
F11 1180  1    girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.
F11 1180 10       How long will this take? Straightening one tooth
F11 1190  7    that has come in wrong may take only a few months.
F11 1200  6    Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more. An
F11 1210  2    added complication such as a malformed jaw may take
F11 1210 11    two or three years to correct.
F11 1220  4    #WHAT IS THE COST?#
F11 1220  8    THE charge for a complete full-banded job differs in
F11 1230  7    various parts of the country. Work that might cost
F11 1240  4    $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200
F11 1250  1    in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure
F11 1250 11    for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to
F11 1260 10    $1,000.
F11 1260 11       "Factors in the cost of treatment are the length
F11 1270  9    of time involved and the skill and education of the
F11 1280  5    practitioner", says Dr. Brodie.
F11 1290  1       To become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed
F11 1290 10    by his state as a dentist, then he must spend at least
F11 1300  9    two years in additional training to acquire a license
F11 1310  5    as a specialist.
F11 1310  8       "Costs may seem high, but they used to be even higher",
F11 1320  8    says Dr. Brodie. "Fees are about half to a third of
F11 1330  8    what they were 25 years ago".
F11 1340  1       The reason? People today are aware of the value
F11 1340  9    of orthodontics, and as a result there are more practitioners
F11 1350  8    in the field.
F11 1350 11       Most orthodontists require an initial payment to
F11 1360  7    cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction
F11 1370  4    of the appliances, but usually the remainder of the
F11 1380  3    cost may be spread over a period of months or years.
F11 1380 14    In many cities in the United States clinics associated
F11 1390  8    with dental schools will take patients at a nominal
F11 1400  7    fee. Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic
F11 1410  4    treatment for children of needy parents.
F11 1410 10    #RESEARCH HELPS FAMILIES#
F11 1420  3    GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently by
F11 1430  2    orthodontists. Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head
F11 1430 11    growth, started 20 minutes after children's births.
F11 1440  7       "In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion
F11 1450 10    is hereditary was scoffed at; now we know that family
F11 1460  8    characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large
F11 1470  5    extent", he says. "Fortunately through our growth studies
F11 1480  3    we have been able to see what nature does, and that
F11 1490  1    helps us know what we can do".
F11 1490  8       This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis
F11 1500  4    and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit a small
F11 1510  3    jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.
F11 1510 12    In the past an orthodontist might have tried, over
F11 1520  7    four or five years, to straighten and fit the boy's
F11 1530  5    large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, would
F11 1540  2    never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend
F11 1540 10    extraction immediately.
F11 1550  2       In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge
F11 1560  1    of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting
F11 1560  8    four or five years before treatment. The child is kept
F11 1570  8    on call, and the orthodontist watches the growth. "Nature
F11 1580  5    often takes care of the problem", says Dr. Brodie.
F11 1590  4    "A child with a certain type of head and teeth will
F11 1600  2    outgrow tooth deformity".
F11 1600  5       That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist,
F11 1610  6    against their dentist's advice, that their child have
F11 1620  3    orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our
F11 1630  1    culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic
F11 1630  9    conditions, some parents demand that the dentist try
F11 1640  8    to correct a problem before it is wise to do so. Let
F11 1650  7    the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment",
F11 1660  2    he urges.
F11 1660  4       Superior new material for orthodontic work is another
F11 1670  4    result of research. Plastics are easier to handle than
F11 1680  2    the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save
F11 1680 10    time and money. Plaster of Paris, once utilized in
F11 1690  7    making impressions of teeth, has been replaced by alginates
F11 1700  5    (gelatin-like material) that work quickly and accurately
F11 1710  3    and with least discomfort to a child.
F11 1710 10    #PREVENTION IS BEST#
F11 1720  2    AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is
F11 1720 11    started, the less expensive and more satisfactory it
F11 1730  8    is likely to be.
F11 1740  1       "After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually
F11 1740 10    at the age of two and one half to three- it's time
F11 1750 10    for that first dental appointment", Dr. Brodie advises.
F11 1760  4    "Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup
F11 1770  5    once a year".
F11 1770  8       To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising,
F11 1780  4    your dentist can do these things:
F11 1790  1    _@_
F11 1790  1       He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss
F11 1790  9    of teeth. If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely
F11 1800  9    because of decay- and if no preventive steps are taken-
F11 1810  8    the other teeth may shift out of position, become overcrowded
F11 1820  5    and malformed. In turn the other teeth are likely to
F11 1830  4    decay because food particles may become impacted in
F11 1830 12    them.
