C11 0010  1       MISCHA ELMAN shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium
C11 0010  8    concert with three American composers.
C11 0020  5       His portion of the program- and a big portion it
C11 0030  8    was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century
C11 0040  1    concertos for the violin: to wit, the Mendelssohn and
C11 0040 10    the Tchaikovsky. That is an evening of music-making
C11 0050  9    that would faze many a younger man; Mr. Elman is 70
C11 0060  8    years old.
C11 0060 10       There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can
C11 0070  8    tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman. But,
C11 0080  4    with all due respects and allowances, it must truthfully
C11 0090  2    be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet,
C11 0100  1    more mannered than musical. The occasion was sentimental;
C11 0100  9    so was the playing.
C11 0110  2    #@#
C11 0110  3    The American part of the evening consisted of Paul
C11 0120  1    Creston's Dance Overture, William Schuman's "Chester"
C11 0130  1    from "New England Triptych" and two works of Wallingford
C11 0130 10    Riegger, Dance Rhythms, Op. 58, and a Romanza for Strings,
C11 0140  8    Op. 56A.
C11 0150  1       The Creston is purely a potboiler, with Spanish,
C11 0150  9    English, French and American dances mixed into the
C11 0160  8    stew. The Riegger, with its Latin hesitation bounce,
C11 0170  6    is just this side of the pale; like his sweet, attractive
C11 0180  5    Romanza, it belongs to what the composer called his
C11 0190  3    "Non-Dissonant (Mostly)" category of works. The Schuman
C11 0200  1    "Chester" takes off from an old William Billings tune
C11 0200 10    with rousing woodwind and brass effect.
C11 0210  6    #@#
C11 0210  7    All these- potboilers or no- provided a welcome breath
C11 0220  7    of fresh air in the form of lively, colorful, unstuffy
C11 0230  3    works well suited for the great out-of-doors. It was
C11 0240  2    nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change.
C11 0240 14    We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy
C11 0250  8    change of diet as well as the lively performances of
C11 0260  6    the Stadium Symphony.
C11 0270  1       A WOMAN who undergoes artificial insemination against
C11 0270  8    the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of
C11 0280 10    "A Question of Adultery", yesterday's new British import
C11 0290  5    at the Apollo.
C11 0300  1       Since an objective viewer might well conclude that
C11 0300  9    this is not a situation that would often arise, the
C11 0310  6    film's extensive discussion of the problem seems, at
C11 0320  4    best, superfluous. In its present artless, low-budget
C11 0330  1    form, the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial
C11 0330 10    wrath.
C11 0340  1       With Julie London enacting the central role with
C11 0340  9    husky-voiced sincerity, the longsuffering heroine is
C11 0360  6    at least attractive. The explanation offered for her
C11 0370  4    conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage
C11 0380  1    to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an
C11 0380 12    automobile accident.
C11 0390  2       Anthony Steel, as the husband, is a jealous type
C11 0400  1    who argues against her course and sues for divorce,
C11 0400 10    labeling her action adulterous. The actor plays his
C11 0410  6    role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey,
C11 0420  4    as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and
C11 0430  2    Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander.
C11 0430  8       After a protracted, hysterical trial scene more
C11 0440  5    notable for the frankness of its language than for
C11 0450  3    dramatic credibility, the jury, to no one's surprise,
C11 0460  1    leaves the legal question unresolved. When the husband
C11 0460  9    drops the case and returns to his wife, both seem sorry
C11 0470  9    they brought the matter up in the first place. So was
C11 0480  6    the audience.
C11 0490  1    _LONDON, JULY 4_
C11 0490  4       - For its final change of bill in its London season,
C11 0500  1    the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give
C11 0500 10    one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a
C11 0510  8    "gala program" at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.
C11 0520  6    No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all
C11 0530  7    the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its
C11 0540  2    presentations thus far, it too could give a circus
C11 0540 11    if it pleased.
C11 0550  1       And please it did, in every sense of the word, for
C11 0550 12    it had the audience shouting much of the time in a
C11 0560 10    manner far from typical of London audiences. At the
C11 0570  6    end of the program, indeed, there was a demonstration
C11 0580  2    that lasted for forty-five minutes, and nothing could
C11 0580 11    stop it. Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical
C11 0600  2    bit from the closing number, "Taras Bulba", but even
C11 0610  1    then there was a substantial number of diehards who
C11 0610 10    seemed determined not to go home at all. Only a plea
C11 0620 10    from the house manager, John Collins, finally broke
C11 0630  3    up the party.
C11 0630  6    #@#
C11 0630  7    But for all the manifest intention to "show off", this
C11 0640  6    was a circus with a difference, for instead of descending
C11 0650  4    in quality to what is known as a popular level, it
C11 0660  2    added further to the evidence that this is a very great
C11 0660 13    dancing company.
C11 0670  1       The "Taras Bulba" excerpt is a rousing version of
C11 0680  1    Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster
C11 0680  9    to music of Soloviev-Sedoi. It is danced by some thirty-five
C11 0690 11    men and no women, and it contains everything in the
C11 0700  7    books- lusty comedy, gregarious cavorting, and tricks
C11 0710  4    that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make
C11 0720  3    the human body perform. Yuri Soloviev, Oleg Sokolov,
C11 0720 11    Alexei Zhitkov, Lev Sokolov, Yuri Korneyev and Mr.
C11 0730  8    Livshitz were the chief soloists, but everybody on
C11 0740  6    stage was magnificent.
C11 0740  9    #@#
C11 0740 10    At the other extreme in character was the half-hour
C11 0750 10    excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet "Bayaderka",
C11 0760  3    which opened the evening. What a man this Petipa was!
C11 0770  6    And why do we in the West know so few of his ballets?
C11 0780  3    This scene is a "white ballet" in which a lovelorn
C11 0790  1    hero searches for his departed love's spirit among
C11 0790  9    twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful "shadows" who
C11 0800  4    can all dance like nothing human- which, of course,
C11 0810  6    is altogether fitting. The ensemble enters in a long
C11 0820  4    adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty, as
C11 0820 12    well as loveliness, and adagio is the general medium
C11 0830  7    of the piece.
C11 0830 10    #@#
C11 0830 11    Its ballerina, Olga Moiseyeva, performs simple miracles
C11 0840  7    of beauty, and Ludmilla Alexeyeva, Inna Korneyeva and
C11 0850  6    Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite
C11 0860  6    accomplishments. Sergei Vikulov, as the lone male,
C11 0870  3    meets the competition well with some brilliant hits,
C11 0870 11    but the work is designed to belong to the ladies.
C11 0880  9       The middle section of the program was made up of
C11 0890  8    short numbers, naturally enough of unequal merit, but
C11 0900  3    all of them pretty good at that. They consisted of
C11 0900 13    a new arrangement of "Nutcracker" excerpts danced stunningly
C11 0910  7    by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev, with a large ensemble;
C11 0920  9    a winning little "Snow Maiden" variation by the adorable
C11 0930  8    Galina Kekisheva; two of those poetic adagios in Greek
C11 0940  8    veils (and superb esthetic acrobacy) by Alla Osipenko
C11 0950  5    and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya
C11 0960  2    and Yuri Kornevey in the other; an amusing character
C11 0970  1    pas de cinq called "Gossiping Women"; a stirring "Flames
C11 0980  1    of Paris" pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre
C11 0980 12    Pavlovsky, and a lovely version of Fokine's "Le Cygne"
C11 0990  9    by Olga Moiseyeva, which had to be repeated.
C11 1000  7       Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor.
C11 1010  2       It was quite an evening!
C11 1020  1       A YEAR ago today, when the Democrats were fretting
C11 1020 10    and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was
C11 1030  9    still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned
C11 1040  7    for the power and responsibility of the Presidency,
C11 1050  4    Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes
C11 1060  3    about the Presidential campaign of 1960.
C11 1060  9       As the pace of the quadrennial American political
C11 1070  7    festival accelerated, Mr. White took more notes. He
C11 1080  6    traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard
C11 1090  4    M. Nixon.
C11 1090  6       He asked intimate questions and got frank answers
C11 1100  5    from the members of what he calls the candidates' "in-groups".
C11 1110  3    He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of
C11 1120  2    American politics in general, as well as about the
C11 1120 11    day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election
C11 1130  6    in American history.
C11 1140  1       Those of us who read the papers may think we know
C11 1140 12    a good deal about that election; how little we know
C11 1150  7    of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly
C11 1160  3    clear by Mr. White in "The Making of the President
C11 1170  1    1960".
C11 1170  2       This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting
C11 1180  2    one. What might have been only warmed-over topical
C11 1180 11    journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution
C11 1190  8    to history. Mr. White, who is only a competent novelist,
C11 1200  8    is a brilliant reporter. His zest for specific detail,
C11 1210  5    his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere, his tireless
C11 1220  3    industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute
C11 1220 11    to the effectiveness of his book.
C11 1230  5    #A LESSON IN POLITICS#
C11 1230  9    As a dramatic narrative "The Making of the President
C11 1240  7    1960" is continuously engrossing. And as an introduction
C11 1250  6    to American politics it is highly educational.
C11 1270  1       The author begins this volume with a close-up of
C11 1270 11    Mr. Kennedy, his family and his entourage waiting for
C11 1280  9    the returns. He then switches back to a consideration
C11 1290  8    of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls: five
C11 1300  3    Democrats- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Senator Stuart
C11 1310  3    Symington, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai E. Stevenson
C11 1320  3    and Mr. Kennedy- and two Republicans- Governor Rockefeller
C11 1330  2    and Mr. Nixon.
C11 1330  5       Then, in chronological order, Mr. White covers the
C11 1340  6    primary campaigns, the conventions and the Presidential
C11 1350  3    campaign itself. In the process he writes at length
C11 1360  1    about many related matters: the importance of race,
C11 1360  9    religion, local tradition, bosses, organizations, zealous
C11 1370  5    volunteers and television. Mr. White is bluntly frank
C11 1380  6    in his personal opinions. He frequently cites intimate
C11 1390  3    details that seem to come straight from the horse's
C11 1400  1    mouth, from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy
C11 1400  9    himself; but never from Mr. Nixon, who looked on reporters
C11 1410  9    with suspicion and distrust.
C11 1420  2       "Rarely in American history has there been a political
C11 1430  1    campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them
C11 1430  9    less", says Mr. White. Mr. Nixon, he believes, has
C11 1440  9    no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his
C11 1450  5    own campaign. Although a skillful politician and a
C11 1460  4    courageous and honest man, Mr. Nixon, Mr. White believes,
C11 1470  2    ignored his own top-level planners, wasted time and
C11 1470 11    effort in the wrong regions, missed opportunities through
C11 1480  8    indecision and damaged his chances on television.
C11 1490  6       Mr. Nixon is "a broody, moody man, given to long
C11 1500  6    stretches of introspection; he trusts only himself
C11 1510  2    and his wife. ... He is a man of major talent- but
C11 1510 14    a man of solitary, uncertain impulses. ... He was above
C11 1520  9    all a friend seeker, almost pathetic in his eagerness
C11 1530  6    to be liked. He wanted to identify with people and
C11 1540  4    have a connection with them; ... the least inspiring
C11 1550  1    candidate since Alfred M. Landon".
C11 1550  6       Mr. Kennedy, Mr. White believes, "had mastered politics
C11 1560  7    on so many different levels that no other American
C11 1580  2    could match him". Calm, dignified, composed, "superbly
C11 1590  2    eloquent", Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about
C11 1600  2    everybody. He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and
C11 1600 11    of many zealous volunteers. Every decision was made
C11 1610  6    quickly on sound grounds. Efficiency was enforced and
C11 1620  5    nothing was left to chance. Mr. Kennedy did not neglect
C11 1630  4    to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.
C11 1640  1    Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt
C11 1640 10    that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy
C11 1650  7    to be a fine President.
C11 1660  1    #PRESSURES PORTRAYED#
C11 1660  3    Throughout "The Making of a President" Mr. White shows
C11 1670  4    wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates,
C11 1680  2    how decisions have constantly to be made, how fatigue
C11 1680 11    and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down,
C11 1690  8    how subordinates play key roles. And he makes many
C11 1700  7    interesting comments. Here are several:
C11 1710  1       "The root question in American politics is always:
C11 1720  1    Who's the Man to See? To understand American politics
C11 1720 10    is, simply, to know people, to know the relative weight
C11 1730  9    of names- who are heroes, who are straw men, who controls,
C11 1740  8    who does not. But to operate in American politics one
C11 1750  5    must go a step further- one must build a bridge to
C11 1760  3    such names, establish a warmth, a personal connection".
C11 1760 11       "In the hard life of politics it is well known that
C11 1770 12    no platform nor any program advanced by either major
C11 1780  8    American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion".
C11 1790  4       "All platforms are meaningless: the program of either
C11 1800  5    party is what lies in the vision and conscience of
C11 1810  2    the candidate the party chooses to lead it".
C11 1820  1       NOSTALGIA WEEK at Lewisohn Stadium, which had begun
C11 1820  9    with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman
C11 1830 10    on Tuesday night, continued last night as Lily Pons
C11 1840  7    led the list of celebrities in an evening of French
C11 1850  4    operatic excerpts.
C11 1850  6       Miss Pons is certainly not 70-no singer ever is-
C11 1870  4    and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in
C11 1880  4    paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than
C11 1880 15    in present accomplishments. The better part of gallantry
C11 1890  8    might be, perhaps, to honor her perennial good looks
C11 1900  7    and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown, and to chide the
C11 1910  5    orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which
C11 1920  1    she had chosen to sing.
C11 1920  6       No orchestra, however, could be expected to follow
C11 1930  3    a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch
C11 1930 12    as Miss Pons encountered last night. In all fairness,
C11 1940  9    there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear,
C11 1950  7    flashes even of the old consummate vocalism.
C11 1960  2    #@#
C11 1960  3    One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons
C11 1970  3    sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's "Shadow Song". The
C11 1980  2    years suddenly fell away at this point. On the whole,
C11 1980 12    however, one must wonder at just what it is that forces
C11 1990 10    a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as
C11 2000  5    time marches inexorably on.
C11 2000  9       Sharing the program was the young French-Canadian
C11 2010  8    tenor Richard Verreau, making his stadium debut on
C11 2020  6    this occasion. Mr. Verreau began shakily, with a voice
C11 2030  4    that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed
C11 2040  1    beyond middle volume. Later on this problem vanished,
C11 2040  9    and the "Flower Song" from Bizet's "Carmen" was beautifully
C11 2050  7    and intelligently projected.
