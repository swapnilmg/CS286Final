G40 0010  1       I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole. It had
G40 0010 10    a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the
G40 0020  8    chairing of the bards. It was here that the terror-stricken
G40 0030  6    Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's
G40 0040  4    party. A much larger room, adjacent to the lavatory,
G40 0050  2    served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet.
G40 0050 12    That unused room was large enough for- well, say an
G40 0060 10    elephant could get into it ... and, as a matter of
G40 0070  9    fact, an elephant did ...
G40 0080  1       Something occurred on the morning of the children's
G40 0080  8    party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our
G40 0090  7    restricted toilet facilities caused us. It so happened
G40 0100  5    that sports writer Arthur Robinson got out of the hospital
G40 0110  2    that morning after promising his doctor that he would
G40 0110 11    be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence.
G40 0120  9    Arthur Robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as
G40 0130  6    staff correspondent for the American. He was ghost
G40 0140  4    writer for Babe Ruth, whose main talent for literary
G40 0150  1    composition was the signing of his autograph. Robbie
G40 0150  9    was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees.
G40 0160  5       He arrived on crutches at the Newspaper Club with
G40 0170  4    one of his great pals, Oliver Herford, artist, author,
G40 0180  2    and foe of stupidity. Mr. Herford's appearance was
G40 0180 10    that of a frustrated gnome. He seemed timid (at first),
G40 0190 10    wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled,
G40 0200  7    and was no bigger than a jockey. Robinson asked Herford
G40 0210  4    to escort him to the club's lavatory before they sat
G40 0220  3    down for a highball and a game of cards. In the jakes,
G40 0230  1    after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed,
G40 0230  9    Mr. Herford went to the adjoining facility. He had
G40 0240  8    barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged
G40 0250  6    through the doorway. Without any regard for rest-room
G40 0260  3    protocol, the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford
G40 0260 10    off his pins. The artist-author said nothing, but stood
G40 0270 10    to one side. He waited a long time. Nothing was said,
G40 0280  8    nothing accomplished. The unrelieved stranger eventually
G40 0290  3    turned away from the place of his- shall we dare say
G40 0300  4    his Waterloo?- to go to the door.
G40 0300 11       Mr. Herford touched the fat man's arm. "Pardon me,
G40 0310  8    sir. May I say that you have just demonstrated the
G40 0320  6    truth of an old proverb- the younger Pliny's, if memory
G40 0330  4    serves me- which, translated freely from the archaic
G40 0340  2    Latin, says, 'The more haste, the less peed'".
G40 0350  1       Governor Alfred E. Smith was the official host at
G40 0350 10    the children's party. United States Senator Royal S.
G40 0360  7    Copeland was wearing the robes of Santa Claus and a
G40 0370  8    great white beard; the Honorable Robert Wagner, Sr.,
G40 0380  4    at that time a justice of the New York Supreme Court,
G40 0390  2    was on the reception committee. I was in charge of
G40 0390 12    the arrangements- which were soon enough disarranged.
G40 0400  6       I had had difficulties from the very first day.
G40 0410  7    When, in my enthusiasm, I proposed the party, my city
G40 0420  5    editor (who disliked the club and many of its members)
G40 0430  2    tried to block my participation in the gala event.
G40 0430 11    Even earlier than that he had resented the fact that
G40 0440  9    I had been chosen to edit the club's Reporter.
G40 0450  4       City editor Victor Watson of the New York American
G40 0460  4    was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts
G40 0470  2    of mood. Mr. Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor
G40 0480  1    Watson was "fatboy". The staff saw in him the qualities
G40 0480 11    of a Don Cossack, hence, as mentioned before, his nickname
G40 0490  9    "the Hetman".
G40 0500  1       The Hetman's physical aspects were not those of
G40 0500  9    a savage rider of the steppes. Indeed, he looked more
G40 0510  9    like a well-fleshed lay brother of the Hospice of St.
G40 0520  8    Bernard. Nor were his manners barbaric. He had a purring
G40 0530  6    voice and poker player's immobility of features which
G40 0540  2    somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all
G40 0540 11    the bodies were buried. He was the son of a Scottish
G40 0550 11    father and an American Jewish mother, long widowed,
G40 0560  5    with whom he lived in a comfortable home in Flushing.
G40 0570  4    He had worked in the newspaper business since he was
G40 0580  2    nineteen years old, always for the Hearst service.
G40 0580 10    From the very first he regarded himself as Mr. Hearst's
G40 0590  8    disciple, defender, and afterward his prime minister,
G40 0600  5    self-ordained.
G40 0600  7       It was said that the Hetman plotted to take over
G40 0610  7    the entire Hearst newspaper empire one day by means
G40 0620  5    of various coups: the destruction of editors who tried
G40 0630  2    to halt his course, the unfrocking of publishers whose
G40 0630 11    mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports
G40 0640  9    to Mr. Hearst. Whatever the Hetman's ambitions, his
G40 0650  5    colleagues were kept ill at ease. Among the outstanding
G40 0660  4    members of the Hearst cabinet whom he successfully
G40 0670  1    opposed for a time were the great Arthur Brisbane,
G40 0670 10    Bradford Merrill, S.S. Carvalho, and Colonel Van Hamm.
G40 0680  8    He also disliked Runyon, for no good reason other than
G40 0690  8    the fact that the Demon's talent was so marked as to
G40 0700  7    put him well beyond the Hetman's say-so or his supervision.
G40 0710  4       Runyon, for his part, had a contemptuous regard
G40 0720  2    for Mr. Watson. "He's a wrong-o", said Runyon, "and
G40 0730  2    I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw the Statue
G40 0730 14    of Liberty".
G40 0740  2       Arthur "Bugs" Baer wrote to me just recently, "Vic
G40 0750  2    wanted to die in harness, with his head towards the
G40 0750 12    wagon. He supported his mother and his brother, who
G40 0760  9    afterwards committed suicide. Watson told me that his
G40 0770  7    brother always sent roses to his mother, blossoms bought
G40 0780  3    with Vic's allowance to him. 'And would you believe
G40 0790  2    it', Vic added, 'she likes him better than she does
G40 0790 12    me. Why'"?
G40 0800  2       About the only time the Hetman seemed excited was
G40 0810  1    when one of his own pet ideas was born. Then he would
G40 0810 13    get to his feet, as though rising in honor of his own
G40 0820  9    remarkable powers, and say almost invariably, "Gentlemen,
G40 0830  3    this is an amazing story! It's bigger than the Armistice".
G40 0840  4       Some of the Hetman's "ideas" were dream-ridden,
G40 0850  4    vaguely imparted, and at times preposterous. One day
G40 0860  2    he assigned me to lay bare a "plot" by the Duponts
G40 0860 13    to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution
G40 0870  7    he said was about to occur in Cuba. He said that his
G40 0880  7    information was so secret that he would not be able
G40 0890  4    to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.
G40 0900  1       "I can tell you this much", he said. It's bigger
G40 0900 10    than the Armistice".
G40 0910  1       I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment
G40 0920  1    and consulted several of my own well-informed sources.
G40 0920 10    Then I spent the next two days at the baseball park
G40 0930  9    and at Jack Doyle's pool parlors. When I returned to
G40 0940  6    make my report, the Hetman did not remember having
G40 0950  2    sent me on the secret mission. He was busy, he said,
G40 0950 13    in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation.
G40 0960  9    And I was to go to work on that odd matter. I shall
G40 0970  9    tell of it later on.
G40 0970 14       The Hetman had a strong liking for a story, any
G40 0980 10    story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing
G40 0990  6    or by roundabout methods. Most of my stories were obtained
G40 1000  3    by simply seeking out the person who could give me
G40 1010  1    the facts, and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.
G40 1010 12       One day I tired of following the Hetman's advice
G40 1020  8    of "shadowing" and of the "ring-around-the-rosie" approach
G40 1030  8    to a report that Enrico Caruso had pinched a lady's
G40 1040  5    hip while visiting the Central Park monkey house. I
G40 1050  3    explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and
G40 1060  1    to "Bugs" Baer. Mr. Baer obtained a supply of crepe
G40 1060 11    hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars. We
G40 1070 10    fashioned beards, put them on, and reported to the
G40 1080  7    Hetman at the city desk.
G40 1080 12       Mr. Baer had an auburn beard, like Longfellow's.
G40 1090  8    Mr. McCay had on a sort of Emperor Maximilian beard
G40 1100  7    and mustache. As for myself, I had on an enormous black
G40 1110  6    "muff". This, together with a derby hat and horn-rim
G40 1120  4    eyeglasses, gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist.
G40 1130  1       "We are ready for your next mysterious assignment",
G40 1130  9    said Mr. Baer to the Hetman. "Where to, sir"?
G40 1140  9       Mr. Watson did not have much humor in his make-up,
G40 1150 10    but he managed a mirthless smile. Just then a reporter
G40 1160  6    telephoned in from the Bronx to give the rewrite desk
G40 1170  4    an account of a murder. The Hetman told me to take
G40 1180  1    the story over the phone and to write it. While I was
G40 1180 13    sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby
G40 1190  8    and my great beard, Arthur Brisbane whizzed in with
G40 1200  5    some editorial copy in his hand. He paused for a moment
G40 1210  4    to look at me, then went on to the city desk to deliver
G40 1220  1    his "Today" column.
G40 1220  4       I thought it expedient to take off my derby, my
G40 1230  3    glasses, and the beard; and also to change telephones.
G40 1230 12    I managed to do this by the time the great A.B. returned
G40 1240 12    to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist.
G40 1250  9    He stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant
G40 1260  6    desk. Then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly
G40 1270  4    out of the room. He had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression.
G40 1280  1    He had been "seeing things".
G40 1280  6       The Hetman's "ideas" for news stories or editorial
G40 1290  6    campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking
G40 1300  3    in merit. He campaigned successfully for the riddance
G40 1310  1    of "Death Avenue" and also brought about the ending
G40 1310 10    of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage. He
G40 1320  7    exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance
G40 1330  5    of two excellent reporters, Nat Ferber and Carl Helm.
G40 1340  4    In the conduct of these and many other campaigns, the
G40 1350  1    Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his
G40 1350 11    critics allowed.
G40 1360  1       It seems to me now, in a long backward glance, that
G40 1360 12    many of the Hetman's conceits and odd actions- together
G40 1370  8    with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet
G40 1380  5    in the name of Mr. Hearst- were keyed with the tragedy
G40 1390  5    which was to close over him one day. Alone, rejected
G40 1400  2    on every hand, divorced, and in financial trouble,
G40 1400 10    he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the Abbey
G40 1410  9    Hotel in 1937.
G40 1410 12       One finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely
G40 1420 10    figure who waited for days for a saving word from his
G40 1430  9    zealously served idol, W.R. Hearst. That word was withheld
G40 1440  6    when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair.
G40 1450  4    The unfinished note, written in pencil upon the back
G40 1460  1    of a used envelope, and addressed to the coroner, makes
G40 1460 11    one wonder about many things: "God forgive me for everything.
G40 1470  9    I cannot ..."
G40 1480  2       Much to Damon Runyon's amazement, as well as my
G40 1480 11    own, I got along splendidly with the Hetman; that is,
G40 1490 10    until I became an editor, hence, in his eyes, a rival.
G40 1500  9    Not long after Colonel Van Hamm had foisted me on the
G40 1510  7    Watson staff I received a salary raise and a contract
G40 1520  4    on the Hetman's recommendation. During the next years
G40 1530  1    he gave me the second of the five contracts I would
G40 1530 12    sign with the Hearst Service. It was a somewhat unusual
G40 1540  8    thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days
G40 1550  7    before the epidemic of syndicated columnists. I would
G40 1560  3    like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement.
G40 1570  1    Somehow I think that Watson paid more attention to
G40 1570 10    me than he otherwise might have because his foe, Colonel
G40 1580  8    Van Hamm, wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.
G40 1590  9       I remember one day when Mr. Hearst (and I never
G40 1600  6    knew why he liked me, either) sent the Hetman a telegram:
G40 1610  4    "Please find some more reporters like that young man
G40 1620  3    from Denver". Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van
G40 1620 12    Hamm. The colonel grunted, then made a remark which
G40 1630  9    might be construed in either of two ways. "Don't bother
G40 1640  8    to look any further. We already have the only one of
G40 1650  6    its kind".
G40 1650  8       The Hetman did have friends, but they were mostly
G40 1660  6    outside the newspaper profession. Sergeant Mike Donaldson,
G40 1670  3    Congressional Medal of Honor soldier, was one of them.
G40 1680  4    Dr. Menas S. Gregory was another. I used to go with
G40 1690  2    Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment,
G40 1690 12    to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of statues,
G40 1700  8    paintings, and books and drink Oriental coffee while
G40 1710  7    Watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable.
G40 1720  4       There was one time, however, when his face clouded
G40 1730  3    and he suddenly blurted, "Why did my brother commit
G40 1740  1    suicide"?
G40 1740  2       I cannot remember Dr. Gregory's reply, if, indeed,
G40 1750  2    he made one.
