G08 0010  1    #TOBACCO ROAD IS DEAD. LONG LIVE TOBACCO ROAD.#
G08 0010  9    Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today
G08 0020  7    informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried
G08 0030  6    beneath a four-lane super highway, over which travel
G08 0040  3    each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with
G08 0040 10    the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop. Thus
G08 0050 10    we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South-
G08 0060  8    an urbanization which, despite its dramatic and overwhelming
G08 0070  5    effects upon the Southern culture, has been utterly
G08 0080  4    ignored by the bulk of Southern writers. Indeed, it
G08 0090  1    seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco
G08 0090 10    Road, with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly
G08 0100  8    and cornbread and mint juleps, continue to live- but
G08 0110  6    only as a weary, overexploited phantom.
G08 0120  1       Those writers known collectively as the "Southern
G08 0120  8    school" have received accolades from even those critics
G08 0130  8    least prone to eulogize; according to many critics,
G08 0140  5    in fact, the South has led the North in literature
G08 0150  3    since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
G08 0160  1    Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren
G08 0170  1    have led the field of somewhat less important writers
G08 0170 10    in a sort of post-bellum renaissance. It is interesting,
G08 0180  5    however, that despite this strong upsurge in Southern
G08 0190  5    writing, almost none of the writers has forsaken the
G08 0200  3    firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy
G08 0200 12    colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts
G08 0210  9    the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops;
G08 0220  6    of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as
G08 0230  4    they plow the fields; of these and a host of other
G08 0240  2    antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive
G08 0240 10    leaps of the past century. This is not to say that
G08 0250 11    the South is no longer agrarian; such a statement would
G08 0260  6    be the rankest form of oversimplification. But the
G08 0270  3    South is, and has been for the past century, engaged
G08 0280  1    in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough,
G08 0280  9    is not reflected in its literature.
G08 0290  4       In 1900 the South was only 15% urban; in 1950 it
G08 0300  4    had become 47.1% urban. In a mere half-century the
G08 0300 14    South has more than tripled its urban status. There
G08 0310  9    is a New South emerging, a South losing the folksy
G08 0320  6    traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity
G08 0330  3    of an avalanche- especially within recent decades.
G08 0330 10    As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization,
G08 0340  8    it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North-
G08 0350  7    a tendency which Willard Thorp terms "Yankeefication",
G08 0360  4    as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte, Birmingham,
G08 0370  2    and Houston. It is said that, even at the present stage
G08 0380  2    of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is
G08 0380 11    not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton. Undoubtedly
G08 0390  6    even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the
G08 0400  6    new wind: William Styron mentions in his latest novel
G08 0410  5    an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder, a Civil War
G08 0420  2    general, now renamed, in typical California fashion,
G08 0420  9    "Buena Vista Terrace". The effects of television and
G08 0430  8    other mass media are erasing regional dialects and
G08 0440  6    localisms with a startling force. As for progress,
G08 0450  4    the "backward South" can boast of Baton Rouge, which
G08 0460  2    increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two
G08 0460 11    hundred and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second
G08 0470  9    largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000.
G08 0480  6       The field, then, is ripe for new Southerners to
G08 0490  4    step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century
G08 0500  1    phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban
G08 0500  8    economy, the city-dweller, the pains of transition,
G08 0510  8    the labor problems; the list is, obviously, endless.
G08 0520  5    But these sources have not been tapped. Truman Capote
G08 0530  3    is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating
G08 0540  1    the old Southern legends into something beautiful and
G08 0540  9    grotesque, but as unreal as- or even more unreal than-
G08 0550  9    yesterday. William Styron, while facing the changing
G08 0560  6    economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, insists he
G08 0570  3    is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet
G08 0580  2    includes traditional Southern concepts in everything
G08 0580  8    he publishes. Even the great god Faulkner, the South's
G08 0590  8    one probable contender for literary immortality, has
G08 0600  5    little concerned himself with these matters; such are
G08 0610  3    simply not within his bounded province.
G08 0610  9       Where are the writers to treat these changes? Has
G08 0620  9    the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that
G08 0630  6    the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted?
G08 0640  3    Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older
G08 0650  2    order because they consider it useful and reliable
G08 0650 10    through repeated testings over the decades. Lacking
G08 0660  6    the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy,
G08 0670  6    these writers seem to be contenting themselves with
G08 0680  2    an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.
G08 0680 13       An example of the changes which have crept over
G08 0690 10    the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's
G08 0700  8    quest for a position in the white-dominated society,
G08 0710  5    a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction
G08 0720  2    especially since 1865. Today the Negro must discover
G08 0720 10    his role in an industrialized South, which indicates
G08 0730  8    that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't
G08 0740  7    changed radically, but rather has gradually come to
G08 0750  5    be reflected in this new context, this new coat of
G08 0760  2    paint. The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty
G08 0760 12    in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did
G08 0770  9    in an agrarian one. This represents a gradual change
G08 0780  5    in an ever-present social problem. But there have been
G08 0790  3    abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines,
G08 0800  1    the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even
G08 0800 11    ten years ago. Today's evidence, such as the fact that
G08 0810  8    only three Southern states (South Carolina, Alabama
G08 0820  4    and Mississippi) still openly defy integration, would
G08 0830  2    have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into
G08 0830  9    speechlessness.
G08 0840  1       Other examples of gradual changes that have affected
G08 0850  2    the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the
G08 0850 14    busses; his requesting, and often getting, higher wages,
G08 0860  8    better working conditions, better schools- changes
G08 0870  4    that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court
G08 0880  4    decision of 1954. Then came this decision, which sped
G08 0890  2    the process of gaining equality (or perhaps hindered
G08 0890 10    it; only historical evolution will determine which):
G08 0900  6    an abrupt change.
G08 0910  1       Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice
G08 0910  9    has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion. He has
G08 0920  8    frequently refused to move from white lunch counters,
G08 0930  5    refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust,
G08 0940  3    while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws.
G08 0950  2    This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience,
G08 0960  1    is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt
G08 0960  9    change in the Southern way of existence. A new order
G08 0970  7    is thrusting itself into being. A new South is emerging
G08 0980  6    after the post-bellum years of hesitation, uncertainty,
G08 0990  2    and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new
G08 0990 13    role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations
G08 1000  8    of the white man.
G08 1010  2       The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into
G08 1010 12    Southern fiction. It is clear that, while most writers
G08 1020  9    enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble
G08 1030  8    old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs" and "sho' nufs"
G08 1040  4    with blissful deference to his white employer (or,
G08 1050  2    in Old South terms, "massuh"), this stereotype is doomed
G08 1060  1    to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester.
G08 1060 10    While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps
G08 1070  9    scattered through the rural South, such men appear
G08 1080  7    to be a vanishing breed. Writers openly admit that
G08 1090  4    the Negro is easier to write than the white man; but
G08 1100  2    they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality,
G08 1100 11    but a Negro type. Presenting an individualized Negro
G08 1110  6    character, it would seem, is one of the most difficult
G08 1120  8    assignments a Southern writer could tackle; and the
G08 1130  4    success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above,
G08 1140  1    glaringly rare.
G08 1140  3       Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual
G08 1150  2    and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also
G08 1150 10    points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern
G08 1160  8    literature. The book concerned with the Negro's role
G08 1170  6    in an urban society is rare indeed; recently only Keith
G08 1180  4    Wheeler's novel, Peaceable Lane, has openly faced the
G08 1190  4    problem.
G08 1190  5       All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers
G08 1200  3    admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in
G08 1210  1    actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied
G08 1210  9    by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic
G08 1220  6    traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way
G08 1230  4    of life. Many earlier writers, mourning the demise
G08 1240  1    of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate
G08 1240 10    this "gracious Old South" imagery, creating such lasting
G08 1250  7    impressions as Margaret Mitchell's "Tara" plantation.
G08 1270  3    Modern writers, who are supposed to keep their fingers
G08 1280  5    firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist upon
G08 1300  2    drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when
G08 1300 10    it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation
G08 1310  6    of the past century. Perhaps these writers have been
G08 1320  5    too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but they can
G08 1330  3    hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama
G08 1330 12    is dead. As John T. Westbrook says in his article,
G08 1340  9    "Twilight of Southern Regionalism" (Southwest Review,
G08 1350  4    Winter 1957): "... The miasmal mausoleum where an Old
G08 1360  7    South, already too minutely autopsied in prose and
G08 1370  5    poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever dead
G08 1380  2    and (let us fervently hope) forever done with".
G08 1380 10       Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers'
G08 1390  6    creation of an unreal image of their homeland, which
G08 1400  5    is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers
G08 1410  2    and visiting Yankees: "Our northerner is suspicious
G08 1410  9    of all this crass evidence [of urbanization] presented
G08 1420  8    to his senses. It bewilders and befuddles him. He is
G08 1430  8    too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn
G08 1440  5    Warren. The fumes of progress are in his nose and the
G08 1450  4    bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but
G08 1450 13    his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback
G08 1460  9    hogs and night riders. On this trip to the South he
G08 1470  9    wants, above all else, to sniff the effluvium of
G08 1480  4    backwoods-and-sand-hill
G08 1480  8    subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight".
G08 1490  7    Obviously, such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat
G08 1500  4    akin to a child's experience with Disneyland: he wants
G08 1510  3    to see a world of make-believe.
G08 1510 10       In the meantime, while the South has been undergoing
G08 1520  8    this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing
G08 1530  5    to the curious Yankee, Southern writers have certainly
G08 1540  3    done little to reflect and promote their region's progress.
G08 1550  2    Willard Thorp, in his new book American Writing in
G08 1560  1    the Twentieth Century, observes, quite validly it seems:
G08 1560  9    "... Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have
G08 1570  8    been only lightly touched. No southern novelist has
G08 1580  5    done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick, Dreiser,
G08 1590  3    and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New
G08 1600  3    York ... There are almost no fictional treatments of
G08 1600 12    the industrialized south". Not a single Southern author,
G08 1610  8    major or minor, has made the urban problems of an urban
G08 1620  9    South his primary source material.
G08 1630  1       Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing
G08 1640  1    fingers of all assailants in this regard. Faulkner
G08 1640  9    culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully
G08 1650  6    than it has ever been, or could ever be, done. He has
G08 1660  6    made it his, and his it remains, irrevocably. He treats
G08 1670  3    it with a mythological, universal application.
G08 1670  9       As his disciples boast, even though his emphasis
G08 1680  8    is elsewhere, Faulkner does show his awareness of the
G08 1690  7    changing order of the South quite keenly, as can be
G08 1700  4    proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes
G08 1710  1    families. Even two decades ago in Go Down, Moses Faulkner
G08 1720  1    was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer
G08 1720 11    of hope that through its youth and its new way of life
G08 1730  9    the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery
G08 1740  4    erased from its soil. Yet his concern even here is
G08 1750  1    with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general,
G08 1750 10    and he never deals with such specific aspects of this
G08 1760  8    change as the urban and industrial impact.
G08 1770  2       Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga
G08 1780  1    of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which
G08 1780  8    seep into the South, building layer upon layer of minute,
G08 1790  8    subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to
G08 1800  4    hide the Old Way. Thus Faulkner reminds us, and wisely,
G08 1810  4    that the "new" South has gradually evolved out of the
G08 1820  2    Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist.
G08 1820 10    Yet he presents a realm of source material which may
G08 1830  9    well serve other writers if not himself: the problems
G08 1840  6    with which a New South must grapple in groping through
G08 1850  4    a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.
G08 1860  1    With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform
G08 1860  9    the work of six men: a machine stands between the agrarian
G08 1870  9    and his soil. The thousands of city migrants who desert
G08 1880  7    the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress
G08 1890  4    and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering
G08 1900  2    to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.
