G45 0010  1       "Suppose you take Mr. Hearst's morning American
G45 0010  8    at $10,000 a year", Brisbane proposed. "You could come
G45 0020  9    down to the office once a day, look over a few exchanges,
G45 0030 10    dictate an editorial, and then have the remainder of
G45 0040  7    your time for your more serious literary labors. If
G45 0050  3    within one year you can make a success out of the American,
G45 0060  1    you can practically name your own salary thereafter.
G45 0060  9    Of course, if you don't make the American a success,
G45 0070  9    Hearst will have no further use for you".
G45 0080  6       The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike
G45 0090  4    living in New York, and the deal fell through. Hearst's
G45 0100  1    luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin
G45 0100 12    K. Lane, a prominent California journalist and reform
G45 0110  8    politician, whom he asked for his support. Lane was
G45 0120  8    still burning because he had narrowly missed election
G45 0130  3    as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat
G45 0140  1    to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner.
G45 0140  9    Hearst disclaimed blame for this, but the conversation,
G45 0150  8    according to Lane, ended on a tart note.
G45 0160  6       "Mr. Lane", Hearst said, "if you ever wish anything
G45 0170  5    that I can do, all you will have to do will be to send
G45 0180  4    me a telegram asking, and it will be done".
G45 0180 13       "Mr. Hearst", Lane replied as he left, "if you ever
G45 0190 10    get a telegram from me asking you to do anything, you
G45 0200  9    can put the telegram down as a forgery".
G45 0210  4       Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New
G45 0220  2    York to become a father. On April 10, 1904, his first
G45 0220 13    child was born, a son named George after the late Senator.
G45 0230 10    Hearst saw his wife and child, sent a joyful message
G45 0240  7    to his mother in California, and soon returned to Washington,
G45 0250  5    where on April 22, for the first time, he opened his
G45 0260  4    mouth in Congress.
G45 0260  7       This was not before the House but before the Judiciary
G45 0270  5    Committee, where he asked for action on one of his
G45 0280  4    pet bills, that calling for an investigation of the
G45 0280 13    coal-railroad monopoly. Attorney Shearn had worked
G45 0290  6    on this for two years and had succeeded in getting
G45 0300  5    a report supporting his stand from the United States
G45 0310  2    Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Hearst
G45 0320  1    had spent more than $60,000 of his own money in the
G45 0320 12    probe, but still Attorney General Knox was quiescent.
G45 0330  6       Six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater
G45 0340  5    from the Pennsylvania fields, Hearst said, not only
G45 0350  3    had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned
G45 0350 11    outright at least eleven mines. They had watered their
G45 0360  9    stock at immense profit, then had raised the price
G45 0370  7    of coal fifty cents a ton, netting themselves another
G45 0380  2    $20,000,000 in annual profit.
G45 0380  6       "The Attorney General has been brooding over that
G45 0390  7    evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen
G45 0400  4    months", Hearst said. "He has not acted in any way,
G45 0410  3    and won't let anyone take it away from him ... What
G45 0410 14    I want is to have this evidence come before Congress
G45 0420  9    and if the Attorney General does not report it, as
G45 0430  7    I am very sure he won't, as he has refused to do anything
G45 0440  5    of the kind, I then wish that a committee of seven
G45 0450  2    Representatives be appointed with power to take the
G45 0450 10    evidence ...".
G45 0460  1       The Congressman tried hard, but failed. This was
G45 0460  9    the very sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself
G45 0470  7    had in mind. There can be little doubt that there was
G45 0480  7    a conspiracy in Washington, overt or implied, to block
G45 0490  4    anything Hearst wanted, even if it was something good.
G45 0500  1    Hatred tied his hands in Congress. Roosevelt and others
G45 0500 10    considered him partly responsible for the murder of
G45 0510  8    McKinley. They were repelled by his noisy newspapers,
G45 0520  5    his personal publicity, his presumptuous campaign for
G45 0540  3    the Presidential nomination, and by the swelling cloud
G45 0550  1    of rumor about his moral lapses. He might get votes
G45 0550 11    from his constituents, but he would never get a helping
G45 0560  8    hand in Congress. He was the House pariah. Even the
G45 0570  5    regular Democrats disowned him. Inherently incapable
G45 0580  2    of cooperating with others, he ran his own show regardless
G45 0590  1    of how many party-line Democratic toes he stepped on.
G45 0590 11    He was a political maverick, a reformer with his own
G45 0600  7    program, determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon
G45 0610  6    the infamy of those who balked him. He showed little
G45 0620  2    interest in measures put forward by the regular Democrats.
G45 0630  1    He sought to run Congress as he ran his New York American
G45 0630 13    or Journal, a scheme veteran legislators resisted.
G45 0640  7    For a freshman Congressman to read political lessons
G45 0650  5    to graybeard Democrats was poor policy for one who
G45 0660  5    needed to make friends. He soon quarreled with all
G45 0670  1    the party leaders in the House, and came to be regarded
G45 0670 12    with detestation by regular Democrats as a professional
G45 0680  7    radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose
G45 0690  6    constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline.
G45 0700  3       To old-line Democrats, the Hearst Presidential boom,
G45 0710  2    now in full cry, was the joke of the new century. Yet
G45 0710 14    no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to
G45 0720 11    give the puissant T. R. a semblance of a race. There
G45 0730  8    was talk of dragging old ex-President Cleveland out
G45 0740  3    of retirement for another try. Some preferred Judge
G45 0750  2    Alton B. Parker of New York. There was a host of dark
G45 0760  1    horses. The sneers at Hearst changed to concern when
G45 0760 10    it was seen that he had strong support in many parts
G45 0770  8    of the country. Platoons of Hearst agents were traveling
G45 0780  4    from state to state in a surprisingly successful search
G45 0790  2    for delegates at the coming convention, and there were
G45 0790 11    charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading.
G45 0800 11    Just when it was needed for the campaign, Hearst Paper
G45 0810  9    No. 8, the Boston American, began publication. A Bay
G45 0820  5    State supporter said, "Mr. Hearst's fight has been
G45 0830  5    helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in
G45 0840  4    Boston". His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat.
G45 0850  1    He ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism
G45 0850 10    and to refrain from using such words as "seduction",
G45 0860  7    "rape", "abortion", "criminal assault" and "born out
G45 0870  6    of wedlock".
G45 0870  8       In a story headed, "HEARST OFFERS CASH", the Republican
G45 0880  9    New York Tribune spread the money rumor, quoting an
G45 0890  8    unnamed "Hearst supporter" as saying:
G45 0900  4       "The argument that is cutting most ice is that Hearst
G45 0910  5    is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly
G45 0920  2    and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt
G45 0930  1    them if he were elected. The Hearst men say that if
G45 0930 12    Hearst is nominated, he and his immediate friends will
G45 0940  7    contribute to the Democratic National Committee the
G45 0950  4    sum of $1,500,000. This, it is urged, would relieve
G45 0960  2    the national committee from the necessity of appealing
G45 0960 10    to the trust magnates. The alternative to this is that
G45 0970  9    if a conservative candidate is nominated the national
G45 0980  5    committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their
G45 0990  4    campaign funds, and in doing this will incur obligations
G45 1000  1    which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless
G45 1000  9    ... the average Democratic politician, especially
G45 1010  6    in the country districts, is hungry for the spoils
G45 1020  6    of office. It has been a long time since he has seen
G45 1030  4    any campaign money, and when the proposition is laid
G45 1030 13    down to him as the friends of Mr. Hearst are laying
G45 1040 11    it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard
G45 1050  8    the Hearst bandwagon".
G45 1050 11       If anything, the conservative Democrats were more
G45 1060  7    opposed to Hearst than the Republicans. In his own
G45 1070  6    state of New York, the two Democratic bellwethers,
G45 1080  2    State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy, were saying
G45 1090  2    nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting
G45 1090  9    their own favorites, Murphy being for Cleveland and
G45 1100  8    Hill for Parker. They had lost twice with the radical
G45 1110  7    Bryan, and were having no part of Hearst, whom they
G45 1120  4    considered more radical than Bryan. But his increasing
G45 1130  1    strength in the West looked menacing. It caused Henry
G45 1130 10    Watterson to sound a blast in his Louisville Courier-Journal:
G45 1160  1       "... Does any sane Democrat believe that Mr. Hearst,
G45 1160 10    a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues,
G45 1170  9    without a word or act in the public life of his country,
G45 1180  9    past or present, that can be shown to be his to commend
G45 1190  7    him, could by any possibility be elected President
G45 1200  1    of the United States? But there is a Hearst barrel
G45 1205  2    ..."
G45 1210  1       More splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee,
G45 1220  1    a Parker man. "... the nomination of Hearst would compass
G45 1220 11    the ruin of the party", Carmack said. "It would be
G45 1230  9    a disgrace, and, as I have already said to the people
G45 1240  7    of Tennessee, if Hearst is nominated, we may as well
G45 1250  5    pen a dispatch, and send it back from the field of
G45 1260  1    battle: 'All is lost, including our honor'".
G45 1260  8       A lone pro-Hearst voice from New York City was that
G45 1270 10    of William Devery, who had been expelled as a Tammany
G45 1280  8    leader but still claimed strong influence in his own
G45 1290  4    district. "I understand [Hearst] is a candidate for
G45 1300  2    Presidential honors", Devery said without cracking
G45 1300  8    a smile. "There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom
G45 1310  8    up. If he's going to the St. Louis convention as a
G45 1320  9    delegate we ought to know it. He's got a lot of friends,
G45 1330  7    and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants
G45 1340  5    our help".
G45 1340  7       Hearst won the Iowa state convention, but ran into
G45 1350  4    a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker,
G45 1360  1    drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W. Kern:
G45 1370  1       "We are menaced for the first time in the history
G45 1370 11    of the Republic by the open and unblushing effort of
G45 1380  8    a multi-millionaire to purchase the Presidential nomination.
G45 1390  4    Our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents
G45 1400  5    and retainers ... As for the paid Hessians from other
G45 1410  2    states, we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy
G45 1410 11    in their duty, I have nothing but contempt ... The
G45 1420  9    Hearst dollar mark is all over them ..."
G45 1430  1       The talk of a Hearst "barrel" was increasing. Another
G45 1440  2    Indiana observer later commented, "Perhaps we shall
G45 1450  1    never know how much was spent [by Hearst], but if as
G45 1450 12    much money was expended elsewhere as in Indiana a liberal
G45 1460  9    fortune was squandered".
G45 1470  1       In his fight for the Illinois and Indiana delegations,
G45 1480  1    Hearst made several trips to Chicago to confer with
G45 1480 10    Andrew Lawrence, the former San Francisco Examiner
G45 1490  6    man who was now his Chicago kingpin, and once to meet
G45 1500  6    with Bryan. On one visit he stopped at the office of
G45 1510  4    the American, where he was known surreptitiously as
G45 1520  1    "the Great White Chief", and for the first time met
G45 1520 11    his managing editor, fat Moses Koenigsberg. Koenigsberg
G45 1530  6    never did learn what Hearst wanted, for the latter
G45 1540  6    shook hands and moved toward the door.
G45 1550  1       "Never mind, thank you", he said. "I must hurry
G45 1550 10    to catch my train".
G45 1560  3       Another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle
G45 1570  1    of letters that had accumulated for him, saying, "But
G45 1570 10    Mr. Hearst, what shall I do with this correspondence"?
G45 1580  8       "I'll show you", Hearst replied, grinning. He took
G45 1590  8    the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket.
G45 1600  7    "Don't bother. Every letter answers itself in a couple
G45 1610  5    of weeks".
G45 1610  7    #II. THE HEARST "BARREL"#
G45 1620  1    HEARST hopped into a private railroad car with Max
G45 1620 10    Ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates
G45 1630  9    in the western and southern states, always wearing
G45 1640  5    a frock coat, listening intently to local politicians,
G45 1650  2    and generally making a good impression. He laughed
G45 1660  1    at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he
G45 1660 13    was not nominated.
G45 1670  1       "I should, of course", he said, "like any other
G45 1670 10    man, be honored and gratified should the Democrats
G45 1680  7    see fit to nominate me. But I do not have to be bribed
G45 1690  8    by office to be a Democrat. I have supported the Democratic
G45 1700  3    party in the last five campaigns. I supported Cleveland
G45 1710  2    three times and Bryan twice. I intend to support the
G45 1710 12    nominee of the party at St. Louis, whoever he may be".
G45 1720 11       The Hearst press followed the Chief's progress at
G45 1730  8    the various state conventions with its usual admiring
G45 1740  5    attention, stressing the "enthusiasm" and "loyalty"
G45 1750  3    he inspired. This was historic in its way, for it marked
G45 1760  3    the first time an American Presidential aspirant had
G45 1760 11    advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers
G45 1770 10    spanning the land.
G45 1780  1       Yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story
G45 1780 11    value. When Nan Patterson, a stunning and money-minded
G45 1790  9    chorus girl who had appeared in a Florodora road show,
G45 1800  8    rode down Broadway in a hansom cab with her married
G45 1810  5    lover, Frank Young, she stopped the cab to disclose
G45 1820  2    that Young had been shot dead, tearfully insisting
G45 1820 10    that he had shot himself although experts said he could
G45 1830  9    not have done so.
