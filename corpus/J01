J01 0010  1    #1. INTRODUCTION#
J01 0010  3    IT HAS recently become practical to use the radio emission
J01 0020  3    of the moon and planets as a new source of information
J01 0030  1    about these bodies and their atmospheres. The results
J01 0030  9    of present observations of the thermal radio emission
J01 0040  6    of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal
J01 0050  5    conductivity of the surface layer which was derived
J01 0060  1    from the variation in the infrared emission during
J01 0060  9    eclipses (e.g., Garstung, 1958). When sufficiently
J01 0070  5    accurate and complete measurements are available, it
J01 0080  4    will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical
J01 0090  3    characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials
J01 0100  1    of the moon.
J01 0100  4       Observations of the radio emission of a planet which
J01 0110  2    has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere
J01 0110 10    to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths
J01 0120  8    and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable
J01 0130  4    information about the characteristics of the solid
J01 0140  4    surface. Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have
J01 0150  1    already supplied unexpected experimental data on the
J01 0150  8    physical conditions of these planets. The observed
J01 0160  6    intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher
J01 0170  5    than the expected thermal intensity, although the spectrum
J01 0180  2    indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm
J01 0180 11    and 1o cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo`
J01 0190 13    K. This result suggests a very high temperature at
J01 0210  7    the solid surface of the planet, although there is
J01 0220  4    the possibility that the observed radiation may be
J01 0240  1    a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components
J01 0240 10    and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body
J01 0250  9    merely by coincidence. For the case of Jupiter, the
J01 0260  6    radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the
J01 0270  2    spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very
J01 0270 12    likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination
J01 0280  9    of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal
J01 0290  7    components.
J01 0290  8       Of the remaining planets, only Mars and Saturn have
J01 0300  7    been observed as radio sources, and not very much information
J01 0310  6    is available. Mars has been observed twice at about
J01 0320  4    3-cm wave length, and the intensity of the observed
J01 0330  1    radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal
J01 0330  9    radiation which might be predicted on the basis of
J01 0340  8    the known temperature of Mars. The low intensity of
J01 0350  5    the radiation from Saturn has limited observations,
J01 0360  1    but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent
J01 0360 10    with a thermal origin. No attempts to measure the radio
J01 0370  8    emission of the remaining planets have been reported,
J01 0380  5    and, because of their distances, small diameters, or
J01 0390  3    low temperatures, the thermal radiation at radio wave
J01 0390 11    lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected
J01 0400  9    to be of very low intensity. In spite of this, the
J01 0410  8    very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying
J01 0420  3    techniques which are now becoming available should
J01 0430  1    make it possible to observe the radio emission of most
J01 0430 11    of the planets in a few years.
J01 0440  5       The study of the radio emission of the moon and
J01 0450  2    planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation
J01 0450 11    of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer
J01 0460 10    (1946). This was followed by a comprehensive series
J01 0470  6    of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon
J01 0490  5    over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett (1949).
J01 0500  2    They deduced from their measurements that the radio
J01 0500 10    emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during
J01 0510 10    a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion; that the
J01 0520  5    amplitude of the variation was considerably less than
J01 0530  3    the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission
J01 0540  1    as measured by Pettit and Nicholson (1930) and Pettit
J01 0540 10    (1935); and that the maximum of the radio emission
J01 0550  9    came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon, which is again
J01 0570  5    in contrast to the infrared emission, which reaches
J01 0580  1    its maximum at Full Moon. Piddington and Minnett explained
J01 0590  1    their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials
J01 0590  9    which are likely to make up the surface of the moon
J01 0600  9    would be partially transparent to radio waves, although
J01 0610  5    opaque to infrared radiation. The infrared emission
J01 0620  2    could then be assumed to originate at the surface of
J01 0620 12    the moon, while the radio emission originates at some
J01 0630  8    depth beneath the surface, where the temperature variation
J01 0640  5    due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and
J01 0650  4    shifted in phase. Since the absorption of radio waves
J01 0660  1    in rocklike material varies with wave length, it should
J01 0660 10    be possible to sample the temperature variation at
J01 0670  7    different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect
J01 0680  4    changes in the structure or composition of the lunar
J01 0690  2    surface material.
J01 0690  4       The radio emission of a planet was first detected
J01 0700  3    in 1955, when Burke and Franklin (1955) identified
J01 0700 11    the origin of interference-like radio noise on their
J01 0710  9    records at about 15 meters wave length as emission
J01 0720  6    from Jupiter. This sporadic type of planetary radiation
J01 0730  3    is discussed by Burke (chap. 13) and Gallet (chap.
J01 0740  1    14). Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal
J01 0740  9    origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm,
J01 0750  9    and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 (Mayer,
J01 0760  7    McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958a, b, c), and from Saturn
J01 0770  6    at 3.75 cm in 1957 (Drake and Ewen, 1958). In the
J01 0780  4    relatively short time since these early observations,
J01 0800  1    Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths
J01 0800  9    in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm, and Jupiter has
J01 0810  8    been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03
J01 0820  4    to 68 cm.
J01 0820  7       The observable characteristics of planetary radio
J01 0830  3    radiation are the intensity, the polarization, and
J01 0830 10    the direction of arrival of the waves. The maximum
J01 0840  9    angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed
J01 0850  6    from the earth is about 1 minute of arc. This is much
J01 0860  4    smaller than the highest resolution of even the very
J01 0870  1    large reflectors now under construction, and consequently
J01 0870  8    the radio emission of different regions of the disk
J01 0880  7    cannot be resolved. It should be possible, however,
J01 0890  4    to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio
J01 0900  1    sources by observing with large reflectors or with
J01 0900  9    interferometers. Measurements of polarization are presently
J01 0910  6    limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult
J01 0920  5    because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation
J01 0930  3    at the earth. There have been few measurements specifically
J01 0940  1    for the determination of the polarization of planetary
J01 0940  9    radiation. The measurements made with the NRL 50-foot
J01 0950  9    reflector, which is altitude-azimuth-mounted, would
J01 0960  7    have shown a systematic change with local hour angle
J01 0970  5    in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if
J01 0980  2    a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly
J01 0980 11    polarized. Recent interferometer measurements (Radhakrishnan
J01 0990  5    and Roberts, 1960) have shown the 960-Mc emission
J01 1000  8    of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate
J01 1020  4    in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk.
J01 1030  2    Other than this very significant result, most of the
J01 1030 11    information now available about the radio emission
J01 1040  7    of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the
J01 1050  6    radiation.
J01 1050  7       The concept of apparent black-body temperature is
J01 1060  5    used to describe the radiation received from the moon
J01 1070  3    and the planets. The received radiation is compared
J01 1070 11    with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which
J01 1080  8    subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of
J01 1090  7    the planet. The apparent black-body disk temperature
J01 1100  3    is the temperature which must be assumed for the black
J01 1110  2    body in order that the intensity of its radiation should
J01 1110 12    equal that of the observed radiation. The use of this
J01 1120  9    concept does not specify the origin of the radiation,
J01 1130  6    and only if the planet really radiates as a black body,
J01 1140  5    will the apparent black-body temperature correspond
J01 1150  1    to the physical temperature of the emitting material.
J01 1150  9       The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected
J01 1160  8    from the moon and planets should be negligible compared
J01 1170  4    with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths,
J01 1180  3    except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of
J01 1180 11    solar radio noise. The quiescent level of centimeter
J01 1190  8    wave-length solar radiation would increase the average
J01 1200  5    disk brightness temperature by less than 1` K. At
J01 1210  5    meter wave lengths and increase of the order of 10`
J01 1220  2    K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets
J01 1220 12    would be expected. Therefore, neglecting the extreme
J01 1240  7    outbursts, reflected solar radiation is not expected
J01 1250  6    to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary
J01 1260  3    radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length
J01 1270  1    range.
J01 1270  2    #2. THE MOON#
J01 1270  5    _2.1 OBSERVATIONS_
J01 1270  7       Radio observations of the moon have been made over
J01 1280  8    the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm, and
J01 1290  5    the results are summarized in Table 1. Observations
J01 1300  1    have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques
J01 1300 11    (Sinton, 1955, 1956,; see also chap. 11). Not all the
J01 1310 10    observers have used the same procedures or made the
J01 1320  7    same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution
J01 1330  2    when reducing the data, and this, together with differences
J01 1340  2    in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers,
J01 1350  1    must account for much of the disagreement in the measured
J01 1350 11    radio brightness temperatures.
J01 1360  2       In the observations at 4.3 mm (Coates, 1959a),
J01 1370  2    the diameter of the antenna beam, 6'.7, was small enough
J01 1380  1    to allow resolution of some of the larger features
J01 1380 10    of the lunar surface, and contour diagrams have been
J01 1390  6    made of the lunar brightness distribution at three
J01 1400  3    lunar phases. These observations indicate that the
J01 1400 10    lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off
J01 1410 10    more rapidly than do the mountainous regions. Mare
J01 1420  5    Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler
J01 1430  3    than the regions which surround it. These contour diagrams
J01 1440  1    also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness
J01 1440 11    with latitude.
J01 1450  2       Very recently, observations have been made at 8-mm
J01 1460  1    wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter
J01 1460 10    with a resultant beam width of only about 2' (Amenitskii,
J01 1470  8    Noskova, and Salomonovich, 1960). The constant-temperature
J01 1480  5    contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3
J01 1490  4    mm by Coates (1959a), and apparently the emission
J01 1500  1    at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences
J01 1500 11    in surface features. Such high-resolution observations
J01 1510  6    as these are needed at several wave lengths in order
J01 1520  5    that the radio emission of the moon can be properly
J01 1540  1    interpreted.
J01 1540  2       The observations of Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker
J01 1550  3    at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously
J01 1560  1    been published and will be briefly described. Measurements
J01 1570  1    at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the
J01 1570 12    interval May 3 to June 19, 1956, using the 50-foot
J01 1580  9    reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in
J01 1590  4    Washington. The half-intensity diameter of the antenna
J01 1600  4    beam was about 9', and the angle subtended by the moon
J01 1610  1    included the entire main beam and part of the first
J01 1610 11    side lobes. The antenna patterns and the power gain
J01 1620  7    at the peak of the beam were both measured (Mayer,
J01 1630  3    McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958b), so that the absolute
J01 1650  2    power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid
J01 1650 11    angle of the moon was known. The ratio of the measured
J01 1660 11    antenna temperature change during a drift scan across
J01 1670  7    the moon to the average brightness temperature of the
J01 1680  3    moon over the antenna beam (assuming that the brightness
J01 1690  1    temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by
J01 1690 10    graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram,
J01 1710  6    to be 0.85. The measured brightness temperature is
J01 1720  4    a good approximation to the brightness temperature
J01 1730  1    at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow
J01 1730 12    antenna beam and because the temperature distribution
J01 1740  7    over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly
J01 1750  7    uniform. The result of the observations is (in ` K)
J01 1760  5    **f where the phase angle, |qt, is measured in degrees
J01 1770  3    from new moon and the probable errors include absolute
J01 1780  1    as well as relative errors. This result is plotted
J01 1780 10    along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson (1958)
J01 1790  5    in figure 1, a. The variation in the 3-cm emission
J01 1810  6    of the moon during a lunation is very much less than
J01 1820  3    the variation in the 8.6-mm emission, as would be
J01 1820 13    expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett
J01 1830  8    (1949). In the discussion which follows, the time average
J01 1840  6    of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant
J01 1850  6    component, and the superimposed periodic variation
J01 1860  2    will be called the variable component.
J01 1860  8       The 10.3-cm observation of Sloanaker was made on
J01 1870  7    May 20, 1958, using the 84-foot reflector at the Maryland
J01 1880  7    Point Observatory of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory.
J01 1890  5    The age of the moon was about 2 days. The half-intensity
J01 1900  5    diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about
J01 1910  2    18'.5, and the brightness temperature was reduced by
J01 1910 10    assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and
J01 1920  9    a uniformly bright disk for the moon.
