A32 0010  1       Enrique Jorda, conductor and musical director of
A32 0010  8    the San Francisco Symphony, will fulfill two more guest
A32 0020  7    conducting engagements in Europe before returning home
A32 0030  6    to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season, it
A32 0040  3    was announced.
A32 0040  5       The guest assignments are scheduled for November
A32 0050  3    14 and 18, with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in
A32 0060  2    Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne. The season
A32 0060 11    in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert
A32 0070  9    on November 22.
A32 0080  1       During his five-month visit abroad, Jorda recently
A32 0080  9    conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique de Bordeau in
A32 0090  7    France, and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome.
A32 0100  5       In announcing Jorda's return, the orchestra also
A32 0110  4    announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th
A32 0120  2    anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box
A32 0120 11    office on Wednesday.
A32 0130  2       Guest performers and conductors during the coming
A32 0140  1    season will include many renowned artists who began
A32 0140  9    their careers playing with the orchestra, including
A32 0150  5    violinists Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Ruggiero Ricci
A32 0160  4    and David Abel; pianists Leon Fleisher, Ruth Slenczynka
A32 0170  3    and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray.
A32 0190  1       The Leningrad Kirov Ballet, which opened a series
A32 0190  9    of performances Friday night at the Opera House, is,
A32 0200  8    I think, the finest "classical" ballet company I have
A32 0210  5    ever seen, and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky
A32 0220  4    "Sleeping Beauty" with which it began the series is
A32 0230  4    incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure
A32 0230 13    of witnessing.
A32 0240  2       This work is no favorite of mine. I am prepared
A32 0250  1    to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit
A32 0250 11    of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and
A32 0260  8    reactionary aspect; that its persistent use by ballet
A32 0270  6    companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that
A32 0280  3    old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it
A32 0280 13    ever was; that its presentation in this country is
A32 0290  8    part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people;
A32 0300  6    that its choreography is undistinguished and its score
A32 0310  4    a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms. All of
A32 0320  2    this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in
A32 0320 13    the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation.
A32 0330  6    #PRECISE#
A32 0330  7    The reasons for this enchantment are numerous, but
A32 0340  7    most of them end in "ova", "eva", or "aya". In other
A32 0350  6    words, no merely male creature can resist that corps
A32 0360  5    de ballet. It seems to have been chosen exclusively
A32 0370  1    from the winners of beauty contests- Miss Omsk, Miss
A32 0370 10    Pinsk, Miss Stalingr ... oops, skip it.
A32 0380  7       These qualities alone, however, would not account
A32 0390  5    for their success, and it took me a while to discover
A32 0400  2    the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective
A32 0410  1    personality. It is a kind of friendliness and frankness
A32 0410 10    of address toward the audience which we have been led
A32 0420  9    to believe was peculiar to the American ballet.
A32 0430  4    Oh-the-pain-of-it,
A32 0430  9    that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls
A32 0440  5    convey the idea that they are all the daughters of
A32 0450  2    impoverished Grand Dukes driven to thestage out of
A32 0450 10    filial piety, is totally absent from the Kirov. This
A32 0460  8    is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to
A32 0470  6    ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics.
A32 0480  2    But, obviously, at least some things have changed for
A32 0490  1    the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.
A32 0490 12       Irina Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's
A32 0500  7    performance, would be a change for the better anywhere,
A32 0510  8    at any time, no matter who had had the role before.
A32 0520  4    She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes
A32 0530  1    on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness,
A32 0530 10    sparkle, and refinement which are simply incomparable.
A32 0540  5    #HIT#
A32 0540  6    Alla Sizova, who seems to have made a special hit in
A32 0550  9    the East, was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her
A32 0560  4    partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully virile, acrobatic,
A32 0570  2    and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not
A32 0570 13    unlike that of Nijinsky. Vladilen Semenov, a fine "danseur
A32 0580  9    noble"; Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer;
A32 0590  7    and Inna Zubkovskaya, an excellent Lilac Fairy, were
A32 0600  6    other outstanding members of the cast, but every member
A32 0610  5    of the cast was magnificent.
A32 0610 10       The production, designed by Simon Virsaladze, was
A32 0620  6    completely traditional but traditional in the right
A32 0630  5    way. It was done with great taste, was big and spacious,
A32 0640  2    sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly
A32 0640 12    costumes, but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style,
A32 0650  9    with rich, quiet harmonies of color between the costumes
A32 0660  6    themselves and between the costumes and the scenery.
A32 0670  4       Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large
A32 0680  2    orchestra, one containing excellent soloists- the violin
A32 0690  1    solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially
A32 0690  9    fine- but one in which the core of traveling players
A32 0700  8    and the body of men added locally had not had time
A32 0710  5    to achieve much unity.
A32 0720  1       Mail orders are now being received for the series
A32 0720 10    of concerts to be given this season under the auspices
A32 0730  9    of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society.
A32 0740  3       The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers
A32 0750  2    in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p. m. with
A32 0760  1    a concert by the Mills Chamber Players.
A32 0760  8       Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert
A32 0770 10    season; annual members may attend for $16. Participating
A32 0780  5    members may attend five of the concerts for $9 (not
A32 0800  4    all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier
A32 0800 12    in The Chronicle).
A32 0810  2       Mail orders for the season and orders for single
A32 0820  1    tickets at $2, may be addressed to the society, 1044
A32 0820 11    Chestnut street, San Francisco 9.
A32 0840  1       San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week
A32 0840  8    with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys
A32 0850  8    for distribution to needy children.
A32 0860  1       Fire Fighters Local 798, which is sponsoring the
A32 0860  9    toy program for the 12th straight year, issued a call
A32 0870  9    for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys, which
A32 0880  7    will be repaired by off-duty firemen.
A32 0890  1       Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year.
A32 0890 10    They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View
A32 0900 10    Federal Savings and Loan Association, at a collection
A32 0910  6    center in the center of the Stonestown mall, and at
A32 0920  4    the Junior Museum, 16th street and Roosevelt way.
A32 0930  1       From the collection centers, toys will be taken
A32 0930  9    to a warehouse at 198 Second street, where they will
A32 0940  8    be repaired and made ready for distribution.
A32 0950  3       Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain
A32 0960  2    toys by writing to Christmas Toys, 676 Howard street,
A32 0960 11    San Francisco 5, and listing the parent's name and
A32 0970  9    address and the age and sex of each child in the family
A32 0980  9    between the ages of 1 and 12. Requests must be mailed
A32 0990  4    in by December 5. Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his
A32 1000  7    instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday
A32 1010  5    and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal. He
A32 1020  2    was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow
A32 1020 13    night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin. President
A32 1030  9    Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said,
A32 1040  8    "We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest
A32 1050  8    artists would lend distinction to the entertainment
A32 1060  4    of our guests".
A32 1070  1       FOR A GOOD MANY SEASONS I've been looking at the
A32 1070 11    naughty stuff on television, so the other night I thought
A32 1080 10    I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other
A32 1090  8    side of the fence in movies. After all, this year's
A32 1100  4    movies are next year's television shows.
A32 1110  1       So I went to see "La Dolce Vita".
A32 1110  9       It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality.
A32 1120  7    All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected
A32 1130  6    into this three-hour film. If that's all the Romans
A32 1140  4    did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell.
A32 1150  1       After television, "La Dolce Vita" seems as harmless
A32 1150  8    as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night. I cannot
A32 1160 10    imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier
A32 1170  8    manner on TV every week.
A32 1180  1       I believe TV watchers will be bored.
A32 1180  8       "La Dolce Vita" has none of the senseless brutality
A32 1190  8    or sadism of the average TV Western. Week in, week
A32 1200  6    out, there is more sex to be seen in "The Adventures
A32 1210  4    of Ozzie and Harriet". There is more decadence on "77
A32 1220  3    Sunset Strip". There are more obvious nymphomaniacs
A32 1230  1    on any private-eye series.
A32 1230  6    #@#
A32 1230  7    IN ANOTHER RESPECT, television viewers will feel right
A32 1240  6    at home because most of the actors are unknowns. With
A32 1250  4    the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg, the credits
A32 1260  3    are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge
A32 1270  1    Theater.
A32 1270  2       Most of the emphasis has been placed on a "wild
A32 1280  1    party" at a seaside villa. Producer Fellini should
A32 1280  9    have looked at some of the old silent films where they
A32 1290  9    really had PARTIES! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted
A32 1300  7    a strip tease (carried as far as a black slip); a lady
A32 1310  8    drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around
A32 1320  4    on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her
A32 1330  1    face; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.
A32 1330  9       Put them all together and they spell out the only
A32 1340  8    four-letter word I can think of: dull.
A32 1350  2       Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties
A32 1360  1    had begun to pall. What a swinging group they must
A32 1360 11    have been when they first started entertaining!
A32 1370  5    #@#
A32 1370  6    AS A MORAL SHOCKER it is a dud. But this doesn't detract
A32 1380  9    from its merit as an interesting, if not great, film.
A32 1390  6    The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly:
A32 1400  5       "This is a long picture and a controversial one,
A32 1410  2    but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking
A32 1420  1    description of humans who have become unlinked from
A32 1420  9    life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political,
A32 1430  7    cultural and religious glories".
A32 1440  2       And when they sell it to television in a couple
A32 1450  1    of years, it can be shown without editing.

A32 1610  1       THE WEEK WENT along briskly enough. I bought a new
A32 1610 11    little foreign bomb. It is a British bomb. Very austere
A32 1620 10    yet racy.
A32 1630  1       It is very chic to drive foreign cars. With a foreign
A32 1630 12    car you must wear a cap- it has a leather band in the
A32 1640 11    back. You must also wear a car coat.
A32 1650  4       The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive.
A32 1660  1    But we couldn't really get along without it.

A32 1660 10    "WHERE DO YOU put the lighter fluid, ha, ha"? asked
A32 1670 10    the gas station man. The present crop of small cars
A32 1680  8    is enriching American humor.
A32 1690  1       Gas station people are very debonair about small
A32 1690  9    cars.
A32 1700  1       When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty
A32 1700 11    status at the wind-and-water oases. My car gulped 20
A32 1710  6    gallons without even wiping its mouth.
A32 1720  1       This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.
A32 1720  8       When I had my big job with the double headlights
A32 1730 10    and yards of chrome, the gas people were happy to see
A32 1740  7    me.
A32 1740  8       "Tires OK? Check the oil and water, sir?"
A32 1750  6       They polished the windshield. They had a loving
A32 1760  5    touch.
A32 1760  6    #@#
A32 1760  7    THE MAN STUCK the nozzle in the gas tank. "What kind
A32 1770  7    of car is it"? he asked gloomily.
A32 1780  1       "It is a British Austin, the smallest they make".
A32 1790  1       "Get much mileage"?
A32 1790  3       "About 35".
A32 1790  5       The gas station man sighed unhappily.
A32 1800  4       "What I always say is what if somebody clobbers
A32 1810  3    you in a little car like that? Crunch, that's all she
A32 1820  2    wrote".
A32 1820  3       "I will die rich".
A32 1820  7       "That will be $1.80", said the gas station man.
A32 1830  7    "The windshield looks pretty clean".

A32 1840  3    AH, THE FAIR-WEATHER friends of yesteryear! When I
A32 1850  3    wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling
A32 1850 13    of the doormen. Dollar bills skidded off my hands and
A32 1860  9    they tipped their caps politely.
A32 1870  2       With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs.
A32 1880  1    (The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself.
A32 1880 12    High blood pressure can get the best of any of us.)
