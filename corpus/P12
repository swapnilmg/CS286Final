P12 0010  1    "I had a rather small place of my own. A nice bachelor
P12 0010 13    apartment in a place called the Lancaster Arms".
P12 0020  7       "Uhhu", she said, hardly listening as she studied
P12 0030  6    her left eyelid.
P12 0030  9       "And then I had another place farther downtown I
P12 0040  8    used as a studio".
P12 0050  1       "Uhhu".
P12 0050  2       "I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends,
P12 0060  1    Carla", he said, wanting her to know all about him.
P12 0060 11    "Oh, I'd drink with newspaper people. I think I was
P12 0070 10    what you might call a convivial man, and yet it was
P12 0080  8    when I was alone in my studio, doing my work, that
P12 0090  4    I really felt alive. But I think a man needs at least
P12 0100  1    one intimate friend to communicate with". Pausing,
P12 0100  8    he waited for her to turn, to ask a question. She showed
P12 0110 10    no interest at all in the life he had led back home,
P12 0120  7    and it hurt him a little. "Well, what about you, Carla"?
P12 0130  4       "Me"? she asked, turning slowly. "What about me"?
P12 0140  4       "Did you make friends easily"?
P12 0150  1       "Umm, uhhu".
P12 0150  3       "Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were
P12 0160  4    alone a lot. How about it"?
P12 0160 10       "I guess so", she said taking a Kleenex from her
P12 0170  8    purse. When she had wiped some of the lipstick from
P12 0180  5    her mouth, she stared solemnly at her image in the
P12 0190  1    mirror.
P12 0190  2       "Are your people still alive"? he asked, trying
P12 0200  1    to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed;
P12 0200 11    so he could have something of her for himself. "You
P12 0210  8    talk so well, Carla", he went on. "You seem to have
P12 0220  8    read so much, you have a natural gift for words", he
P12 0230  4    added, trying to flatter her vanity. "You must have
P12 0240  1    been good at history at school. Where did you go to
P12 0240 12    school"?
P12 0250  1       "What is this"? she asked, turning suddenly. "Don't
P12 0260  1    you know all about me by this time? My name's Carla
P12 0260 12    Caneli. This is my town. I sleep with you. You know
P12 0270 10    something more about me every day, don't you? Would
P12 0280  5    you be happier if I made up some stories about my life,
P12 0290  4    told you some lies? Why are you trying to worry me"?
P12 0300  2       "I'm not trying to worry you".
P12 0300  8       "Well, all right then".
P12 0310  4       The cleansing tissues she had been using had been
P12 0320  2    falling on the floor, and he got up and picked up one,
P12 0320 14    then another, hoping she would notice what he was doing.
P12 0330  9    At home he had been a clean orderly man, and now he
P12 0340  8    had to hide his annoyance. Was she just naturally sloppy
P12 0350  3    about everything but her physical appearance? he wondered.
P12 0360  2    Would he have to clean up after her every day, clean
P12 0360 13    the kitchen, the bathroom, and get down on his knees
P12 0370 10    and scrub the kitchen floor, then hang up her dresses,
P12 0380  7    pick up her stockings, make the bed while she lay around?
P12 0390  5    He straightened up, ready to vent his exasperation,
P12 0400  1    then grew afraid. If he dwelt on the indignities he
P12 0400 11    suffered he would lose all respect for her, and without
P12 0410 10    the respect he might lose his view of her, too.
P12 0420  6       "What's the matter"? she asked suddenly.
P12 0430  2       "Nothing. Nothing at all", he said quietly. "Let's
P12 0440  1    go out".
P12 0440  3       "Are those the only shoes you have, Sam"?
P12 0450  1       "What's the matter with them"?
P12 0450  6       "The heavy thick soles. Look at them".
P12 0460  7       "They're an expensive English shoe for walking around
P12 0470  6    a lot. I like them".
P12 0470 11       "Sam, no one around here wears such heavy soles.
P12 0480  9    Can't you get another pair"?
P12 0490  2       "Maybe I could", he said, surprised that she could
P12 0500  2    turn from herself and notice anything about him. "I'll
P12 0500 11    get an elegant pair of thin-soled Italian shoes tomorrow,
P12 0510 10    Carla".
P12 0520  1       "And I don't know why you want to go on wearing
P12 0520 12    that outfit", she said, making a face.
P12 0530  6       "What's the matter with it"? He had put on the gray
P12 0540  7    jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored
P12 0550  3    shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he
P12 0550 14    had encountered her on the street.
P12 0560  6       "Oh, Sam. You look like a tweedy Englishman. Can't
P12 0570  3    you wear something else and look a little more as though
P12 0580  4    you belonged"?
P12 0580  6       "I don't mind at all", he said, delighted with her
P12 0590  6    attention. Changing his clothes, he put on his dark-blue
P12 0600  5    flannel suit, and laid away the gray jacket with the
P12 0610  1    feeling that he might be putting it aside for good.
P12 0610 11    But it was a hopeful sign, he told himself. She no
P12 0620  7    longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the
P12 0630  5    circumstances of their meeting that first night in
P12 0640  1    Parioli.
P12 0640  2       That day they loafed around, just getting the feel
P12 0650  1    of the city. They looked at the ruins of the old Roman
P12 0650 13    wall on the lower Via Veneto, then they went to the
P12 0660  8    Farnese Gardens. She had some amusing scandal about
P12 0670  4    the Farneses in the old days. Then they took a taxi
P12 0680  3    to Trastevere. "There's a church you should see", she
P12 0690  1    said. And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza
P12 0690 12    looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face,
P12 0700 10    not letting on he had been there with Alberto. He let
P12 0710  6    her tell him all about the church. Then they had dinner.
P12 0720  4    All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself.
P12 0730  1    When they got home at midnight she was tired out. And
P12 0730 12    in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells
P12 0740 10    were ringing.
P12 0740 12       He had never heard so many bells, and as he lay
P12 0750 11    there listening, he thought of her scolding him for
P12 0760  6    his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and
P12 0770  3    the church at the top of the Spanish Steps. It was
P12 0770 14    a good thing that she clung to her religion, he thought.
P12 0780 10    She might like to take him to St. Peter's.
P12 0790  6       "Carla, wake up", he said shaking her. "It's ten
P12 0800  5    o'clock. Aren't you going out to mass? You could take
P12 0810  4    me to St. Peter's".
P12 0810  8       "Uhhu", she muttered.
P12 0820  2       "Come on, you'll be late".
P12 0820  7       "I think I'll sleep in this morning", she said drowsily,
P12 0830  9    and as she snuggled against him, he wondered if she
P12 0840  7    ever went to church. Why did he want her to go to church?
P12 0850  7    he wondered ... Probably because it was a place where
P12 0860  4    she might get a feeling of certainty and security.
P12 0860 13    It would be good for her. It was too bad he had no
P12 0870 12    feeling himself for church. Not his poor mother's fault.
P12 0880  6    She would have been better off if she had stuck to
P12 0890  6    her Bible. As for himself, he just didn't have the
P12 0900  2    temperament for it. From the time he had been at college
P12 0900 13    he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure
P12 0910  7    by accepting the fact that there were certain things
P12 0920  5    he could never know. Then he thought of those Old Testament
P12 0930  3    figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Just
P12 0940  1    figures out of a tribal folklore. Could he honestly
P12 0940 10    believe it would be good for Carla to have those old
P12 0950  9    prophets gripping her imagination now? Being a woman
P12 0960  5    though, she would take only what she needed from church.
P12 0970  3    It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself. Or a Protestant,
P12 0980  2    or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists, or a strict
P12 0980 12    orthodox Communist. What was the matter with him that
P12 0990  9    they all wearied him? It was the times, he was sure.
P12 1000  9    All the ideologies changing from day to day, right
P12 1010  5    under his eyes, so how could a man look to any one
P12 1020  1    of them for an enlargement of his freedom? It was all
P12 1020 12    too wearying. Look somewhere else. But where? Just
P12 1030  7    the same, he thought, pondering over it, it would be
P12 1040  6    a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and
P12 1050  4    went to church.
P12 1050  7       A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast
P12 1060  5    so the Ferraros, hearing them hurrying down the stairs,
P12 1070  2    would think they were going to a late mass. It seemed
P12 1070 13    to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them, could
P12 1080 10    place them, it would help him to feel more sure of
P12 1090  8    himself with Carla.
P12 1090 11       "Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon",
P12 1100  7    he said, "I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay
P12 1110  9    her to come in every day to clean for us". And he waited
P12 1120  6    for her to say, "Oh, no, I can do it, Sam. There's
P12 1130  3    so little to do".
P12 1130  7       "Why not"? she said. "I'm not good at that kind
P12 1140  7    of thing".
P12 1140  9       "This afternoon let's take an air with them. Let's
P12 1150  8    be fine superior people of great dignity", he said
P12 1160  5    as if he were joking.
P12 1160 10       "If you find it necessary, Sam, go ahead", she said,
P12 1170  9    turning on the stair. "I am what I am. I can't help
P12 1180  9    it". Her words remained with him, worrying him for
P12 1190  5    hours. He didn't know how she would behave with other
P12 1200  2    people.
P12 1200  3       When they walked into the Ferraro apartment, the
P12 1210  2    old lady, bowing and smiling, said softly. "Ciao,"
P12 1210 10    and put out her hand. Her little brown face wrinkled
P12 1220  9    up, her brown eyes gleamed, and with her little gestures
P12 1230  6    she said all the courteous things. Agnese, smiling
P12 1240  2    too, said, "'Ello", and then more slowly, "I am happy".
P12 1250  3    And they sat down and began their little coffee party.
P12 1260  1    The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee.
P12 1260  9    Acting only as interpreter Carla, her hands folded
P12 1270  6    on her lap, was utterly impersonal. She would turn
P12 1280  4    to them, then turn to him, then turn again. Watching
P12 1290  1    her, he felt like a spectator at a tennis game, with
P12 1290 12    the ball being bounced back and forth. Signora Ferraro,
P12 1300  7    bobbing her head encouragingly, asked Sam about Canada,
P12 1310  5    having a special interest. Carla translated. The old
P12 1320  3    woman had a nephew from North Italy, a poor boy from
P12 1330  1    a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment,
P12 1330 12    and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway.
P12 1340 10    For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar.
P12 1350  9    Did many of Sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the
P12 1360  5    bush? Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar? she wanted to
P12 1370  3    know. Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience
P12 1380  1    with boxcars. Just the same, the old woman said, she
P12 1380 11    would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him
P12 1390  8    she had met a nice man from his adopted country. And
P12 1400  3    Sam thanked her, and hoped he might meet her nephew
P12 1410  1    back home, and asked her if she had any further news
P12 1410 12    of the Pope.
P12 1420  1       A very great Pope, this one, the old woman explained,
P12 1420 11    her black eyes sparkling. An intellectual. But very
P12 1430  7    mystical too. It was said that he had had a vision.
P12 1440  8    Just as thousands that day in Portugal had seen the
P12 1450  4    sun dancing in the sky, he had seen the same thing
P12 1450 15    later in his own garden, and she turned to Agnese for
P12 1460 11    confirmation. Agnese had been sitting quietly, listening
P12 1470  6    with the serenity of the unaware. Now a little flush
P12 1480  5    came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her
P12 1490  2    eyes. The Holy Father would die soon, she said to Carla,
P12 1490 13    so she could translate for Sam, although he had a brilliant
P12 1500 10    doctor, a man who did not need the assistance of those
P12 1510  9    doctors offered by the great rulers of the world. Yes,
P12 1520  6    the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint. No,
P12 1530  3    he was indeed a saint now. Nodding approvingly and
P12 1530 12    swelling with importance, the old lady whispered confidentially.
P12 1540  8    There was a certain discontent among the cardinals.
P12 1550  7    The Pope, in the splendor of his great intellect, had
P12 1560  6    neglected them a little. There would be changes made,
P12 1570  2    and Signor Raymond should understand that when the
P12 1570 10    Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome.
P12 1580 12    Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent.
P12 1590  6       Did Signor Raymond understand? Indeed he did, Sam
P12 1600  5    said solemnly, trying to get Carla's eye. Surely she
P12 1610  4    could see that these women were her Italians, too,
P12 1620  1    he thought. Devout, orthodox and plain like a family
P12 1620 10    she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland. But
P12 1630  7    Carla; eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening
P12 1640  6    eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness. And Carla,
P12 1650  3    watching in wonder, turned to Sam. "It means so much
P12 1660  3    to her. It's like a flame, I guess", she said in a
P12 1660 15    dreamy tone.
