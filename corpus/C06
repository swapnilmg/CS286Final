C06 0010  1       George Kennan's account of relations between Russia
C06 0010  8    and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of
C06 0020 11    World War II is the finest piece of diplomatic history
C06 0030  6    that has appeared in many years. It combines qualities
C06 0040  4    that are seldom found in one work: Scrupulous scholarship,
C06 0050  2    a fund of personal experience, a sense of drama and
C06 0050 12    characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great
C06 0060  9    historical issues.
C06 0080  1       In short, the book, based largely on lectures delivered
C06 0080 10    at Harvard University, is both reliable and readable;
C06 0090  7    the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style,
C06 0100  6    and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance
C06 0110  4    that are highly topical for our time. If Mr. Kennan
C06 0120  2    is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals, if
C06 0120 11    his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge
C06 0130  8    of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often
C06 0140  6    critical and pessimistic- well, the record itself is
C06 0150  4    not too encouraging.
C06 0150  7       Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating
C06 0160  5    circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere
C06 0170  2    in which mistaken decisions were taken. But he rejects,
C06 0180  1    perhaps a little too sweepingly, the theory that disloyal
C06 0180 10    and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to
C06 0190  6    the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until
C06 0200  4    after the end of the war and reached its high point
C06 0210  2    at the Yalta Conference in February, 1945.
C06 0210  9       After all, Alger Hiss, subsequently convicted of
C06 0220  6    perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department
C06 0230  5    documents to Soviet agents, was at Yalta. And Harry
C06 0240  3    Dexter White, implicated in F.B.I. reports in Communist
C06 0250  3    associations, was one of the architects of the Morgenthau
C06 0260  1    Plan, which had it ever been put into full operation,
C06 0260 11    would have simply handed Germany to Stalin. One item
C06 0270  8    in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed
C06 0280  5    exclusively by its continental neighbors, among whom
C06 0290  3    only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength.
C06 0290 11       It is quite probable, however, that stupidity, inexperience
C06 0300  9    and childish adherence to slogans like "unconditional
C06 0310  7    surrender" had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements
C06 0320  8    at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with
C06 0330  5    Communism. Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what
C06 0340  3    went wrong this way:
C06 0340  7    #DASHED HOPE#
C06 0340  9    "You see, first of all and in a sense as the source
C06 0350 11    of all other ills, the unshakeable American commitment
C06 0360  3    to the principle of unconditional surrender: The tendency
C06 0370  3    to view any war in which we might be involved not as
C06 0380  1    a means of achieving limited objectives in the way
C06 0380 10    of changes in a given status quo, but as a struggle
C06 0390  7    to the death between total virtue and total evil, with
C06 0400  4    the result that the war had absolutely to be fought
C06 0410  1    to the complete destruction of the enemy's power, no
C06 0410 10    matter what disadvantages or complications this might
C06 0420  5    involve for the more distant future".
C06 0430  2       Recognizing that there could have been no effective
C06 0440  1    negotiated peace with Hitler, he points out the shocking
C06 0440 10    failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground,
C06 0450  8    which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944. A veteran
C06 0460  6    diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian
C06 0470  3    language, history and literature, Kennan recalls how,
C06 0470 10    at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union
C06 0480 10    in 1941, he penned a private note to a State Department
C06 0490  8    official, expressing the hope that "never would we
C06 0500  5    associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas
C06 0510  3    of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries".
C06 0510 10       The hope was vain. With justified bitterness the
C06 0520  8    author speaks of "what seems to me to have been an
C06 0530  8    inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the
C06 0540  4    Russian Communist movement, about the history of its
C06 0550  1    diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and
C06 0550 10    about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic
C06 0560  9    States". He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
C06 0570  4    "puerile" assumption that "if only he (Stalin) could
C06 0580  4    be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like
C06 0590  2    F.D.R. himself, ideological preconceptions would melt
C06 0590  8    and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily
C06 0600 10    arranged".
C06 0610  1       No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President
C06 0610  8    Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the
C06 0620 10    "good old days" of Roosevelt.
C06 0630  1       This fascinating story begins with a sketch, rich
C06 0630  9    in personal detail, of the glancing mutual impact of
C06 0640  9    World War I and the two instalments of the Russian
C06 0650  7    Revolution. The first of these involved the replacement
C06 0660  4    of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in
C06 0670  2    March, 1917; the second, the seizure of power by the
C06 0670 12    Bolsheviks (who later called themselves Communists)
C06 0680  6    in November of the same year.
C06 0690  3       As Kennan shows, the judgment of the Allied governments
C06 0700  1    about what was happening in Russia was warped by the
C06 0700 11    obsession of defeating Germany. They were blind to
C06 0710  8    the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people
C06 0720  6    fighting. They attributed everything that went wrong
C06 0730  4    in Russia to German influence and intrigue. This, more
C06 0740  2    than any other factor, led to the fiasco of Allied
C06 0740 12    intervention. As the author very justly says:
C06 0750  7       "Had a world war not been in progress, there would
C06 0760  5    never, under any conceivable stretch of the imagination,
C06 0770  2    have been an Allied intervention in North Russia".
C06 0780  1    The scope and significance of this intervention have
C06 0780  9    been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda; here
C06 0790  5    Kennan, operating with precise facts and figures, performs
C06 0800  5    an excellent job of debunking.
C06 0800 10    #PLEBIAN DICTATORS#
C06 0810  2    Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's
C06 0820  1    vivid style, the characterizations of the two plebeian
C06 0820  9    dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats
C06 0830  8    pale by comparison may be selected. On Stalin:
C06 0840  5       "This was a man of incredible criminality, of a
C06 0850  3    criminality effectively without limits; a man apparently
C06 0860  1    foreign to the very experience of love, without mercy
C06 0860 10    or pity; a man in whose entourage none was ever safe;
C06 0870 10    a man whose hand was set against all that could not
C06 0880  6    be useful to him at the moment; a man who was most
C06 0890  3    dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators
C06 0900  1    in crime ...".
C06 0900  4       And here is Kennan's image of Hitler, Stalin's temporary
C06 0910  2    collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker
C06 0920  2    peoples, and his later enemy:
C06 0920  7       "Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that
C06 0930  5    truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead,
C06 0940  3    behind the tirades and the sulky silences, the passionate
C06 0950  1    orations and the occasional dull evasive stare, behind
C06 0950  9    the prejudices, the cynicism, the total amorality of
C06 0960  7    behavior, behind even the tendency to great strategic
C06 0970  4    mistakes, there lay a statesman of no mean qualities:
C06 0980  1    Shrewd, calculating, in many ways realistic, endowed-
C06 0980  8    like Stalin- with considerable powers of dissimulation,
C06 0990  6    capable of playing his cards very close to his chest
C06 1000  8    when he so desired, yet bold and resolute in his decisions,
C06 1010  5    and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess: The
C06 1020  3    ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion
C06 1030  1    and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word".
C06 1030 10       Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating
C06 1040  7    book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which
C06 1050  5    is jagged at the edges- there is no mention of the
C06 1060  5    Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan. And in a
C06 1070  3    concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary
C06 1080  1    world, one senses certain misplacements of emphasis
C06 1080  8    and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle
C06 1090  7    of our time: How to deal with a wily and aggressive
C06 1100  5    enemy without appeasement and without war.
C06 1110  1       But one should not ask for everything. Mr. Kennan,
C06 1110 10    who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round
C06 1120  7    of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador
C06 1130  4    to Yugoslavia, is not the only man who finds it easier
C06 1140  4    to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.
C06 1150  1    The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western
C06 1150 12    relations is vitally important, and it is told with
C06 1160  9    the fire of a first-rate historical narrator. The Ireland
C06 1180  3    we usually hear about in the theater is a place of
C06 1180 14    bitter political or domestic unrest, lightened occasionally
C06 1200  6    with flashes of native wit and charm. In "Donnybrook",
C06 1210  5    there is quite a different Eire, a rural land where
C06 1220  4    singing, dancing, fist-fighting and romancing are the
C06 1230  1    thing. There is plenty of violence, to be sure, but
C06 1230 11    it is a nice violence and no one gets killed. By and
C06 1240  8    large, Robert McEnroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's
C06 1250  4    film, "The Quiet Man", provides the entertainment it
C06 1260  4    set out to, and we have a lively musical show if not
C06 1270  2    a superlative one.
C06 1270  5    _@_
C06 1270  6       This is the tale of one John Enright, an American
C06 1280  3    who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring
C06 1290  1    and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place
C06 1290 13    where he may become a quiet man. But Innesfree, where
C06 1300  7    Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother, Will, live,
C06 1310  5    is no place for a man who will not use his fists. So
C06 1320  4    Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded
C06 1330  1    considerably, thereby providing the tale which is told.
C06 1330  9    You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a
C06 1340 11    fine old knockdown fight with the brother, and that
C06 1350  5    there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure
C06 1360  3    that you understand what the word Donnybrook means.
C06 1370  1       Then there is a matchmaker, one Mikeen Flynn, a
C06 1370  9    role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected. Now
C06 1380  6    there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in
C06 1390  4    Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe
C06 1400  1    dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs,
C06 1400 10    torso and neck, except that these talents add immensely
C06 1410  7    to the enjoyment of the play. Mr. Foy is a joy, having
C06 1420  7    learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically
C06 1430  5    perfect. His matchmaking is, naturally, incidental,
C06 1440  1    and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow
C06 1440 11    takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.
C06 1450 11       Art Lund, a fine big actor with a great head of
C06 1460  8    blond hair and a good voice, impersonates Enright.
C06 1470  2    Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic
C06 1480  1    technique, that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed
C06 1480 11    to have, anyway. Joan Fagan, a fiery redhead who can
C06 1490  9    impress you that she has a temper whether she really
C06 1500  7    has one or not, plays Ellen, and sings the role very
C06 1510  4    well, too. If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a
C06 1520  2    bit of theatrical dross in it, never mind; she fits
C06 1520 12    into the general scheme well enough.
C06 1530  4       Susan Johnson, as the widow, spends the first half
C06 1540  3    of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented
C06 1550  1    death of her late husband and the second half trying
C06 1550 11    to acquire a new one. She has a good, firm delivery
C06 1560  8    of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening.
C06 1570  4       Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace
C06 1580  3    Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf
C06 1590  1    of stock Irish characters, but they put such a combination
C06 1590 11    of good will and malevolence into their parts that
C06 1600  8    they're quite entertaining. And in the role of Will
C06 1610  7    Danaher, Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently
C06 1620  2    to intimidate not only one American but the whole British
C06 1630  1    army, if he chose.
C06 1630  5       "Donnybrook" is no "Brigadoon", but it does have
C06 1640  5    some very nice romantic background touches and some
C06 1650  1    excellent dancing. The ballads are sweet and sad, and
C06 1650 10    the music generally competent. It sometimes threatens
C06 1660  5    to linger in the memory after the final curtain, and
C06 1670  5    some of it, such as the catchy "Sez I", does. "A Toast
C06 1680  4    To The Bride", sung by Clarence Nordstrom, playing
C06 1690  1    a character called Old Man Toomey, is quite simple,
C06 1690 10    direct and touching.
C06 1700  2       The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in
C06 1710  1    cloth caps and sweaters, and their dancing and singing
C06 1710 10    is fine. So is that of the limber company of lasses
C06 1720  8    who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's
C06 1730  4    expert choreographic direction. The male dancers sometimes
C06 1740  2    wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited
C06 1740 11    and stimulating.
C06 1750  2       Rouben Ter-Arutunian, in his stage settings, often
C06 1760  2    uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed
C06 1760 12    couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the
C06 1770 11    scenes which are to follow. There is no reason why
C06 1780  6    most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time
C06 1790  3    at "Donnybrook", unless they are permanently in the
C06 1800  1    mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could
C06 1800 12    hate the lovable Irish.
C06 1820  1       WE can all breathe more easily this morning- more
C06 1820 10    easily and joyously, too- because Joshua Logan has
C06 1830  8    turned the stage show, "Fanny", into a delightful and
C06 1840  6    heart-warming film.
C06 1840  9       The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's
C06 1850 10    original trio of French films about people of the waterfront
C06 1860  9    in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen,
C06 1870  6    after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom,
C06 1880  3    was a delicate and perilous one, indeed. More than
C06 1890  1    the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic
C06 1890 11    star, the great Raimu, were looking askance at the
C06 1900  7    project. The fans of the musical were, too.
C06 1910  3       But now the task is completed and the uncertainty
C06 1920  1    resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture
C06 1920 10    at the Music Hall yesterday. Whether fan of the Pagnol
C06 1930  8    films or stage show, whether partial to music or no,
C06 1940  6    you can't help but derive joy from this picture if
C06 1950  3    you have a sense of humor and a heart.
