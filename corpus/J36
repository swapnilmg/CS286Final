J36 0010  1       Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of
J36 0010  8    opinion should arise about the methods for applying
J36 0020  7    these policies. It was nevertheless almost incredible
J36 0030  3    that four years after Yalta there should be a complete
J36 0040  2    split over Germany, with hot heads on both sides planning
J36 0040 12    to use the Germans against their former allies, and
J36 0050  9    with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their
J36 0060  5    power by fighting on one side or the other.
J36 0070  2    #5. POLAND#
J36 0070  4    _FRONTIERS._
J36 0070  5       When the Yalta Conference opened, the American policy
J36 0080  5    of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries
J36 0090  3    until the peace conference had broken down. Starting
J36 0100  1    in great force late in December, from a line stretching
J36 0100 11    from East Prussia to Budapest, the Red armies had swept
J36 0110 10    two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder, thirty
J36 0120  7    miles from Berlin, and the Upper Danube region was
J36 0130  4    being rapidly overrun, while the Western Allies had
J36 0140  2    not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine.
J36 0140 13    The long delay in opening the Second Front was now
J36 0150  9    working to Russia's advantage.
J36 0160  1       The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon
J36 0160 11    Line, which was substantially Russia's 1941 border,
J36 0170  7    as the boundary between Russia and Poland. When this
J36 0180  6    proposal was made, Stalin spoke with stronger emotion
J36 0190  4    than at any other time during the Conference. He stood
J36 0200  3    up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.
J36 0200 12    The bitter memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris
J36 0210  8    Peace Conference and of the West's effort to stamp
J36 0220  8    out Bolshevism at its birth boiled up within him. "You
J36 0230  5    would drive us into shame", he declared. The White
J36 0240  3    Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and
J36 0240 12    Molotov were far less reliable defenders of Russia
J36 0250  8    than Curzon and Clemenceau.
J36 0260  1       Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted
J36 0270  1    the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there
J36 0270 10    should be digressions from that line of five to eight
J36 0280  9    kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions. He did
J36 0290  6    not mind the Line itself, which Churchill declared
J36 0300  2    in the House of Commons, on February 27, 1945, he had
J36 0310  1    always believed to be "just and right", but he did
J36 0310 11    not want it called by a hated name. The West had long
J36 0320  9    since forgotten the events of 1919, but it was not
J36 0330  7    so easy for the Red leaders, who felt that they had
J36 0340  2    suffered great injustice in that period.
J36 0340  8       In the Dunn-Atherton memorandum of February 4, 1942,
J36 0350  6    the State Department had expected to be able to hold
J36 0360  6    Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941
J36 0370  3    boundaries. Now Stalin made it clear that he meant
J36 0370 12    to move Poland's western borders deep into Germany,
J36 0380  7    back to the western Neisse-Oder River lines, taking
J36 0390  6    not only East Prussia and all of Silesia but Pomerania
J36 0400  4    and the tip of Brandenburg, back to and including Stettin.
J36 0410  2    From six to nine million additional Germans would be
J36 0420  1    evicted, though most would have fled, and Poland would
J36 0420 10    receive far more from Germany than the poor territories,
J36 0430  7    including the great Pripet Marshes, which she lost
J36 0440  5    to Russia. Stalin declared that he preferred to continue
J36 0450  3    the war a little longer, "although it costs us blood",
J36 0460  1    in order to give Poland compensation in the West at
J36 0460 11    the expense of the Germans.
J36 0470  4       By this time Churchill was not so cordial toward
J36 0480  1    moving Poland westward as he had been at Teheran, where
J36 0480 11    he and Eden had both heartily approved the idea. After
J36 0490  9    "a prolonged study of the Oder line on a map", at Teheran,
J36 0500 10    Churchill "liked the picture". He would tell the Poles,
J36 0510  7    he said, that they had been "given a fine place to
J36 0520  5    live in, more than three hundred miles each way". At
J36 0530  2    Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans
J36 0530 11    who would have to leave, trying to find work in Germany,
J36 0540 10    and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River
J36 0550  6    being chosen in the south, instead of the Eastern Neisse,
J36 0560  5    both of which flow into the Oder.
J36 0560 12       The issue was left in abeyance, presumably for the
J36 0570  9    peace conference. However, there was no real question
J36 0580  6    of the justice of creating a strong Poland, both industrially
J36 0590  4    and agriculturally, and one unplagued by large minorities
J36 0600  2    of Germans or Russians. The moving of millions of the
J36 0610  1    German master-race, from the very heart of Junkerdom,
J36 0610 10    to make room for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved
J36 0620  9    and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation,
J36 0630  5    but there was little doubt that it was historically
J36 0640  3    justified.
J36 0640  4    _GOVERNMENT._
J36 0640  5       Of more importance to the West than Poland's boundaries
J36 0650  6    was the character of her government. At Yalta the West
J36 0660  5    still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in
J36 0670  4    its orbit, in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies.
J36 0670 13    Though little democracy had ever been practised in
J36 0680  8    this region, and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic
J36 0690  7    means, it was taken for granted that at least the forms
J36 0700  5    of Western democracy would be established in this area
J36 0710  2    and Western capitalism preserved within it. Believing
J36 0710  9    devoutly as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions, it
J36 0720  9    was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that
J36 0730  5    the Poles should have them.
J36 0730 10       The issue was acute because the exiled Polish Government
J36 0740  9    in London, supported in the main by Britain, was still
J36 0750  8    competing with the new Lublin Government formed behind
J36 0760  4    the Red Army. More time was spent in trying to marry
J36 0770  4    these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed
J36 0770 11    at Yalta. The result was an agreement that the Lublin
J36 0780 10    Government should be "reorganized on a broader democratic
J36 0790  7    basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from
J36 0800  5    Poland itself and from the Poles abroad", and pledged
J36 0810  3    to hold "free and unfettered elections as soon as possible
J36 0820  1    on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot".
J36 0820 10    All "democratic and anti-Nazi parties" were to have
J36 0830  9    the right to campaign.
J36 0840  1       Roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate
J36 0840  9    on this issue. It was a matter of principle with Churchill,
J36 0850 10    since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland.
J36 0860  7    To Stalin it was a matter of life and death. He made
J36 0870  6    this completely clear. Speaking with "great earnestness",
J36 0880  2    he said: "For the Russian people, the question of Poland
J36 0890  3    is not only a question of honor but also a question
J36 0890 14    of security. Throughout history, Poland has been the
J36 0900  7    corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia.
J36 0910  7    Twice in the last thirty years our enemies, the Germans,
J36 0920  4    have passed through this corridor. It is in Russia's
J36 0930  2    interest that Poland should be strong and powerful,
J36 0930 10    in a position to shut the door of this corridor by
J36 0940 10    her own force ... It is necessary that Poland should
J36 0950  6    be free, independent in power. Therefore, it is not
J36 0960  4    only a question of honor but of life and death for
J36 0960 15    the Soviet state".
J36 0970  3       In other words, the Soviet Union was determined
J36 0980  1    to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark
J36 0980 13    against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that
J36 0990  9    there would never be any question of her serving as
J36 1000  6    a cordon sanitaire against the Soviets or posing as
J36 1010  4    an independent, balancing power in between Russia and
J36 1020  1    Germany. Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the
J36 1020  8    Soviets used the same security argument to justify
J36 1030  7    their course in Poland. This reasoning was also as
J36 1040  4    inevitable as anything could be. Any free elections
J36 1050  1    that were to be held in Poland would have to produce
J36 1050 12    a government in which Moscow had complete confidence,
J36 1060  7    and all pressure from the West for free voting by anti-Soviet
J36 1070  7    elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on
J36 1080  3    voting by these elements.
J36 1080  7    #6. LIBERATED EUROPE#
J36 1090  1    In even greater degree the same rule applied to the
J36 1090 11    remainder of Eastern Europe, where the upper classes
J36 1100  6    had generally collaborated with the Nazis, even to
J36 1110  5    the extent of sending millions of their peasants into
J36 1120  1    Russia as a part of Hitler's armies. But at Yalta the
J36 1120 12    conflicting expectations of East and West were merged
J36 1130  8    into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated
J36 1140  8    countries in Europe "to create democratic institutions
J36 1160  3    of their own choice". In any case "where in their judgment
J36 1170  4    conditions require" [italics added] they would "form
J36 1180  3    interim governmental authorities broadly representative
J36 1190  1    of all democratic elements in the population and pledged
J36 1190 10    to the earliest possible establishment through free
J36 1200  5    elections of governments responsive to the will of
J36 1210  5    the people". Other similar affirmations in the Declaration
J36 1220  2    on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions
J36 1230  1    on the Western model. Later it developed that the Soviets
J36 1230 11    had a very different interpretation of democracy, which
J36 1240  8    will be discussed later, and their judgment never told
J36 1250  7    them that the Big Three should unite in establishing
J36 1260  4    democratic conditions, as we understand them, within
J36 1270  2    their zone of influence.
J36 1270  6       Professor McNeill thinks that at Yalta, Stalin did
J36 1280  5    not fully realize the dilemma which faced him, that
J36 1290  2    he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters
J36 1290 11    from East European elections would not be greatly resented
J36 1300  7    by his allies, while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill
J36 1310  5    frankly faced "the fact that, in Poland at least, genuinely
J36 1320  4    free democratic elections would return governments
J36 1330  1    unfriendly to Russia", by any definition of international
J36 1330  9    friendliness. Also war-time propaganda and cooperation
J36 1340  7    had "obscured the differences between Russian and Western
J36 1350  7    ideas of democracy", and it seemed better to have them
J36 1360  8    covered by verbal formulae than to imperil the military
J36 1370  3    victories over Germany and Japan.
J36 1370  8       The application of these formulae could not please
J36 1380  7    both sides, for they really attempted to marry the
J36 1390  5    impossible to the inevitable. While obliged to concede
J36 1400  3    governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union
J36 1410  1    instead of opposed to it, we thought we had preserved
J36 1410 11    our social and economic system in East Europe.
J36 1420  6       This illusion was described in a far-sighted editorial
J36 1430  6    in the New York Herald Tribune, on March 5, 1947, in
J36 1440  5    connection with the submission of the satellite peace
J36 1450  1    treaties to the Senate. In doing so Marshall and Byrnes
J36 1450 11    were "asking for the ratification of a grim lesson
J36 1460  8    in the facts of international life". We had entertained
J36 1470  5    exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing
J36 1480  3    our system throughout the world. "We were troubled
J36 1490  3    about the fate of the Baltic States. Yalta left us
J36 1490 13    with comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic
J36 1500  8    political economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon
J36 1510  8    line and the borders of Bessarabia". [Italics added.]
J36 1520  3       This is a penetrating description of our post-war
J36 1530  5    illusion, which applied to other areas than East Europe.
J36 1540  2    The same editorial continued that "We expected to democratize
J36 1550  1    Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself
J36 1550 12    easily on our institutions. We expected, in short,
J36 1560  8    that most of the world would make itself over in our
J36 1570  7    image and that it would be relatively simple, from
J36 1580  2    such a position, to deal with the localized aberrations
J36 1580 11    of the Soviet Union". Yet actually "the image corresponded
J36 1590  9    in no way to the actualities of the post-war world.
J36 1600 10    Neither our military, our economic nor our ideological
J36 1610  5    power reached far enough" to determine the fate of
J36 1620  4    East Europe. Then the editorial added prophetically:
J36 1630  1    "how far they may reach in Asia is yet undetermined,
J36 1630 11    but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences".
J36 1640 10       Here is the best short explanation of the origins
J36 1650  8    of the Cold War that has been written. Failing to heed
J36 1660  5    the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite treaties,
J36 1670  2    President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March
J36 1680  1    12, 1947, in the Truman Doctrine, exactly one week
J36 1680 10    after the Herald Tribune editorial was written, and
J36 1690  6    a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill
J36 1700  6    at Fulton, Missouri, in Truman's presence. Then China
J36 1710  4    promptly went Communist, and Mr. Truman had to fight
J36 1720  4    the interminable Korean war for the democratization
J36 1720 11    of Korea before we learned how far our writ did "reach
J36 1730 11    in Asia".
J36 1740  1       Years of war, strain, and hatred; of heavy arms
J36 1740 10    expenditures and constant danger of another world war
J36 1750  8    had to ensue before the United States could bring itself
J36 1760  5    to accept the two chief results of World War II- Communist
J36 1770  4    control of East Europe and China.
J36 1780  1    _A NEW BALANCE OF POWER._
J36 1780  5       While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it
J36 1790  2    all on Yalta. Yet, in summarizing a series of careful
J36 1790 12    essays on the Yalta Conference, Forrest Pogue could
J36 1800  8    find no basis for Yalta becoming "a symbol for betrayal
J36 1810  6    and a shibboleth for the opponents of Roosevelt and
J36 1820  4    international cooperation". When the Yalta Papers were
J36 1830  2    finally published with great fanfare they had revealed
J36 1830 10    no betrayal by anyone.
