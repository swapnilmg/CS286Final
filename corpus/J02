J02 0010  1    #ABSTRACT#
J02 0010  2    Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a
J02 0010 11    porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas (Argon).
J02 0020  9    Thus, the energy transferred from the arc to the anode
J02 0030  9    was partly fed back into the arc. It was shown that
J02 0040  7    by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc
J02 0050  4    to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15%
J02 0050 13    of the total arc energy A detailed energy balance of
J02 0060  9    the anode was established. The anode ablation could
J02 0080  5    be reduced to a negligible amount. The dependence of
J02 0090  2    the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the
J02 0090 12    transpirating gas was investigated for various arc
J02 0100  7    lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Amp.
J02 0110  6    Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion
J02 0120  4    pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the
J02 0130  1    arc at various mass flow velocities.
J02 0130  7    #INTRODUCTION#
J02 0130  8    The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces
J02 0140  7    of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent
J02 0150  5    electrode ablation. The cooling requirements are particularly
J02 0160  3    severe at the anode. In free burning electric arcs,
J02 0170  2    for instance, approximately 90% of the total arc power
J02 0170 11    is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat
J02 0180  9    fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors-
J02 0190  7    the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere. In
J02 0200  3    plasma generators as currently commercially available
J02 0210  1    for industrial use or as high temperature research
J02 0210  9    tools often more than 50% of the total energy input
J02 0220  7    is being transferred to the co0ling medium of the anode.
J02 0230  5       The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared
J02 0240  2    with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical
J02 0250  1    phenomena occurring in free burning arcs. In plasma
J02 0250  9    generators the superimposed forced convection may modify
J02 0260  6    the picture somewhat. The heat transfer to the anode
J02 0270  5    is due to the following effects: 1. Heat of condensation
J02 0280  3    (work function) plus kinetic energy of the electrons
J02 0280 11    impinging on the anode. This energy transfer depends
J02 0290  8    on the current, the temperature in the arc column,
J02 0300  6    the anode material, and the conditions in the anode
J02 0310  4    sheath. 2. Heat transfer by molecular conduction as
J02 0310 12    well as by radiation from the arc column.
J02 0320  8       The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs
J02 0330  7    is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode
J02 0350  3    towards the anode with velocities up **f. This phenomenon
J02 0360  1    has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker
J02 0360  9    (Ref. 1). The pressure gradient producing the jet is
J02 0370  9    due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc
J02 0380  6    (rapid decrease of current density from cathode to
J02 0390  2    the anode). Hence, the flow conditions at the anode
J02 0390 11    of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation
J02 0400  8    point.
J02 0400  9       it is apparent from the above and from experimental
J02 0410  7    evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode
J02 0420  4    of free burning arcs are large compared with those
J02 0440  2    for the cathode. The gas flow through a plasma generator
J02 0440 12    will modify these conditions; however, the anode is
J02 0450  7    still the part receiving the largest heat flux. An
J02 0460  6    attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency
J02 0470  4    of the plasma generators must, therefore, aim at a
J02 0480  2    reduction of the anode loss. The following possibilities
J02 0480 10    exist for achieving this: 1. The use of high voltages
J02 0490  9    and low currents by proper design to reduce electron
J02 0500  5    heat transfer to the anode for a given power output.
J02 0510  3    2. Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the
J02 0510 13    anode by flow or magnetic forces. 3. Feed back of the
J02 0530 11    energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration
J02 0540  8    through the anode.
J02 0550  1       The third method was, to our knowledge, successfully
J02 0550  9    applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers
J02 0560  9    (Ref. 2). The purpose of the present study is to study
J02 0570  7    the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance
J02 0580  4    for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect
J02 0590  1    of blowing on the arc voltage. Gas injection through
J02 0590 10    a porous anode (transpiration cooling) not only feeds
J02 0600  6    back the energy transferred to the anode by the above
J02 0610  7    mentioned processes, but also modifies the conditions
J02 0620  1    in the arc itself. A detailed study of this latter
J02 0620 11    phenomenon was not attempted in this paper. Argon was
J02 0630  9    used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation
J02 0640  6    or chemical reaction. The anode material was porous
J02 0650  4    graphite. Sintered porous metals should be usable in
J02 0660  2    principle. However, technical difficulties arise by
J02 0660  8    melting at local hot spots. The experimental arrangement
J02 0670  6    as described below is based on the geometry of free
J02 0680  6    burning arcs. Thus, direct comparisons can be drawn
J02 0690  3    with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail
J02 0690 13    during the past years and decades by numerous investigators
J02 0700  9    (Ref. 3).
J02 0710  1    #EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS#
J02 0710  3    Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views
J02 0720  2    of the test stand and of two different models of the
J02 0720 13    anode holder. The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' diameter
J02 0730  9    thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper
J02 0740  8    tube. This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction
J02 0750  6    by an electric drive to establish the required electrode
J02 0760  3    spacing. The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means
J02 0770  1    of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug
J02 0770 12    and disk. The transpiring gas ejected from the anode
J02 0780  7    formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below.
J02 0790  5    Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented
J02 0800  3    by the two disks shown in figure 2. Argon was also
J02 0810  1    blown at low velocities (mass flow rate **f) through
J02 0810 10    a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution
J02 0830  7    against contamination of the arc by air. The anode
J02 0840  6    consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug,
J02 0850  2    1/4 inch long. The graphite was National Carbon NC
J02 0860  1    60, which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore
J02 0860 12    size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure
J02 0870  8    uniformity of the flow leaving the anode. The anode
J02 0880  5    plug (Figure 2) was inserted into a carbon anode holder.
J02 0890  3    A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream
J02 0900  1    temperature of the transpiring gas. It was exposed
J02 0900  9    to a high velocity gas jet. A plug and a tube with
J02 0910  9    holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber
J02 0920  3    above the porous plug into two parts. This arrangement
J02 0930  1    had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the
J02 0930 11    thermocouple by natural convection. Two pyrometers
J02 0940  5    shown in figure 1 and 2 (Pyrometer Instrument Co. Model
J02 0950  4    95) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode
J02 0960  3    surface temperature and the temperature distribution
J02 0960  9    along the anode holder. Three thermocouples were placed
J02 0970  8    at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding
J02 0980  6    the anode holder to determine its temperature.
J02 0990  2       Another anode holder used in the experiments is
J02 0990 10    shown in figure 3. In this design the anode holder
J02 1000 10    is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from
J02 1010  7    the anode were determined by measuring the temperature
J02 1020  3    rise of the coolant. To reduce heat transfer from the
J02 1030  2    hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of
J02 1030 12    the arc, a carbon shield was attached tothe surface
J02 1040  6    providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate
J02 1050  5    and the surface of the anode holder. In addition, the
J02 1060  2    inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with
J02 1060 11    aluminum foil to reduce radiation. Temperatures of
J02 1070  6    the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode
J02 1080  6    holder were measured by thermocouples to account for
J02 1090  2    heat received by the coolant but not originating from
J02 1090 11    the anode plug.
J02 1100  2       The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated
J02 1110  1    by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow
J02 1110 11    rator. The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier.
J02 1120  8    At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5
J02 1130  8    V (peak to peak) with a resistive load. The current
J02 1140  4    was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured
J02 1150  2    with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter. The arc voltage
J02 1160  1    was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were
J02 1160  9    connected to the anode and cathode holders. Because
J02 1170  5    of the falling characteristic of the rectifier, no
J02 1180  3    ballast resistor was required for stability of operation.
J02 1190  1    A high frequency starter was used to start the arc.
J02 1190 11    #EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND ERROR ANALYSIS#
J02 1210  1    _1. TRANSPIRATION COOLED ANODE WITH CARBON ANODE HOLDER_
J02 1210  4       The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed
J02 1230  1    with two goals in mind. The heat losses of the holder
J02 1230 12    were to be reduced as far as possible and they should
J02 1240  8    be such that an accurate heat balance can be made.
J02 1250  5    In order to reduce the number of variable parameters,
J02 1260  1    all experiments were made with a constant arc length
J02 1260 10    of 0.5'' and a current of 100 Amp. The argon flow
J02 1270 10    through the porous anode was varied systematically
J02 1280  4    between **f. and **f. The lower limit was determined
J02 1290  3    by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started
J02 1300  1    to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous
J02 1300 12    graphite plug and that it became highly unstable. The
J02 1310  8    upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring
J02 1320  5    the characteristic anode surface temperature (see below)
J02 1330  3    since only a small region of the anode was struck by
J02 1330 14    the arc. This region which had a higher temperature
J02 1340  9    than the rest of the anode surface changed size and
J02 1350  6    location continuously.
J02 1350  8       For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured.
J02 1360  9    To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug,
J02 1370  6    the surface was scanned with a pyrometer. As it turned
J02 1380  4    out, a very hot region occurred on the plug. Its temperature
J02 1390  1    was denoted by **f. The size of this hot region was
J02 1390 12    estimated by eye. The rest of the surface had a temperature
J02 1400 11    which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug.
J02 1410  7    The mean temperature of this region was approximated
J02 1420  3    by the temperature measured halfways between the edge
J02 1430  2    of the hot spot and the rim of the plug. It was denoted
J02 1430 15    by **f. The mean temperature of the surface was then
J02 1440  9    computed according to the following relation: **f where
J02 1450  6    x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the
J02 1470  4    hot spot. Assuming thermal equilibrium between the
J02 1480  1    anode surface and the transpiring argon, the gas enthalpy
J02 1480 10    rise through the anode was calculated according to
J02 1490  7    the relation **f whereby the specific heat of argon
J02 1500  4    was taken as **f. This calculation results in an enthalpy
J02 1510  2    rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass
J02 1510 12    flow equally distributed over the plug cross section
J02 1520  7    whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to
J02 1530  5    be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.
J02 1540  1       The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple
J02 1550  1    shown in figure 2 was **f. The **f values are listed
J02 1550 12    in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures
J02 1570  6    and arc voltages. Simultaneously with the anode surface
J02 1580  5    temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings
J02 1590  2    were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon
J02 1590 11    anode holder as indicated on figure 2. Some of these
J02 1600 10    temperatures are plotted in figure 4. They showed no
J02 1610  7    marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy
J02 1620  4    of these measurements. Thus, the dotted line shown
J02 1630  1    in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature
J02 1630 11    distribution for all blowing rates.
J02 1640  4       The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in
J02 1650  2    figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the
J02 1650 10    surface of **f. This temperature was taken as environmental
J02 1660  8    temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as
J02 1670  7    far as radiation is concerned. It is sufficiently small
J02 1680  4    compared with the surface temperature of the anode
J02 1690  1    holder, to make the energy flux radiated from the environment
J02 1690 11    toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy
J02 1700  8    of the present measurements. The reflection of radiation
J02 1710  5    originating from the anode holder and reflected back
J02 1720  4    to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also
J02 1730  1    be small because of the specular characteristic of
J02 1730  9    the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry. The
J02 1740  7    total heat loss through the anode holder included also
J02 1750  4    the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical
J02 1760  1    piece into the adjacent metal parts. It was calculated
J02 1760 10    from the temperature gradient **f at **f inch as **f.
J02 1770  9    The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug
J02 1780  7    holder is thereby **f The temperature distribution
J02 1790  2    of figure 4 gives **f for all blowing rates, assuming
J02 1790 12    **f. The temperature dependent value of |e was taken
J02 1800  9    from Ref. 7. The radiation loss from the anode surface
J02 1810  9    was computed according to **f where **f is the mean
J02 1820  7    of the fourth powers of the temperatures **f and **f
J02 1830  3    calculated analogously to equation (1).
