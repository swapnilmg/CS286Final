F17 0010  1       Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian
F17 0020  1    Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his
F17 0020 11    native Highlands, conceived a plan to settle them in
F17 0030  8    the valley of the Red River of the North. Since the
F17 0040  6    land he desired lay within the great northern empire
F17 0050  2    of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks
F17 0050 11    of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling
F17 0060  9    its policies. Having achieved this end, he was able
F17 0070  7    to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red
F17 0080  5    and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched
F17 0090  1    southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red-
F17 0090 10    was made in May, 1811, and by October of that year
F17 0100 11    a small group of Scots was settling for the winter
F17 0110  6    at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus at the same time
F17 0120  5    that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify
F17 0130  1    the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame
F17 0130  9    at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement
F17 0140  6    made a great leap into the center of the North American
F17 0150  6    continent to the west of the American agricultural
F17 0160  2    frontier.
F17 0160  3       Seven hundred miles south of York Factory, at "the
F17 0170  3    Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three
F17 0180  1    men located a settlement in August 1812. By October
F17 0180 10    the little colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg)
F17 0190  8    numbered 100. Within a few years the Scots, engaged
F17 0200  7    in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil
F17 0210  4    of the valley, were joined by a group called Meurons.
F17 0220  1    The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries
F17 0220 10    transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the
F17 0230  9    Americans in the War of 1812, had settled in Montreal
F17 0240  8    and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815. Selkirk
F17 0250  6    persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red
F17 0260  3    River where they were to serve as a military force
F17 0260 13    to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest
F17 0270  7    Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into
F17 0280  5    the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries were little
F17 0290  3    interested in farming and added nothing to the output
F17 0290 12    of the farm plots on which all work was still done
F17 0300 11    with hoes as late as 1818.
F17 0310  2       It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the
F17 0310 13    ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal
F17 0320 10    of the settlement southward. When late in the summer
F17 0330  7    the full extent of the damage was assessed, all but
F17 0340  4    fifty of the Scots, Swiss and metis moved up the Red
F17 0350  3    to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built
F17 0350 13    huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's
F17 0360  8    barony in Scotland. The new site was somewhat warmer
F17 0370  7    than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds
F17 0380  5    of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for
F17 0390  1    food.
F17 0390  2       The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their
F17 0390 10    move southward by British fur traders. For many years
F17 0400  9    the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters
F17 0410  5    at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi River, some
F17 0420  3    300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul, Minnesota.
F17 0430  2    When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign
F17 0430 12    firm out of the United States, its British-born employees,
F17 0440 10    now become American citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph
F17 0450  4    Renville and Alexis Bailly- continued in the fur business.
F17 0460  8    On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River,
F17 0470  6    Robert Dickson, Superintendent of the Western Indian
F17 0480  4    Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned
F17 0490  1    in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men
F17 0490 13    and two small artillery pieces. His trading goods came
F17 0500  7    from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's
F17 0510  7    settlement he brought them south in carts. These carts
F17 0520  5    were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander
F17 0530  3    Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk
F17 0540  1    colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new
F17 0540 11    carts" as being about four feet off the ground and
F17 0550  9    carrying five times as much as a horse could pack.
F17 0560  5    They were held together by pegs and withes and in later
F17 0570  3    times drawn by a single ox in thills.
F17 0570 11       It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that
F17 0580  7    he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United
F17 0590  6    States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina) Dickson
F17 0600  2    met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of
F17 0600 14    Sioux, he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the
F17 0610  9    trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois
F17 0620  6    territory to Indiana and the eastern United States
F17 0630  3    was the best route for goods from England to reach
F17 0640  1    Red River and that the United States was a better source
F17 0640 12    of supply for many goods than either Canada or England.
F17 0650  9    Upon arriving at Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22
F17 0660  6    wrote to John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State at Washington,
F17 0670  6    inquiring about laws covering trade with "Missouri
F17 0680  3    and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he declared
F17 0690  2    prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at
F17 0690 11    first, would increase with the progress of our Settlements
F17 0700  9    ...".
F17 0710  1       The route which he had traveled and which he believed
F17 0710 10    might develop into a trade route was followed by his
F17 0720  9    settlers earlier than he might have expected. In 1819
F17 0730  5    grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the Forks"
F17 0740  2    (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left
F17 0740 11    Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at
F17 0750  9    Prairie du Chien. It was a three-month journey in the
F17 0760  9    dead of winter followed by three months of labor on
F17 0770  5    Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice gone from
F17 0780  3    the St. Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)
F17 0790  1    their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and
F17 0790 11    barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were
F17 0800  7    loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the
F17 0810  5    river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,
F17 0820  1    and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June
F17 0820 11    1820. This epic effort to secure seed for the colony
F17 0830  9    cost Selkirk @1,040. Nevertheless so short was the
F17 0840  6    supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat
F17 0850  4    to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became
F17 0860  1    more plentiful and the colony remained in the north
F17 0860 10    the year round.
F17 0870  1       Activity by British traders and the presence of
F17 0870  9    a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department
F17 0880 10    in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth
F17 0890  5    from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie
F17 0900  6    du Chien, until then the most advanced United States
F17 0910  3    post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived
F17 0920  2    at the mouth of the St. Peter's River, the head of
F17 0920 13    navigation on the Mississippi, and began construction
F17 0930  7    of Fort St. Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed
F17 0940  7    in honor of its commander, Colonel Josiah Snelling.
F17 0950  4       It was from the American outposts that Red River
F17 0960  4    shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules
F17 0970  1    L. Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien,
F17 0970 11    contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300
F17 0980  8    head of cattle, and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe
F17 0990  6    were hired as drovers. Bailly, after leaving Fort Snelling
F17 1000  5    in August 1821, was forced to leave some of the cattle
F17 1010  5    at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse
F17 1020  2    "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the
F17 1030  1    Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called,
F17 1030  9    late in the fall. He set out on his 700-mile return
F17 1040 10    journey with five families of discontented and disappointed
F17 1050  5    Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States.
F17 1060  4    Observing their distressing condition, Colonel Snelling
F17 1070  2    allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on
F17 1070 10    the military reservation.
F17 1080  2       As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement
F17 1090  2    to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota,
F17 1090 10    Dousman of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du
F17 1100  7    Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in
F17 1110  9    merchandise. Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering
F17 1120  5    to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco. Alexander
F17 1130  2    McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, a
F17 1140  2    chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such
F17 1140 11    "sundry articles" to a value of @4,500.
F17 1150  7       For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled
F17 1160  5    by the approach of American settlement. As the time
F17 1170  4    drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier
F17 1180  1    by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected
F17 1180 11    that the Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer-
F17 1190  9    was on American territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents
F17 1200  5    ordered the settlers to move north, and by October,
F17 1210  5    John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating the
F17 1220  2    timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",
F17 1230  1    he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate
F17 1230 11    establishment ...". Despite Company threats, duly carried
F17 1240  7    through, to cut off supplies of powder, ball, and thread
F17 1250  8    for fishing nets, about 350 persons stayed in the village.
F17 1260  6    They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis
F17 1270  4    or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well as danger".
F17 1280  3       At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to
F17 1290  2    cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823
F17 1290 12    several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling.
F17 1300  9    The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave. After
F17 1310  6    heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, snow fell on
F17 1320  4    October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through
F17 1330  1    a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet
F17 1330 14    thick. In April came a rapid thaw that produced high
F17 1340  8    waters which did not recede until mid-June. On June
F17 1350  5    24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip
F17 1360  2    across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443
F17 1360 11    survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about
F17 1370  8    Fort Snelling, but most of them were sent on to Galena
F17 1380  9    and St. Louis, with a few going as far as Vevay, Indiana,
F17 1390  6    a notable Swiss center in the United States. In 1837,
F17 1400  4    157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were
F17 1410  1    living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.
F17 1410  8       Below the fort, high bluffs extended uninterruptedly
F17 1420  5    for six miles along the Mississippi River. At the point
F17 1430  5    where they ended, another settlement grew up around
F17 1440  3    a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian
F17 1440 13    Galtier in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau
F17 1450  8    and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees
F17 1460  7    from Fort Garry, were joined by the remaining Scots
F17 1470  6    and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton
F17 1480  3    expelled them from the reservation in May 1840. The
F17 1490  2    resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron
F17 1490 12    of Father Galtier's mission, St. Paul, was to become
F17 1500  8    an important center of the fur trade and was to take
F17 1510  9    on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained
F17 1520  3    at Red River.
F17 1520  6       While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly,
F17 1530  4    from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic opportunities
F17 1540  2    did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though
F17 1550  1    the practice violated the no-trading provision of the
F17 1550 10    Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in
F17 1560  7    merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company, some
F17 1570  5    settlers went into trade. The Company maintained a
F17 1580  3    store at which products of England could be purchased
F17 1590  1    and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding
F17 1590 12    that they refrain from trading in furs. Despite this
F17 1600  8    prohibiton, by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants
F17 1610  6    were trading with the Indians for furs. In June 1845,
F17 1620  4    the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20
F17 1630  3    per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were
F17 1630 13    viewed as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's
F17 1640 10    trade and power". To reduce further the flow of goods
F17 1650  8    from England, the Company's local officials asked that
F17 1660  5    its London authorities refrain from forwarding any
F17 1670  2    more trade goods to these men.
F17 1670  8       With their customary source of supply cut off, the
F17 1680  6    Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods
F17 1690  4    to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried
F17 1700  1    pemmican from "the Forks" to St. Paul and goods from
F17 1700 11    St. Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when
F17 1710 12    one trader, Wells, transported twenty barrels of whisky
F17 1720  6    to the British settlement. This trade was subject to
F17 1730  5    a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, but much
F17 1740  3    was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the
F17 1740 12    duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative
F17 1750 12    of the London committee.
F17 1760  1       The trade in a few commodities noted above was to
F17 1760 11    grow in volume as a result of changes both north and
F17 1770 11    south of the 49th parallel.
