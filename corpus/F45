F45 0010  1    With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them
F45 0010  9    no other course to pursue.
F45 0020  3       The directors sold directly to concessionaires,
F45 0020  9    who had to make their profits above the high prices
F45 0030 10    asked by the company. These concessionaires traded
F45 0040  4    where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians
F45 0050  4    through engages, who might be habitants, voyageurs,
F45 0060  1    or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay
F45 0060 10    a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all
F45 0070 10    pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped
F45 0080  5    to France in company ships. The company disposed of
F45 0090  3    the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not
F45 0090 13    show.
F45 0100  1       In accord with its penurious policy, the company
F45 0100  9    failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the
F45 0110  8    principal Indians. The lavish use of presents had been
F45 0120  6    effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France
F45 0130  4    and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change
F45 0140  1    in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the
F45 0140 10    red men. Traders from the English colonies were far
F45 0150  7    more generous, and Indian loyalty turned to them. Protests
F45 0160  5    from governors and intendants passed unheeded, and
F45 0170  2    the parsimonious policy of the company probably let
F45 0170 10    loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the
F45 0180  7    company.
F45 0180  8       In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana
F45 0190  8    with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect
F45 0200  7    the colony. They ordered the raising of troops and
F45 0210  4    obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They
F45 0220  1    adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into
F45 0220 10    five districts. In each of these there was to be a
F45 0230 10    strong military post, and a trading depot to supply
F45 0240  4    the smaller trading houses. For southeastern Louisiana,
F45 0250  1    Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish
F45 0250 11    supplies for trade to the north and east, in the region
F45 0260 11    threatened by British traders. Mobile was to be the
F45 0270  7    anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the
F45 0280  4    sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse, on the
F45 0290  3    Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with
F45 0290 13    the Alabamas and Choctaws, but money was available
F45 0300  7    for only one other new post, near the present Nashville,
F45 0310  6    Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.
F45 0320  1       West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi
F45 0330  1    district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent
F45 0330  9    upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the
F45 0340  9    region westward to the frontiers of New Spain.
F45 0350  4       On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to
F45 0360  4    be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped
F45 0370  1    that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs
F45 0370 12    from the west, principally down the Arkansas River.
F45 0380  6    On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post
F45 0390  5    "at the fork of two great rivers". Other posts would
F45 0400  3    be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication
F45 0410  1    with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois
F45 0410  9    post was to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent
F45 0420  8    posts were to be built on the Missouri, "where there
F45 0430  6    are mines in abundance".
F45 0440  1       Each of the five principal posts was to have a director,
F45 0440 12    responsible to a director-general at New Orleans. An
F45 0450  9    elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked
F45 0460  5    out, and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific
F45 0470  3    way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision
F45 0480  1    of the directors. Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires,
F45 0490  1    and must serve until the term provided in the engagement
F45 0490 11    was ended. The habitants were to be encouraged to trade
F45 0500  9    and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires.
F45 0510  7       Only two principal storehouses were actually established-
F45 0520  4    one at Mobile, the other at New Orleans. New Orleans
F45 0530  4    supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi,
F45 0540  1    and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash.
F45 0540 12    Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods
F45 0550  9    for the Mobile district.
F45 0560  1       The power that Bienville exercised during his first
F45 0560  9    administration cannot be determined. Regulations for
F45 0570  6    the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure
F45 0580  6    de la Louisiane, and Bienville apparently did not have
F45 0590  5    control of that body. The Conseil even treated the
F45 0600  3    serious matter of British aggression as its business
F45 0600 11    and, on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages
F45 0610  9    merchandise "suitable for the peltry trade". It decided,
F45 0620  7    also, that the purely secular efforts of Bienville
F45 0630  4    were insufficient, and sent missionaries to win the
F45 0640  3    savages from the heathen Carolinians.
F45 0640  8       During the first administration of Bienville, the
F45 0650  5    peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative
F45 0660  4    source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually
F45 0670  1    15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws
F45 0670 10    brought the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins
F45 0680  9    were the raw material for the manufacture of leather,
F45 0690  6    and were the only articles which the tribes of this
F45 0700  4    district had to exchange for European goods.
F45 0710  1       During his first administration, Bienville succeeded
F45 0710  6    in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country
F45 0720  7    and the Choctaw country. The director of the post at
F45 0730  6    Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods, of
F45 0740  3    a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the
F45 0740 13    Indian needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished
F45 0750  8    a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and
F45 0760  7    cheaply. De la Laude, commander of the Alabama post,
F45 0770  5    had the friendship of the natives, and was able to
F45 0780  2    make them look upon the British as poor competitors.
F45 0780 11    Diron d'Artaguette, the most prominent trader in the
F45 0790  7    district, was energetic and resourceful, but his methods
F45 0800  5    often aroused the ire of the French governors. He became,
F45 0810  3    after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama River,
F45 0820  2    but his operations extended from Mobile throughout
F45 0820  9    the district, and he finally obtained a monopoly of
F45 0830  8    the Indian trade.
F45 0840  1       The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble
F45 0840  8    in the Mobile district. Their territory lay to the
F45 0850  6    north, near the sources of the Alabama, the Tombigbee,
F45 0860  3    the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was easily
F45 0870  2    accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees.
F45 0870 10    In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders
F45 0880  6    among them, and did not make peace for four years.
F45 0890  6    Venturesome traders, however, continued to come to
F45 0900  3    them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number
F45 0900 12    of pelts for the French markets. British traders from
F45 0910  8    South Carolina incited the Indians against the French,
F45 0920  6    and there developed French and British Factions in
F45 0930  4    the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion
F45 0940  1    for the most disastrous wars during the French control
F45 0940 10    of Louisiana. To hold them was an essential part of
F45 0950  9    French policy, for they controlled the upper termini
F45 0960  5    of the routes from the north to Mobile. They threatened
F45 0970  3    constantly to give the British a hold on this region,
F45 0980  1    from whence they could move easily down the rivers
F45 0980 10    to the French settlements near the Gulf.
F45 0990  5       Bienville realized that if the French were to hold
F45 1000  4    the southeastern tribes against the enticements of
F45 1000 11    British goods, French traders must be able to offer
F45 1010  9    a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable
F45 1020  7    prices. His urgings brought some results. The Company
F45 1030  5    of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian
F45 1040  3    trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms
F45 1050  1    of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement
F45 1050 10    that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus
F45 1060  9    save all costs of transportation into and out of the
F45 1070  6    Indian country.
F45 1070  8       The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal
F45 1080  4    prices to the Indians, in order to drive back the Carolina
F45 1090  4    traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall
F45 1100  1    in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant,
F45 1100 11    remained as acting governor and could do little to
F45 1110  9    stem the Anglican advance. Although he incited a few
F45 1120  6    friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, and even
F45 1130  3    kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.
F45 1140  1       The company was impressed with some ideas of the
F45 1140 10    danger from Carolina, and when Perier came over as
F45 1150  7    governor in 1727, he was given special instructions
F45 1160  2    regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the
F45 1170  1    Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy,
F45 1170 11    made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive
F45 1180  7    prices. To the directors the problem appeared a matter
F45 1190  6    of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier attempted to understand
F45 1200  4    the problem by sending agents to inquire among the
F45 1210  2    Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference
F45 1210 10    between English and French goods, and the prices charged
F45 1220  9    the Indians. They were to conciliate the unfriendly
F45 1230  6    savages, and, wherever possible, to incite the natives
F45 1240  4    to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were to
F45 1250  2    promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well
F45 1250 12    as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices
F45 1260  8    than the opposition was offering. Perier's intrigues
F45 1270  3    gained some successes. The savages divided into two
F45 1280  3    factions; one was British and the other, French. So
F45 1280 12    hostile did these factions become that, among the Choctaws,
F45 1290  9    civil war broke out.
F45 1300  2       Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective
F45 1310  1    in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district,
F45 1310 10    and he decided to send troops into the troubled country.
F45 1320  8    He asked the government for two hundred soldiers, who
F45 1330  6    were to be specifically assigned to arrest English
F45 1340  2    traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's
F45 1350  1    restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the
F45 1350 10    territory. He asked also for more supplies to trade
F45 1360  7    at a low price for the Indians' pelts.
F45 1370  2       No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation,
F45 1390  1    gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district
F45 1390 11    to D'Artaguette. D'Artaguette went vigorously to work,
F45 1400  6    and gave credit to many hunters. But they brought back
F45 1410  6    few pelts to pay their debts, and soon French trade
F45 1420  3    in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one
F45 1430  1    last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance
F45 1430 13    of 40 per cent above the cost in France. The Indians
F45 1440  8    were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders,
F45 1450  5    who swarmed over the country, almost to the Mississippi.
F45 1460  2       With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended all
F45 1470  2    profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted.
F45 1470  9    They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods,
F45 1480  8    and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi. The
F45 1490  5    war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony
F45 1500  4    and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the
F45 1500 13    company asked the crown to relieve it of the government
F45 1510 10    of the colony. It stated that it had lost 20,000,000
F45 1520  8    livres in its operations, and apparently blamed its
F45 1530  3    poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered
F45 1540  1    to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked
F45 1540 10    an indemnity. The King accepted the surrender and fixed
F45 1550  8    the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres.
F45 1560  5    Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana was free to
F45 1570  4    all Frenchmen.
F45 1570  6       Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without
F45 1580  3    fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties
F45 1590  1    of trade had ruined many voyageurs, and numbers of
F45 1590 10    them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood
F45 1600 12    families. Others left the country, and there was no
F45 1610  8    one familiar with the Indian trade. If this trade should
F45 1620  5    be resumed, the habitants who had come to be farmers
F45 1630  4    or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army,
F45 1630 12    must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de
F45 1640 10    bois. This was a slow and difficult course, and French
F45 1650  7    trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group
F45 1660  5    of traders. These men were without capital or experience.
F45 1670  2       Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either
F45 1680  1    to entrust the trade to an association of merchants
F45 1680 10    or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals
F45 1690  7    who would repay their debts with pelts. Bienville,
F45 1700  4    who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected that
F45 1710  2    the merchants would not accept the responsibility of
F45 1710 10    managing a trade in which they could see no hope of
F45 1720 11    profits. He reported, too, that among the habitants
F45 1730  5    there were none of probity and ability sufficient to
F45 1740  3    justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did
F45 1750  1    find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's
F45 1750 11    soldiers to trade. With no company to interfere, he
F45 1760  9    kept close control over all the traders.
F45 1770  3       In order to compete with English traders, Bienville
F45 1780  1    radically changed the price schedule. The King should
F45 1780  9    expect no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent
F45 1790 11    above the cost in France, which would cover the expense
F45 1800  6    of transportation and handling, was all he charged
F45 1810  3    the traders.
