G62 0010  1    To do so, something was necessary beyond volunteering
G62 0010  9    because there was little glamour or romance in the
G62 0020  7    European war; it meant instead hardship, dirt, and
G62 0030  4    death.
G62 0030  5       Baker gave Leonard Wood credit for the initiation
G62 0040  3    of the draft of soldiers; from the General's idea a
G62 0050  2    chain reaction occurred. Wood took the proposal to
G62 0050 10    Chief of Staff Hugh L. Scott, who passed it on to Baker
G62 0060 10    a month before the actual declaration of war against
G62 0070  5    Germany. The Secretary of War gave his assent after
G62 0080  4    studying the history of the draft in the American Civil
G62 0090  2    War as well as the British volunteer system in World
G62 0090 12    War I. He concluded that selective service would
G62 0100  7    not only prevent the disorganization of essential war
G62 0110  4    industries but would avoid the undesirable moral effects
G62 0120  3    of the British reliance on enlistment only- "where
G62 0130  1    the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy
G62 0130 11    by girls pinning white feathers on reluctant young
G62 0140  6    men, orators preaching hate of the Germans, and newspapers
G62 0150  4    exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist out
G62 0160  2    of motives of revenge and retaliation". Baker took
G62 0160 10    the plan to Wilson who said: "Baker, this is plainly
G62 0170  9    right on any ground. Start to prepare the necessary
G62 0180  6    legislation so that if I am obliged to go to Congress
G62 0190  5    the bills will be ready for immediate consideration".
G62 0200  1    The result was that by secret agreement draft machinery
G62 0200 10    was actually ready long before the country knew that
G62 0210  8    the device was to take the place of the volunteering
G62 0220  6    method which Theodore Roosevelt favored. Before the
G62 0230  3    Draft Act was passed Baker had confidentially briefed
G62 0240  1    governors, sheriffs, and prospective draft board members
G62 0240  8    on the administration of the measure- and the confidence
G62 0250  7    was kept so well that only one newspaper learned what
G62 0260  6    was going on. It was Baker, working through Provost
G62 0270  3    Marshal Enoch Crowder and Major Hugh S. ("Old Ironpants")
G62 0280  2    Johnson, who arranged for a secret printing by the
G62 0290  1    million of selective service blanks- again before the
G62 0290  9    Act was passed- until corridors in the Government Printing
G62 0300  9    Office were full and the basement of the Washington
G62 0310  7    Post Office was stacked to the ceiling. General Crowder
G62 0320  3    proposed that Regular Army officers select the draftees
G62 0330  3    in cities and towns throughout the nation; it was Baker
G62 0340  1    who thought of lessening the shock, which conscription
G62 0340  9    always brings to a country, by substituting "Greetings
G62 0350  7    from your neighbors" for the recruiting sergeant, and
G62 0360  5    registration in familiar voting places rather than
G62 0370  3    at military installations.
G62 0370  6       Even so, the Draft Act encountered rough sledding
G62 0380  4    in its progress through the Congress. Democratic Speaker
G62 0390  2    Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript
G62 0400  1    and a convict. Democrat Stanley H. Dent, Chairman of
G62 0400 10    the House Military Affairs Committee, declined to introduce
G62 0410  8    the bill. Democratic Floor Leader Claude Kitchin would
G62 0420  7    have no part of the measure. In the judgment of Chief
G62 0430  7    of Staff Scott it was ironic that the draft policy
G62 0440  4    of a Democratic President, aimed at Germany, had to
G62 0450  2    be pushed through the House of Representatives by the
G62 0450 11    ranking minority member of the Military Affairs Committee-
G62 0460  7    a Republican Jew born in Germany! He was Julius Kahn
G62 0470  8    for whom the Chief of Staff thought no honor could
G62 0480  5    be too great. After Kahn's death in 1924 Scott wrote:
G62 0490  3    "May he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude of
G62 0500  2    his adopted country".
G62 0500  5       In spite of powerful opposition the Draft Act finally
G62 0510  4    passed Congress on May 17, 1917. In early June ten
G62 0520  2    million young men registered by name and number. The
G62 0520 11    day passed without incident in spite of the warning
G62 0530  8    of Senator James A. Reed of Missouri: "Baker, you will
G62 0540  6    have the streets of our American cities running with
G62 0550  4    blood on registration day". On July 20, the first drawing
G62 0560  3    of numbers occurred in the Senate Office Building before
G62 0570  1    a distinguished group of congressmen and high Army
G62 0570  9    officers. Secretary of War Baker, blindfolded, put
G62 0580  6    his hand into a large glass bowl and drew the initial
G62 0590  6    number of those to be called. It was 258. A man in
G62 0600  4    Mississippi wired: "Thanks for drawing 258- that's
G62 0610  1    me". He was the first of 2,800,000 called to the Army
G62 0610 12    through the selective service system.
G62 0620  4    ##
G62 0620  5    It was one thing to call men to the colors; it was
G62 0630  4    another to house, feed, and train them. The existing
G62 0640  1    Army posts were wholly inadequate. In a matter of months
G62 0640 11    the War Department built thirty-two camps, each one
G62 0650  8    accommodating fifty thousand men- sixteen were under
G62 0660  4    canvas in the South and sixteen with frame structures
G62 0670  2    in the North. It was a gargantuan task; a typical cantonment
G62 0680  2    in the North had twelve hundred buildings, an
G62 0680 10    electric-sewer-water
G62 0700  1    system, and twenty-five miles of roads. At Camp Taylor
G62 0700 11    in Kentucky a barracks was built in an hour and a half
G62 0710 11    from timber that had been standing in Mississippi forests
G62 0720  6    one week before. The total operation was a construction
G62 0730  4    project comparable in magnitude with the Panama Canal,
G62 0740  2    but in 1917 time was in short supply; in three months
G62 0750  1    the Army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended
G62 0750 12    on the "big Ditch" in ten years.
G62 0760  5       In later years Josephus Danielswas to claim that
G62 0770  3    World War I was the first in American history in
G62 0770 13    which there was great concern for both the health and
G62 0780 10    morals of our soldiers. It was the first American war
G62 0790  7    in which the death rate from disease was lower than
G62 0800  4    that from battle, due to the provision of trained medical
G62 0810  2    personnel (of the 200,000 officers, 42,000 were physicians),
G62 0810 10    compulsory vaccination, rigorous camp sanitation, and
G62 0820  6    adequate hospital facilities. To the middle of September
G62 0830  7    1918, there had been fewer than 10,000 deaths from
G62 0840  4    disease in the new army. This enviable record would
G62 0850  2    have been maintained but for a great and unexpected
G62 0850 11    disaster which struck the world with murderous stealth.
G62 0860  6    It was the influenza pandemic of 1918-19. The malady
G62 0870  6    was popularly known as the "Spanish flu" from the alleged
G62 0880  4    locale of its origin. The world-wide total of deaths
G62 0890  1    from "Spanish flu" was around twenty million; in the
G62 0890 10    United States 300,000 succumbed to it. In mid-September
G62 0900  9    1918, the influenza-pneumonia pandemic swept through
G62 0910  4    every American military camp; during the eight-week
G62 0920  4    blitz attack 25,000 soldiers died from the disease
G62 0930  1    and the death rate (formerly 5 per year per 1,000 men)
G62 0930 12    increased almost fifty times to 4 per week per 1,000
G62 0940  9    men. In spite of this catastrophe the final mortality
G62 0950  4    figure from disease in the American Army during World
G62 0960  3    War I was 15 per 1,000 per year, contrasted with
G62 0970  1    110 per 1,000 per year in the Mexican War, and 65 in
G62 0970 13    the American Civil War.
G62 0980  2       Both Secretary of War Baker and Secretary of Navy
G62 0990  1    Daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem
G62 0990 10    of providing reasonably normal and wholesome activities
G62 1000  6    in camp for the millions of men who had been removed
G62 1010  6    from their home environment. Their policy ran counter
G62 1020  3    to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually
G62 1020 13    a libertine, and that in sex affairs "God-given passion"
G62 1030 10    was a proof of manliness. Baker moved first; six days
G62 1040  8    after war was declared he appointed Raymond Fosdick
G62 1050  5    chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities
G62 1060  3    (the CTCA). Fosdick, a brother of minister Harry Emerson
G62 1080  3    Fosdick, was a graduate of Princeton, and a member
G62 1080 12    of Phi Beta Kappa and the American Philosophical Association.
G62 1090  9    His assignment was not a new one because Baker had
G62 1100 10    sent him to the Mexican border in 1916 to investigate
G62 1110  6    lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline, drunkenness,
G62 1120  4    and venereal disease in American military camps. Fosdick
G62 1130  3    had found the installations surrounded by a battery
G62 1130 11    of saloons and houses of prostitution, with filles
G62 1140  8    de joie from all over the country flocking to San Antonio,
G62 1150  8    Laredo, and El Paso to "woman the cribs". He also ascertained
G62 1160  7    that many officers were indifferent to the problem,
G62 1170  5    including Commanding General Frederick Funston who
G62 1180  3    gave Fosdick the nickname of "Reverend". On the basis
G62 1190  1    of the long chronicle of military history Funston and
G62 1190 10    his brethren assumed that the issue was insoluble and
G62 1200  8    that anyone interested in a mission like Fosdick's
G62 1210  4    was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder.
G62 1220  1       During the brief Mexican venture Fosdick's report
G62 1220  8    to the Secretary recommended a definite stand by the
G62 1230  8    War Department against the saloon and the excesses
G62 1240  6    of prostitution. The problem involved military necessity
G62 1250  2    as much as morality, for in pre-penicillin days venereal
G62 1260  1    disease was a crippling disability. Fosdick insisted
G62 1260  8    that a strong word was needed from Washington, and
G62 1270  7    it was immediately forthcoming. Baker put the "cribs"
G62 1280  5    and the saloons out of bounds, ordered the co-operation
G62 1290  3    of military officers with local law authorities, and
G62 1290 11    told communities that the troops would be moved unless
G62 1300  9    wholesome conditions were restored. Both Baker and
G62 1310  6    Fosdick knew that a substitute was necessary, that
G62 1320  3    a verboten approach was not the real answer. They were
G62 1330  2    aware that soldiers went to town, in more ways than
G62 1330 12    one, because of the monotony of camp life, to find
G62 1340  9    the only release available in the absence of movies,
G62 1350  5    reading rooms, and playing fields with adequate athletic
G62 1360  2    equipment. Both knew that when trains stopped at Texan
G62 1360 11    crossroads bored soldiers would sometimes enter to
G62 1370  7    ask the passengers if they had any reading material
G62 1380  6    to spare, even a newspaper. There was no time in the
G62 1390  5    short Mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the
G62 1400  1    area provided a proving ground for new departures in
G62 1400 10    the near future.
G62 1410  1       When the United States entered the First World War
G62 1410 10    Baker made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited
G62 1420 10    the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided
G62 1430  9    for broad zones around the camps in which prostitution
G62 1440  4    was outlawed. Even so Fosdick, as the new Chairman
G62 1450  2    of the Commission on Training Camp Activities, encountered
G62 1460  1    strong and vociferous opposition. New Orleans had a
G62 1460  9    notorious red-light district extending over twenty-eight
G62 1470  6    city blocks, and the business-minded mayor of the city
G62 1480  5    journeyed to Washington to present the case for "the
G62 1490  4    God-given right of men to be men". In Europe, Premier
G62 1500  1    Clemenceau, showing his animal proclivities as the
G62 1500  8    "Tiger of France", asked Pershing by letter for the
G62 1510  8    creation of special houses where the sexual desires
G62 1520  5    of American men could be satisfied. When Fosdick showed
G62 1530  3    the letter to Baker his negative response was: "For
G62 1540  1    God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the President
G62 1540 10    or he'll stop the war". Ultimately Fosdick's "Fit to
G62 1550  9    fight" slogan swept across the country and every well-known
G62 1560 10    red-light district in the United States was closed,
G62 1570  7    a hundred and ten of them. The result was that the
G62 1580  5    rate of venereal disease in the American Army was the
G62 1590  3    lowest in our military history.
G62 1590  8       This was the negative side of the situation. Affirmatively
G62 1600  6    Baker worked on the premise that "young men spontaneously
G62 1610  4    prefer to be decent, and that opportunities for wholesome
G62 1620  3    recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities
G62 1630  1    in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser
G62 1630 10    temptations". The wholesome activities were to be provided
G62 1640  8    by many organizations including the YMCA, the Knights
G62 1650  5    of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, the American
G62 1660  4    Library Association, and the Playground and Recreation
G62 1670  2    Association- private societies which voluntarily performed
G62 1680  1    the job that was taken over almost entirely by the
G62 1680 11    Special Services Division of the Army itself in World
G62 1690  8    War II. Over these voluntary agencies, in 1917-18,
G62 1700  6    the CTCA served as a co-ordinating body in carrying
G62 1710  4    out what Survey called "the most stupendous piece of
G62 1720  3    social work in modern times". Under Fosdick the first
G62 1730  1    executive officer of the CTCA was Richard Byrd, whose
G62 1730 10    name in later years was to become synonymous with activities
G62 1740  9    at the polar antipodes. From the point of view of popularity
G62 1750  8    the best-known member of the Commission was Walter
G62 1760  5    Camp, the Yale athlete whose sobriquet was "the father
G62 1770  4    of American football". He was placed in charge of athletics,
G62 1780  2    and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics
G62 1780 11    known as the daily dozen. The CTCA program of activities
G62 1790 10    was profuse: William Farnum and Mary Pickford on the
G62 1800  8    screen, Elsie Janis and Harry Lauder on the stage,
G62 1810  7    books provided by the American Library Association,
G62 1820  3    full equipment for games and sports- except that no
G62 1830  2    "bones" were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime
G62 1830 11    played on any floor and known as "African golf". The
G62 1840 10    CTCA distributed a khaki-bound songbook that provided
G62 1850  7    the impetus for spirited renditions of the selections
G62 1860  5    found therein, plus a number of others whose lyrics
G62 1870  3    were more earthy- from "Johnny Get Your Gun" to "Keep
G62 1880  2    the Home Fires Burning" to "Mademoiselle from Armentieres".
