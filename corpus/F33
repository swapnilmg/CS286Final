F33 0010  1       In a few school districts one finds a link between
F33 0010 11    school and job. In those vocational programs organized
F33 0020  7    with Smith-Hughes money, there may be a close tie between
F33 0030  8    the labor union and a local employer on the one hand
F33 0040  5    and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases
F33 0050  1    a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program,
F33 0050 10    saving a year because of his vocational courses in
F33 0060  9    grades 11 and 12. The apprentice program will involve
F33 0070  4    further education on a part-time basis, usually at
F33 0080  2    night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of
F33 0080 11    the high school. These opportunities are to be found
F33 0090  8    in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics,
F33 0100  5    carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die
F33 0110  1    work, and sheet-metal work.
F33 0110  6       Formally organized vocational programs supported
F33 0120  3    by federal funds allow high school students to gain
F33 0130  2    experience in a field of work which is likely to lead
F33 0130 13    to a full-time job on graduation. The "diversified
F33 0140  6    occupations" program is a part-time trade-preparatory
F33 0150  5    program conducted over two school years on a cooperative
F33 0160  3    basis between the school and local industrial and business
F33 0170  1    employers. The "distributive education" program operates
F33 0170  7    in a similar way, with arrangements between the school
F33 0180  9    and employers in merchandising fields. In both cases
F33 0190  5    the student attends school half-time and works in a
F33 0200  5    regular job the other half. He receives remuneration
F33 0210  1    for his work. In a few places cooperative programs
F33 0210 10    between schools and employers in clerical work have
F33 0220  7    shown the same possibilities for allowing the student,
F33 0230  3    while still in school, to develop skills which are
F33 0240  1    immediately marketable upon graduation.
F33 0240  5       Adult education courses, work-study programs of
F33 0250  5    various sorts- these are all evidence of a continuing
F33 0260  3    interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities
F33 0270  1    for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may
F33 0270 11    be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school,
F33 0280 12    the school authorities play little or no part in the
F33 0290  8    decision of what happens next. If the student drops
F33 0300  3    out of high school, the break with the school is even
F33 0310  1    more complete. When there is employment opportunity
F33 0310  8    for youth, this arrangement- or lack of arrangement-
F33 0320  5    works out quite well. Indeed, in some periods of our
F33 0330  6    history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities
F33 0340  1    have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys
F33 0340 11    who were potential members of the professions quit
F33 0350  7    school at an early age and went to work. Statistically
F33 0360  5    this has represented a loss to the nation, although
F33 0370  2    one must admit that in an individual case the decision
F33 0370 12    in retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt
F33 0380 12    to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being
F33 0390  7    of a man who went to work on graduation from high school
F33 0400  6    and was highly successful in the business which he
F33 0410  3    entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his
F33 0420  1    classmate who went on to a college and professional
F33 0420 10    school. But in the next decades the nation needs to
F33 0430  8    educate for the professions all the potential professional
F33 0440  4    talent.
F33 0440  5       In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school,
F33 0450  5    I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program
F33 0460  3    for the academically talented and highly gifted youth
F33 0460 11    in any high school where he is found. In the Negro
F33 0470 10    neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed
F33 0480  7    neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification
F33 0490  2    and motivation. High motivation towards higher education
F33 0500  1    must start early enough so that by the time the boy
F33 0500 12    or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed
F33 0510 10    those basic skills which are essential for academic
F33 0520  4    work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower
F33 0530  2    grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However,
F33 0530 11    the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the
F33 0540 11    community and the family is anti-intellectual. And
F33 0550  5    the fact remains that there are today few shining examples
F33 0560  3    of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.
F33 0570  1    This is not due to any policy of discrimination on
F33 0570 11    the part of the Northern universities. Quite the contrary,
F33 0580  5    as I can testify from personal experience as a former
F33 0590  5    university president. Rather we see here another vicious
F33 0600  3    circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world
F33 0610  1    of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down
F33 0610 10    enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers.
F33 0620  6    I believe the situation is improving, but the success
F33 0630  4    stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again we
F33 0640  2    run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to
F33 0640 12    be designated as Negroes in the press. How can the
F33 0650  9    vicious circle be broken? This is a problem to which
F33 0660  6    leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, should devote
F33 0670  3    far more attention. It is at least as important as
F33 0670 13    the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of
F33 0680  9    inequality in the South.
F33 0690  1    #VOCATIONAL EDUCATION#
F33 0690  3    I should like to underline four points I made in my
F33 0700  5    first report with respect to vocational education.
F33 0700 12    First and foremost, vocational courses should not replace
F33 0710  8    courses which are essential parts of the required academic
F33 0720  8    program for graduation. Second, vocational courses
F33 0730  3    should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require
F33 0740  3    more than half the student's time in those years; however,
F33 0750  1    for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses
F33 0750  9    ought to begin earlier. Third, the significance of
F33 0760  7    the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly
F33 0770  6    interested in the work; they realize the relevance
F33 0780  3    of what they are learning to their future careers,
F33 0780 12    and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic
F33 0790 10    courses which they are studying at the same time. Fourth,
F33 0800  8    the type of vocational training programs should be
F33 0810  4    related to the employment opportunities in the general
F33 0820  2    locality. This last point is important because if high
F33 0820 11    school pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates
F33 0830  9    who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained
F33 0840  5    a job as a consequence of the training, the whole idea
F33 0850  4    of relevance disappears. Vocational training which
F33 0860  1    holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact
F33 0860 12    a marketable skill becomes just another school "chore"
F33 0870  7    for those whose interest in their studies has begun
F33 0880  6    to falter. Those who, because of population mobility
F33 0890  2    and the reputed desire of employers to train their
F33 0890 11    own employees, would limit vocational education to
F33 0900  6    general rather than specific skills ought to bear in
F33 0910  6    mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school
F33 0920  3    experience.
F33 0920  4       I have been using the word "vocational" as a layman
F33 0930  4    would at first sight think it should be used. I intend
F33 0940  1    to include under the term all the practical courses
F33 0940 10    open to boys and girls. These courses develop skills
F33 0950  7    other than those we think of when we use the adjective
F33 0960  6    "academic". Practically all of these practical skills
F33 0970  2    are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be
F33 0970 14    obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth
F33 0980  9    to get a job at once on the basis of the skill. They
F33 0990  9    are in this sense skills marketable immediately on
F33 1000  3    graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die
F33 1010  1    work and in the building trades, the first job must
F33 1010 11    be often on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time
F33 1020 11    vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate
F33 1030  8    one year of apprentice status. Similarly, a girl who
F33 1040  5    graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography
F33 1050  1    and the use of clerical machines and who is able to
F33 1050 12    get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and
F33 1060 10    knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community
F33 1070  7    college or secretarial school. Of course, it can be
F33 1080  4    argued that an ability to write English correctly and
F33 1090  1    with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.
F33 1090 10    So, too, is the mathematical competence of a college
F33 1100  5    graduate who has majored in mathematics. In a sense
F33 1110  4    almost all high school and college courses could be
F33 1120  1    considered as vocational to the extent that later in
F33 1120 10    life the student in his vocation (which may be a profession)
F33 1130  9    will be called upon to use some of the skills developed
F33 1140  6    and the competence obtained. In spite of the shading
F33 1150  4    of one type of course into another, I believe it is
F33 1150 15    useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from
F33 1160  9    academic courses. Perhaps a course in typewriting might
F33 1170  7    be regarded as the exception which proves the rule.
F33 1180  4    Today many college bound students try to take a course
F33 1190  2    in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of
F33 1190 12    mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who
F33 1200  9    proposes to do academic work in college and a professional
F33 1210  6    school.
F33 1210  7       Most of our largest cities have one or more separate
F33 1220  7    vocational or technical high schools. In this respect,
F33 1230  4    public education in the large cities differs from education
F33 1240  1    in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts.
F33 1240  9    The neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking,
F33 1250  8    comprehensive schools, because some of the boys and
F33 1260  7    girls may be attending a vocational or technical high
F33 1270  4    school instead of the local school. Indeed, one school
F33 1280  2    superintendent in a large city objects to the use of
F33 1280 12    the term comprehensive high school for the senior high
F33 1290  7    schools in his city, because these schools do not offer
F33 1300  6    strictly vocational programs. He prefers to designate
F33 1310  3    such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban
F33 1320  1    high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely
F33 1320 12    comprehensive high school because of the absence of
F33 1330  8    vocational programs. The reason is that there is a
F33 1350  6    lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore
F33 1360  1    employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan
F33 1370  1    area are related in different ways from those which
F33 1370 10    are characteristic of the comprehensive high school
F33 1380  6    described in my first report.
F33 1390  1       The separate vocational or technical high schools
F33 1390  8    in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions.
F33 1400  7    By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected
F33 1410  4    both to the employment situation and to the realities
F33 1420  4    of the apprentice system. It is not often realized
F33 1430  1    to what degree certain trades are in many communities
F33 1430 10    closed areas of employment, except for a lucky few.
F33 1440  7    One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors
F33 1450  5    of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot
F33 1460  3    just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing
F33 1470  1    good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in
F33 1470 12    many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice
F33 1480  7    program which involves union approval than to get into
F33 1490  5    the most selective medical school in the nation. Two
F33 1500  2    stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational
F33 1500 12    instructor in a city vocational school, speaking of
F33 1510  8    his course in a certain field, said he had no difficulty
F33 1520  7    placing all students in jobs outside of the city. In
F33 1530  5    the city, he said, the waiting list for those who want
F33 1540  3    to join the union is so long that unless a boy has
F33 1540 15    an inside track he can't get in. In a far distant part
F33 1550 11    of the United States, I was talking to an instructor
F33 1560  7    about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special
F33 1570  4    work. "What does he have in mind to do when he graduates"?
F33 1580  2    "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But isn't
F33 1590  2    it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked.
F33 1600  1    "He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very
F33 1600 11    good connections".
F33 1610  2       In my view, there should be a school which offers
F33 1620  1    significant vocational programs for boys within easy
F33 1620  8    reach of every family in a city. Ideally these schools
F33 1630  8    should be so located that one or more should be in
F33 1640  7    the area where demand for practical courses is at the
F33 1650  3    highest.
F33 1650  4       An excellent example of a successful location of
F33 1660  2    a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational
F33 1660 11    High School in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area
F33 1670  9    now undergoing redevelopment, this school and its program
F33 1680  6    are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its
F33 1690  4    students. Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar
F33 1710  1    first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major
F33 1710 11    problem in many slum areas). I discovered in the course
F33 1720  8    of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes.
F33 1730  6    They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing,
F33 1740  4    bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics,
F33 1750  1    and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at
F33 1750  8    Dunbar are impressive, but more impressive is the attitude
F33 1760  8    of the pupils.
