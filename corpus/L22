L22 0010  1    In good time I shall get to the distressing actuality,
L22 0010 11    to Red McIver and Handley Walker, to murder and sudden
L22 0020  8    death. But you realize, I am sure, how much old deeds
L22 0030  8    incite to new ones, and you must forgive me if I tell
L22 0040  5    you first of the old ones.
L22 0040 11       It was in 1814 that Abraham Wharf and his sister
L22 0050  6    sat by a meager fire in their house on Dogtown Common,
L22 0060  4    a desolate place even then. He was sharpening his razor.
L22 0070  2    "Sister", said he "do you think people who commit suicide
L22 0080  1    go to heaven"? and she answered, "I don't know, but
L22 0080 11    I hope you'll never do such a thing". Without a tremor,
L22 0090 10    "God forbid"! he said, and went out and cut his throat
L22 0100 10    in the cave near Granny Day's swamp.
L22 0110  3       What has this to do with the present? Much, I assure
L22 0120  3    you. You must know what gets into people, even such
L22 0120 13    as Red and Handley, before you can tell what comes
L22 0130 10    out of them. They had learned, both of them, about
L22 0140  7    Abraham Wharf. That's why I beg you not to forget him.
L22 0150  6    His ghost is not laid. Red and Handley, God help them,
L22 0160  3    knew the old Dogtown lore; and I knew they knew it,
L22 0160 14    for I'd told them a lot of it. And isn't it true that
L22 0170 13    you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives
L22 0180  8    when you know what it is he knows?
L22 0190  3       Yes, gentlemen, I am getting to the point, to my
L22 0200  1    point. You know the facts; they are set forth in your
L22 0200 12    own newspapers. You want from me the story, but a story
L22 0210 10    is about 'why' and then, perhaps, about 'how'. The
L22 0220  5    'when' you know; yesterday morning. So what I am trying
L22 0230  6    to tell you is the 'why'- that is my point- and that
L22 0240  3    concerns the spirit of the matter. There is an inwardness
L22 0250  2    and a luster to old furniture (look at that mahogany
L22 0250 12    highboy behind you) which has a provocative emanation,
L22 0260  8    if I may say so. Places, too, have their haunting qualities.
L22 0270  6    Even people. And my point in this sad story is the
L22 0280  7    spirit of the matter. When you hold the spirit of a
L22 0290  3    thing, then somehow you know the truth- you know a
L22 0290 13    fake antique from the real thing. And the truth is
L22 0300  9    what you've come for, is it not?
L22 0310  3       Now, Dogtown is one of those places that creeps
L22 0310 12    into the marrow as worms get into old wood, under the
L22 0320 11    veneer. In fact, all the folk who lived on the back
L22 0330  9    of Cape Ann, they are not just like others. There's
L22 0340  3    a different hall-mark on them. There were no witch
L22 0350  1    burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family.
L22 0350 11    Just think of old Granther Stannard who pulled the
L22 0360  8    teeth of Dark Younger (her real name was Dorcas), and
L22 0370  7    because he bungled the job and left two protruding
L22 0380  3    tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his
L22 0380 15    legs were made of glass. After that he was never known
L22 0390 11    to run or even walk fast. Today Dogtown is the only
L22 0400  7    deserted village in all New England that I know of.
L22 0410  5    There it sits, a small highland, with towns like Gloucester
L22 0420  2    near by; but now it's the most lost and tortured place
L22 0430  1    in the world. Those who lived in that desolation of
L22 0430 11    rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony
L22 0440  8    character. Scientists say it is the last spewings of
L22 0450  6    a great glacier, but one rather feels that only a malevolent
L22 0460  3    giant could have piled up those crouching monsters
L22 0460 11    of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended,
L22 0470 10    ominous life in them.
L22 0480  3       We'll walk up there later. It's perhaps a mile from
L22 0490  1    here where we sit. And not one single dwelling left
L22 0490 11    there, though once, in the early eighteenth century,
L22 0500  7    there were close to a hundred houses. (I myself have
L22 0510  5    identified about sixty sites, from the old maps and
L22 0520  2    registers. A fascinating pursuit, I assure you.) Even
L22 0520 10    I can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled
L22 0530  8    pillars, and nobody has lived there in the memory of
L22 0540  7    any living man. It is now a sweep of boulders and ledges,
L22 0550  3    with oak, walnut and sumac creeping across the common,
L22 0560  1    and everywhere the ruins and the long, long shadows.
L22 0560 10       That's your setting, and a sinister one. Please
L22 0570  8    get that in your reports. It accounts for so many things.
L22 0580  7    Both Red McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby, almost
L22 0590  4    as near as I do. Red lived at Lanesville, and from
L22 0600  3    his house he could be up on the Common in a half hour's
L22 0610  1    brisk walk; Handley lived further on, at Pigeon Cove.
L22 0610 10    I'd often find one or other of them up around Dogtown
L22 0620 10    sketching. They were both painters, (They were? They
L22 0640  5    are? What should one say?) Well, anyhow, Dogtown Common
L22 0650  4    is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only
L22 0660  3    Sunday picnickers still stray up there, from time to
L22 0670  1    time. Sea-road, railroad, lack of water, killed Dogtown.
L22 0670 10    Dead, dead as a brass door nail, and I sometimes feel
L22 0680 10    like the Sexton, for I'm about the last to be even
L22 0690  7    interested.
L22 0690  8       I knew Red and Handley well. As I said, they were
L22 0700  7    both painters. They'd come, separately, to Gloucester
L22 0710  3    some twenty years ago- there's always been an artists'
L22 0720  2    colony somewhere on Cape Ann- and each married here.
L22 0730  1    They married cousins, Anta and Freya Norberg. There
L22 0730  9    are a lot of Scandinavians in this neck of the woods,
L22 0740  8    and many still make painted furniture and take steam-baths.
L22 0750  6    Pretty girls among them, with blonde hair and pert
L22 0760  4    faces. Handley married Freya and Red, of the red beard,
L22 0770  1    married Anta. And it was because of an old Norberg
L22 0770 11    inheritance that I got to understand them all so well.
L22 0780  9    The quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw, but I must
L22 0790  5    tell you about it. Oh, yes, I'm quite sure it's important,
L22 0800  3    because of the Beech Pasture. What's that? Why, that's
L22 0810  3    what gave me the feeling, gave me as-it-were the spirit,
L22 0820  1    the demoniac, evil spirit of this whole affair.
L22 0820  9       You see, besides being custodian of antiquities,
L22 0830  5    I am also registrar. No, I don't hold with those who
L22 0840  5    live entirely among dead things. I know as well as
L22 0850  3    the next man that a ship is called from the rigging
L22 0850 14    she carries, where the live wind blows, and not from
L22 0860  9    the hull. But you've got to know both. What's below
L22 0870  6    the water-line interests me also. As I was saying,
L22 0880  3    I've known all about the old records, including the
L22 0880 12    old Norberg deed. Some ten years ago that page was
L22 0890 10    torn out, I don't know by whom. About five years ago,
L22 0900  8    Handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered
L22 0910  5    register. He was courteous and casual about it, as
L22 0920  2    though it were of no consequence. He's always like
L22 0920 11    that, in spite of being a big man. (When you see him,
L22 0930 10    you'll notice his habit of fingering, I might almost
L22 0940  6    say, stroking a large mole with black hairs on it,
L22 0950  3    by his right temple.) A sensual man, but very courteous,
L22 0950 13    some would say slick. Like his glossy black hair. Too
L22 0960 10    many outside manners, to my taste. He is the sort who,
L22 0970  9    with an appraising eye, would cross the street to help
L22 0980  6    a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her. A real
L22 0990  3    gentleman, I feel, would do neither. He's always worn
L22 1000  1    a broad-brimmed hat, and I've noticed, in my small
L22 1000 11    study at the Society, that he rather smells of cosmetics.
L22 1010  7    The next week, cousin Red wandered in as casually,
L22 1020  5    but curt and untidy. Red was small and fine-boned,
L22 1030  1    like ivory-inlay. He too asked to see the same page.
L22 1030 12    When I told him someone had torn it out, he shouted.
L22 1040 10    "By God, it's that damn Handley, the sneak"! And later
L22 1050  7    in the same week they both came together to examine
L22 1060  5    the register. Fortunately we were alone in the building-
L22 1070  3    so few people nowadays are interested even in their
L22 1070 12    own past or in the lovely craft of other days- for
L22 1080 11    they began to abuse each other in the foulest language.
L22 1090  7    Red thrusting out his tawny beard, Handley glowering
L22 1100  3    under his suddenly rumpled black hair. They actually
L22 1110  1    bristled. Le rouge et le noir. Violent men both. Red
L22 1110 11    always was morose, yet that day the dapper Handley
L22 1120  9    was the louder of the two. But for my presence, they
L22 1130  7    would have been at each others' throats.
L22 1140  1       During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was,
L22 1140 10    from the accusations each hurled at the other. The
L22 1150  9    Beech Pasture had suddenly become valuable. There's
L22 1160  4    a fine granite quarry there, and granite's coming back
L22 1170  3    for public buildings. Both men knew it was in the Norberg
L22 1180  2    family holdings, but to which of the cousins did it
L22 1180 12    belong, Anta or Freya? Fortunately, I knew almost exactly
L22 1190  9    what the will had said. It began with a preamble, of
L22 1200  9    course. This explained that the judge of probate of
L22 1210  5    Essex County, 1785 or 1786, appointed three free-holders
L22 1220  1    of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate.
L22 1230  1    After the usual Honorable Sirs, it went on to say that
L22 1230 12    there had been set off to the widow one full third
L22 1240 10    part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg,
L22 1250  5    one lower room, on the Western side, privileges to
L22 1260  2    the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar
L22 1260 14    (I can show you the cellar when we go up), also one
L22 1270 12    Cow Right, and lastly they set off to the widow her
L22 1280  8    own land that she brought with her as dower, namely
L22 1290  3    the Beech Pasture. And I remember that the whole of
L22 1300  1    the privileges, not counting the Beech Pasture, was
L22 1300  9    valued at twenty pounds. I wish you could have seen
L22 1310  8    the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when
L22 1320  3    I told them that obviously the pasture belonged to
L22 1330  2    their wives jointly.
L22 1330  5       That battle scene, ridiculous at it was, remained
L22 1340  2    in my mind. A disturbing picture of bad blood, to be
L22 1340 13    further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors,
L22 1350  7    for on a subsequent day I saw Handley escorting Anta,
L22 1360  6    Red's wife, up on Dogtown Common. I felt it would be
L22 1370  6    inopportune to disclose my presence. Not that I intentionally
L22 1380  3    go unperceived, but the boulders up there are very
L22 1380 12    high and I am a small woman.
L22 1395  1       One other cause of jealousy between them I must
L22 1400  3    tell you. Paint! Gloomy and unkempt as Red McIver was,
L22 1410  1    he was much the better painter. I suppose Handley knew
L22 1410 11    it. If Red had a show at Gloucester, Handley would
L22 1420  8    hurry to hang his pictures in Rockport. You may say
L22 1430  5    this has little pertinence, but, gentlemen, remember
L22 1440  2    that all this prepared my mind, alerted my intelligence.
L22 1440 11    By such touches the pattern takes shape. You would
L22 1450  9    call these the motives of crime. I would call them
L22 1460  7    the patterns of life, perhaps even the designs of destiny.
L22 1470  4    Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance
L22 1480  1    to unravel our case, as you would call it, till yesterday.
L22 1490  1       One month ago, on the 20th of October, was the opening
L22 1490 12    of the gunning season in Massachusetts. Not much to
L22 1500  7    shoot, but there are a few pheasant. Rabbits, too,
L22 1510  4    if you care for them, which most of the folk around
L22 1520  2    here haven't the sense to appreciate. Any more than
L22 1520 11    they have the sense to eat mussels. That was the day
L22 1530 10    Red was said to have gone away. Oh yes, he'd talked
L22 1540  7    about doing so. In fact, he often disappeared, from
L22 1550  2    time to time,- off to paint the sea, aboard a dragger
L22 1560  1    out from Gloucester. Anta, his wife, never seemed to
L22 1560 10    mind. I suppose these absences gave her more clearance
L22 1570  7    for her embraces with Cousin Handley. Anyhow, I wasn't
L22 1580  5    surprised, early that morning, to see Handley himself
L22 1590  3    crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road.
L22 1600  2    No, he didn't have his gun, which he should have. It
L22 1600 13    would have been a good excuse for his being there at
L22 1610 11    all. I myself had been up there by seven o'clock, after
L22 1620  7    mushrooms, since there'd been a week of rain which
L22 1630  5    had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear
L22 1640  1    as Sandwich glass.
