A21 0010  1    _ST. JOHNS, MICH., APRIL 19._
A21 0010  6       - A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old
A21 0020  6    Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the
A21 0030  3    bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach.
A21 0030  9       Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion.
A21 0040  7    He returned to his cell in the county jail, where he
A21 0050  7    has been held since his arrest last July, without a
A21 0060  3    word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker,
A21 0060 11    or his guard.
A21 0070  2    #STEPSON VINDICATED#
A21 0070  4    The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's
A21 0080  4    stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried for
A21 0090  2    the same crime in December, 1958, and released when
A21 0090 11    the jury failed to reach a verdict. Mrs. Hengesbach
A21 0100  7    was killed on Aug. 31, 1958.
A21 0110  1       Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since.
A21 0110 10    When the verdict came in against his young neighbor,
A21 0120  9    Hengesbach said:
A21 0130  1       "I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion
A21 0130 11    removed. Still, I don't wish to appear happy at somebody's
A21 0140  9    else's misfortune".
A21 0150  1    #LIVES ON WELFARE#
A21 0150  4    Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare recently,
A21 0160  2    said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled
A21 0160 12    by his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest
A21 0170  8    of here.
A21 0180  1       Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since
A21 0180  8    his house and barn were burned down after his release
A21 0190  6    in 1958.
A21 0190  8       Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned
A21 0200  5    about several fires in the Westphalia area by State
A21 0210  3    Police.
A21 0210  4       He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach. However,
A21 0220  2    the confession, which was the only evidence against
A21 0220 10    him, was retracted before the trial.
A21 0230  6    #CHARGES IN DOUBT#
A21 0230  9    Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis, who tried both the
A21 0240  7    Hengesbach and Pohl cases, said he did not know what
A21 0250  7    would be done about two arson charges pending against
A21 0260  2    Pohl.
A21 0260  3       Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for
A21 0270  4    sentencing. Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in
A21 0270 14    prison or probation.
A21 0280  3       Walker said he was considering filing a motion for
A21 0290  2    a new trial which would contend that the verdict was
A21 0290 12    against the weight of the evidence and that there were
A21 0300  9    several errors in trial procedure.
A21 0310  2    #LOCKED IN MOTEL#
A21 0310  5    A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost
A21 0320  4    13-1/2 hours of deliberation. The jury, which was locked
A21 0330  3    up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request
A21 0330 13    of Walker after the verdict was announced.
A21 0340  7       The jury foreman, Mrs. Olive Heideman, of rural
A21 0350  5    Elsie, said that a ballot was not even taken until
A21 0360  3    yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation
A21 0370  1    was spent in going over the evidence.
A21 0370  8       She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession
A21 0380  4    was valid.
A21 0380  6       The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written
A21 0390  7    definition of the difference between first and second-degree
A21 0400  4    murder and manslaughter.
A21 0400  7       The verdict came three hours later.
A21 0410  4       Some 30 spectators remained in the court during
A21 0420  1    the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read.
A21 0420 12    The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than
A21 0430  8    a week.
A21 0440  1       A Sterling Township family of six surviving children,
A21 0440  9    whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire
A21 0450 10    that also killed one of the children, found today they
A21 0460  7    had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends.
A21 0470  4       While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's
A21 0480  3    duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a
A21 0480 12    homeowners association and a student council for the
A21 0490  8    hard-hit Henry Kowalski family, 34220 Viceroy.
A21 0500  4       Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski, 42, died yesterday afternoon
A21 0510  4    in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire
A21 0520  4    that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night
A21 0520 12    at the flat of her widowed mother, Mrs. Mary Pankowski,
A21 0530  9    in the adjoining suburb of Warren.
A21 0540  4    #SERVICES TOMORROW#
A21 0540  6    Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter,
A21 0550  5    Christine, 11, who died of burns at the same hospital
A21 0560  4    Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in
A21 0570  2    St. Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.
A21 0575  1       The mother and daughter, who will be buried side
A21 0580  9    by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, rested together today
A21 0590  5    in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home,
A21 0600  3    31730 Mound, Warren.
A21 0600  6       Mrs. Pankowski, 61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital
A21 0610  7    as a result of the explosion, which occurred while
A21 0620  4    Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's
A21 0630  1    small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east.
A21 0630 10    #HELD CANDLE#
A21 0640  2    Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes
A21 0650  1    apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the
A21 0650 11    three Kowalski girls present held for her mother, because
A21 0660  8    the flat lacked electricity.
A21 0670  1       Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski,
A21 0680  1    8, escaped with minor burns. They are home now with
A21 0680 11    the other Kowalski children, Vicky, 14; Dennis, 6;
A21 0690  6    Eleanor, 2; and Bernardine, 1.
A21 0700  2       "All we have left in the world is one another, and
A21 0700 13    we must stay together the way Mother wanted", Kowalski
A21 0710  9    said in telling his children of their mother's death
A21 0720  7    yesterday afternoon.
A21 0730  1       Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter,
A21 0730  8    already was in arrears on their recently purchased
A21 0740  5    split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with
A21 0750  3    medical and funeral bills.
A21 0750  7    #$135 DONATED#
A21 0750  9    Neighbor women, such as Mrs. Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra,
A21 0760  9    Sterling Township, have been supplying the family with
A21 0770  7    meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's
A21 0780  3    sister-in-law, Mrs. Anna Kowalski, 22111 David, East
A21 0790  3    Detroit.
A21 0790  4       Another neighbor, Mrs. Frank C. Smith, 2731 Pall
A21 0800  4    Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by coming
A21 0810  2    to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward
A21 0810 11    the $400 funeral costs.
A21 0820  4       John C. Houghton, president of the Tareytown Acres
A21 0830  2    Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing
A21 0830  8    plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout
A21 0840 11    their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family.
A21 0850  7    #STUDENTS HELP OUT#
A21 0850 10    Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass
A21 0860 11    of all 480 homes in the subdivision, which is located
A21 0870  7    northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile road east. He said
A21 0880  6    contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box
A21 0890  3    553, Warren Village Station.
A21 0890  7       Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of
A21 0900  6    her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her
A21 0910  4    family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann
A21 0910 12    Junior High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.
A21 0920  8       Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a
A21 0930  9    further collection between classes today, and revealed
A21 0940  5    that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide
A21 0950  5    a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski.
A21 0960  1    #FUNDS FROM DANCES#
A21 0960  4    Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski
A21 0970  4    family would be given the combined proceeds from a
A21 0980  2    school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance
A21 0980 11    for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night.
A21 0990  6       "Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been
A21 1000  5    a spontaneous effort, started largely among the students
A21 1010  2    themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy
A21 1010 10    for her entire family, Pohly said.
A21 1020  6       There also were reports of a collection at the County
A21 1030  5    Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre, which has
A21 1040  3    been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children
A21 1040 13    including Christine.
A21 1050  2    #EXPRESSES THANKS#
A21 1050  4    Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last
A21 1060  6    Saturday. But today he wanted to make a public statement.
A21 1070  2       "I never knew there were such neighbors and friends
A21 1080  2    around me and my family. I wasn't sure there were such
A21 1080 13    people anywhere in the world. I'll need more than a
A21 1090 10    single day to find the words to properly express my
A21 1100  7    thanks to them".
A21 1110  1       An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated
A21 1110 11    by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless
A21 1120  9    driving conviction against a youthful motorist.
A21 1130  4       Patrolman George Kimmell, of McClellan Station,
A21 1140  2    said he would recommend a special safety citation for
A21 1150  1    Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the
A21 1150 11    Scripps School, for his assistance in the case.
A21 1160  7       Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children
A21 1170  4    across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when
A21 1180  2    a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly
A21 1180 10    inside the pedestrian crosswalk.
A21 1190  3    #GETS CAR NUMBER#
A21 1190  6    Kimmell ordered the driver to back up, watched the
A21 1200  6    children safely across and was approaching the car
A21 1210  3    when it suddenly "took off at high speed", he said,
A21 1210 13    narrowly missing him.
A21 1220  3       Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued the
A21 1230  2    fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic. Returning
A21 1230 10    to the school crossing, the officer was informed by
A21 1240  7    the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver, a neighbor,
A21 1250  5    and had obtained the license number.
A21 1260  1       The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees,
A21 1260  8    17, of 2433 McClellan, currently on probation and under
A21 1270  6    court order not to drive.
A21 1280  1    #GIVEN 15 DAYS#
A21 1280  4    He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by
A21 1290  2    Traffic Judge George T. Murphy, who continued his no-driving
A21 1300  1    probation for another year and ordered him to spend
A21 1300 10    15 days in the Detroit House of Correction. The jail
A21 1310  6    sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates
A21 1320  4    from Eastern High School in June.
A21 1330  1       The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown
A21 1330 10    today.
A21 1340  1       Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union
A21 1340 10    to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire.
A21 1350  7    #HELP ASKED#
A21 1350  9    In Vientiane, the royal Laotian government decided
A21 1360  6    today to ask its "friends and neighbors" for help in
A21 1370  5    fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening
A21 1380  2    the southeast Asian kingdom.
A21 1380  6       Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire
A21 1390  9    timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary
A21 1400  5    Lord Home.
A21 1400  7       He said Britain also proposed that the international
A21 1410  5    truce commission should be reconvened, sent to New
A21 1420  4    Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.
A21 1430  1       A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on
A21 1430 11    May 5, he said.
A21 1440  3    #PLEA FOR ARMS#
A21 1440  6    The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign
A21 1450  4    Minister Tiao Sopsaisana. He indicated that requests
A21 1460  1    would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military
A21 1470  1    advisers.
A21 1470  2       He declared the government is thinking of asking
A21 1480  1    for foreign troops if the situation worsens.
A21 1480  8       One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision
A21 1490  7    was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged
A21 1500  6    military assistance group instead of the current civilian
A21 1510  3    body.
A21 1510  4       A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador
A21 1520  3    Winthrop G. Brown.
A21 1520  6    #HEAVY SUPPORT#
A21 1520  8    The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel
A21 1530  9    attacks had been launched, heavily supported by troops
A21 1540  6    from Communist North Viet Nam.
A21 1550  1       The minister, describing the attacks which led up
A21 1550  9    to the appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese
A21 1560  8    were fighting royal army troops on one front- near
A21 1570  7    Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.
A21 1580  1       There was no confirmation of such massive assaults
A21 1580  9    from independent sources. In the past such government
A21 1590  7    claims have been found exaggerated.
A21 1610  1    _HAVANA, APRIL 19._
A21 1610  4       - Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by
A21 1620  2    firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began
A21 1620 10    decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces
A21 1630  8    and suspected collaborators.
A21 1640  1       A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans
A21 1650  1    as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair.
A21 1650  8       The executions took place at dawn only a few hours
A21 1660  9    after Havana radio announced their conviction by a
A21 1670  4    revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio, where the
A21 1680  1    executions took place.
A21 1680  4    #ARMS PLOT CHARGED#
A21 1680  7    The broadcast said Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and
A21 1690  7    Havana businessman, and McNair, of Miami, were condemned
A21 1700  5    on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.
A21 1710  1       Anderson operated three Havana automobile service
A21 1710  7    stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion
A21 1720  9    post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's
A21 1730  7    regime.
A21 1730  8       Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami.
A21 1740  8       McNair, 25, was seized March 20 with four Cubans
A21 1750  6    and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles
A21 1760  3    in Pinar del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana.
A21 1760 12    #REPORT OTHERS HELD#
A21 1770  3    At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been
A21 1780  2    arrested in a mass political roundup.
A21 1780  8       Among them were a number of newsmen, including Henry
A21 1790  6    Raymont, of United Press International, and Robert
A21 1800  3    Berrellez, of Associated Press.
A21 1800  7       So many Cubans were reported being swept into the
A21 1810  8    Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium
A21 1820  5    and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift
A21 1830  3    jails. More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested-
A21 1840  3    100 of them Roman Catholic priests.
A21 1850  1       Of the millions who have served time in concentration
A21 1850 10    camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet
A21 1860  8    state, few emerge in the West to tell about it.
A21 1870  6       M. Kegham- the name is a pseudynom- was a teacher
A21 1880  6    in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary
A21 1890  1    Federation (ARF)- two reasons the Communists put him
A21 1900  1    away when they arrived in 1945.
A21 1900  7       Today, M. Kegham was in Detroit, en route to join
A21 1910  5    his wife and children in California.
