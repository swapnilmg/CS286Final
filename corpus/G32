G32 0010  1       This time he was making no mistake. Olgivanna- in
G32 0010 10    her country the nickname was a respectful form of address-
G32 0020  8    was not only attractive but shrewd, durable, sensible,
G32 0030  4    and smart. No wonder Wright was enchanted- no two better
G32 0040  6    suited people ever met. Almost from that day, until
G32 0050  1    his death, Olgivanna was to stay at his side; but the
G32 0050 12    years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily
G32 0060  7    trying, both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady.
G32 0070  5       It must be granted that the flouting of convention,
G32 0080  3    no matter how well intentioned one may be, is sure
G32 0090  1    to lead to trouble, or at least to the discomfort that
G32 0090 12    goes with social disapproval. Even so, many of the
G32 0100  7    things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately
G32 0110  5    severe. Their afflictions centered on one maddening
G32 0120  4    difficulty: Miriam held up the divorce proceedings
G32 0130  1    that she herself had asked for. Reporters began to
G32 0130 10    trail Miriam everywhere, and to encourage her to make
G32 0140  7    appalling statements about Wright and his doings. Flocks
G32 0150  5    of writs, attachments, and unpleasant legal papers
G32 0160  2    of every sort began to fly through the air. The distracted
G32 0160 13    Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal
G32 0170  9    representative, then change her mind and make another
G32 0180  7    attack on Wright as a person. At last her lawyer, Arthur
G32 0190  5    D. Cloud, gave up the case because she turned down
G32 0200  3    three successive settlements he arranged. Cloud made
G32 0200 10    an interesting statement in parting from his client:
G32 0210  7    "I wanted to be a lawyer, and Mrs. Wright wanted me
G32 0220  8    to be an avenging angel. So I got out. Mrs. Wright
G32 0230  5    is without funds. The first thing to do is get her
G32 0240  3    some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending
G32 0240 12    a final disposition of the case. But every time I suggested
G32 0250 10    this to her, Mrs. Wright turned it down and demanded
G32 0260  8    that I go out and punish Mr. Wright. I am an attorney,
G32 0270  7    not an instrument of vengeance". Miriam Noel disregarded
G32 0280  4    the free advice of her departing counselor, and appointed
G32 0290  3    a heavy-faced young man named Harold Jackson to take
G32 0300  1    his place.
G32 0300  3       There were three years of this strange warfare;
G32 0310  1    and during the unhappy time, Miriam often would charge
G32 0310 10    that Wright and Olgivanna were misdemeanants against
G32 0320  5    the public order of Wisconsin. Yet somehow, when officers
G32 0330  5    were prodded into visiting Taliesin to execute the
G32 0340  3    warrants, they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna
G32 0350  1    at home. This showed that common sense had not died
G32 0350 11    out at the county and village level- though why the
G32 0360  7    unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained
G32 0370  5    remains a puzzle. The misery of Miriam's bitterness
G32 0380  2    can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it
G32 0380 13    was hopeless, agonizing, and destructive, with Miriam
G32 0390  7    herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain.
G32 0400  7       To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin
G32 0410  3    that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna, we should
G32 0420  2    bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam
G32 0420 13    in person. One of the most distressing of these scenes
G32 0430  9    occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open
G32 0440  8    warfare, on a beautiful day in June. At this time Miriam
G32 0450  5    Noel appeared, urging on Constable Henry Pengally,
G32 0460  1    whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh
G32 0460 12    settlers in the neighborhood. A troop of reporters
G32 0470  8    brought up the rear. Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin
G32 0480  6    gate, and William Weston, now the estate foreman, came
G32 0490  4    out to parley. He said that Mr. Wright was not in,
G32 0500  3    and so could not be arrested on something called a
G32 0500 13    peace warrant that Miriam was waving in the air. Miriam
G32 0510  9    now ordered Pengally to break down the gate, but he
G32 0520  7    said he really couldn't go that far. At this point
G32 0530  3    Mrs. Frances Cupply, one of Wright's handsome daughters
G32 0540  1    by his first wife, came from the house and tried to
G32 0540 12    calm Miriam as she tore down a NO VISITORS sign and
G32 0550 10    smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock.
G32 0560  7       Miriam Noel Wright said, "Here I am at my own home,
G32 0570  7    locked out so I must stand in the road"! Then she rounded
G32 0580  4    on Weston and cried, "You always did Wright's dirty
G32 0590  2    work! When I take over Taliesin, the first thing I'll
G32 0600  1    do is fire you".
G32 0600  5       "Madame Noel, I think you had better go", said Mrs.
G32 0610  4    Cupply.
G32 0610  5       "And I think you had better leave", replied Miriam.
G32 0620  4    Turning to the reporters, she asked, "Did you hear
G32 0630  3    her? 'I think you had better leave'! And this is my
G32 0640  3    own home". In the silence that followed, Miriam walked
G32 0640 12    close to Mrs. Cupply, who drew back a step on her side
G32 0650 12    of the gate. Then, with staring eyes and lips drawn
G32 0660  7    thin, Miriam said to the young woman, "You are ugly-
G32 0670  4    uglier than you used to be, and you were always very
G32 0680  2    ugly. You are even uglier than Mr. Wright".
G32 0680 10       The animosity expressed by such a scene had the
G32 0690  9    penetrating quality of a natural force; and it gave
G32 0700  6    Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person
G32 0710  4    inspired to complete some great and universal work
G32 0710 12    of art. As if to make certain that Wright would be
G32 0720 10    unable to pay any settlement at all, Miriam wrote to
G32 0730  6    prospective clients denouncing him; she also went to
G32 0740  4    Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris
G32 0750  2    of Nebraska, the Fighting Liberal, from whose office
G32 0750 10    a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard. Then,
G32 0760  7    after overtures to accept a settlement and go through
G32 0770  7    with a divorce, Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs.
G32 0780  4    Micawber by suddenly stating, "I will never leave Mr.
G32 0790  2    Wright".
G32 0790  3       Under this kind of pressure, it is not surprising
G32 0800  2    that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers.
G32 0810  1    Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly,
G32 0810 11    but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright's
G32 0820  8    remarks to reporters when he was asked, one morning
G32 0830  7    on arrival in Chicago, what he thought of the city
G32 0840  4    as a whole. First, Wright said, he was choked by the
G32 0840 15    smoke, which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful
G32 0850  9    town. But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome? "That
G32 0860  6    isn't a boulevard, it's a racetrack"! cried Wright,
G32 0870  5    showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger
G32 0880  5    as early as the 1920's. "This is a horrible way to
G32 0890  3    live", Wright went on. "You are being strangled by
G32 0890 12    traffic". He was then asked for a solution of the difficulty,
G32 0900 11    and began to talk trenchant sense, though private anguish
G32 0910  8    showed through in the vehemence of his manner. "Take
G32 0920  6    a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop", Wright
G32 0930  4    said. "Cut off every building at the seventh floor.
G32 0940  2    Spread everything out. You don't need concentration.
G32 0940  9    If you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have
G32 0950  9    no more traffic jams. You'll have trees again. You'll
G32 0960  6    have some joy in the life of this city. After all,
G32 0970  5    that's the job of the architect- to give the world
G32 0975  3    a little joy".
G32 0980  1       Little enough joy was afforded Wright in the spring
G32 0990  4    of 1925, when another destructive fire broke out at
G32 0990 13    Taliesin. The first news stories had it that this blaze
G32 1000 10    was started by a bolt of lightning, as though Miriam
G32 1010  8    could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of
G32 1020  5    the Old Testament. A storm did take place that night,
G32 1030  2    and fortunately enough, it included a cloudburst that
G32 1030 10    helped put out the flames. Later accounts blamed defective
G32 1040  8    wiring for starting the fire; at any rate, heat grew
G32 1050  8    so intense in the main part of the house that it melted
G32 1060  5    the window panes, and fused the K'ang-si pottery to
G32 1070  2    cinders. Wright set his loss at $200,000, a figure
G32 1070 11    perhaps justified by the unique character of the house
G32 1080  8    that had been ruined, and the faultless taste that
G32 1090  5    had gone into the selection of the prints and other
G32 1100  2    things that were destroyed. In spite of the disaster,
G32 1100 11    Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake
G32 1110  9    Tahoe resort, in which he suggested the shapes of American
G32 1120  7    Indian tepees- a project of great and appropriate charm,
G32 1130  5    that came to nothing. Amid a shortage of profitable
G32 1140  2    work, the memory of Albert Johnson's $20,000 stood
G32 1140 10    out in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted
G32 1150  9    away. A series of conferences with friends and bankers
G32 1160  6    began about this time; and the question before these
G32 1170  4    meetings was, here is a man of international reputation
G32 1180  1    and proved earning power; how can he be financed so
G32 1180 11    that he can find the work he ought to do? While this
G32 1190 11    was under consideration, dauntless as ever Wright set
G32 1200  6    about the building of Taliesin III.
G32 1210  1       As he made plans for the new Taliesin, Wright also
G32 1210 11    got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel
G32 1220  9    and glass to house a congregation of all faiths, and
G32 1230  5    the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp. Years
G32 1240  3    were to pass before these plans came off the paper,
G32 1240 13    and Wright was justified in thinking, as the projects
G32 1250  9    failed, that much of what he had to show his country
G32 1260  9    and the world would never be seen except by visitors
G32 1270  3    to Taliesin. And now there was some question as to
G32 1280  1    his continued residence there. Billy Koch, who had
G32 1280  9    once worked for Wright as a chauffeur, gave a deposition
G32 1290  8    for Miriam's use that he had seen Olgivanna living
G32 1300  5    at Taliesin. This might put Wright in such a bad light
G32 1310  4    before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin;
G32 1320  1    nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing
G32 1320 11    out that if he was not "compelled to spend money on
G32 1330  8    useless lawyer's bills, useless hotel bills, and useless
G32 1340  5    doctor's bills", he could more quickly provide Miriam
G32 1350  3    with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris,
G32 1360  1    as she preferred. Miriam sniffed at this, and complained
G32 1360 10    that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters.
G32 1370  9    His reply was, "Everything that has been printed derogatory
G32 1380  6    to you, purporting to have come from me, was a betrayal,
G32 1390  7    and nothing yet has been printed which I have sanctioned".
G32 1400  4    What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told the
G32 1410  2    papers about a reasonable offer he had made, which
G32 1410 11    he considered she would accept "when she tires of publicity".
G32 1420  9    From her California headquarters, Miriam fired back,
G32 1430  5    "I shall never divorce Mr. Wright, to permit him to
G32 1440  6    marry Olga Milanoff".
G32 1440  9       Then Miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare
G32 1450  6    by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance
G32 1460  6    that had been pending, and asking for divorce on the
G32 1470  5    grounds of cruelty, with the understanding that Wright
G32 1480  1    would not contest it. The Bank of Wisconsin sent a
G32 1480 11    representative to the judge's chambers in Madison to
G32 1490  8    give information on Wright's ability to meet the terms.
G32 1500  6    He said that the architect might reasonably be expected
G32 1510  3    to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could
G32 1520  2    be brought to an end, and that the bank would accept
G32 1520 13    a mortgage on Taliesin to help bring this about. Miriam
G32 1530  9    said that she must be assured that "that other woman,
G32 1540  6    Olga, will not be in luxury while I am scraping along".
G32 1550  4    This exhausted Wright's patience, and in consequence
G32 1560  1    he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite.
G32 1560 11    "Volstead laws, speed laws, divorce laws", he said,
G32 1570  8    "as they now stand, demoralize the individual, make
G32 1580  6    liars and law breakers of us in one way or another,
G32 1590  5    and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd.
G32 1600  1    If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning,
G32 1600 11    I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland, to do what I
G32 1610 12    can. I realize, in taking this stand, just what it
G32 1620  8    means to me and mine". Here Wright gave a slight sigh
G32 1630  5    of weariness, and continued, "It means more long years
G32 1640  3    lived across the social grain of the life of our people,
G32 1650  1    making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect
G32 1650 11    and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those
G32 1660  9    dependent upon me". Next day, word came that Miriam
G32 1670  6    was not going through with the divorce; but Wright
G32 1680  3    stayed in the United States. His mentioning of Japan
G32 1680 12    and Holland had been merely the expression of wishful
G32 1690  9    thinking. No matter what troubles might betide him,
G32 1700  6    this most American of artists knew in his heart he
G32 1710  5    could not function properly outside his native land.
G32 1720  1       In a few weeks Miriam made another sortie at Taliesin,
G32 1720 11    but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates.
