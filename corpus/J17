J17 0010  1       Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates
J17 0010  8    depend on individual experience and are aroused in
J17 0020  7    man, in addition, by complex symbols, one would expect
J17 0030  5    that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex.
J17 0040  3    In experiments with topical application of strychnine
J17 0040 10    on the cerebral cortex, the transmission of impulses
J17 0050  8    from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated.
J17 0060  4    Moreover, the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to
J17 0070  3    nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under
J17 0070  9    these conditions. Even more complex and obviously cortically
J17 0080  8    induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited
J17 0090  7    in monkey A on seeing monkey B (but not a rabbit)
J17 0100  7    in emotional stress. A previously extinguished conditioned
J17 0110  3    reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated
J17 0120  1    with typical signs of emotional excitement including
J17 0120  8    sympathetic discharges.
J17 0130  2       It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism
J17 0140  1    exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far
J17 0140 11    as emotional reactivity is concerned, and that the
J17 0150  6    balance between the two systems determines the emotional
J17 0160  3    responsiveness of the organism. In addition, the
J17 0170  1    neocortical-hypothalamic
J17 0170  3    relations play a great role in primates, as Mirsky's
J17 0180  2    interesting experiment on the "communication of affect"
J17 0190  1    demonstrates. But even in relatively primitive laboratory
J17 0190  8    animals such as the rat, sex activity closely identified
J17 0200  9    with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced
J17 0210  7    by the neocortex. MacLean stressed correctly the importance
J17 0220  4    of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual
J17 0230  3    and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the
J17 0240  1    limbic brain (including the hypothalamus) on emotions
J17 0240  8    related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions.
J17 0250  8    It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic
J17 0260  3    interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of
J17 0270  2    emotional processes with those underlying perception,
J17 0270  8    memory, imagination, and creativity.
J17 0280  4       Previous experiences are obviously of great importance
J17 0290  4    for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response.
J17 0300  2    The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known
J17 0300 12    to contribute to memory, but this topic is beyond the
J17 0310  9    scope of this paper.
J17 0320  2    #XIII. HYPOTHALAMIC BALANCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE#
J17 0320  8    After this brief discussion of neo-, paleocortical,
J17 0330  8    and cortico-hypothalamic relations, let us return once
J17 0340  6    more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its
J17 0350  3    physiological and pathological significance. Facilitatory
J17 0360  1    processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus
J17 0360  8    via ascending and descending pathways. Thus cortico-fugal
J17 0370  7    discharges induced by topical application of strychnine
J17 0380  4    to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes
J17 0390  3    present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive
J17 0400  1    discharges. On the other hand, the temporary reduction
J17 0400  9    in hypothalamic excitability through the injection
J17 0410  5    of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes
J17 0420  3    a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical
J17 0430  2    strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability
J17 0430  8    is restored. Apparently, a positive feedback exists
J17 0440  6    between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral
J17 0450  4    cortex. Consequently, if for any reason the hypothalamic
J17 0460  3    excitability falls below the physiological level, the
J17 0470  1    lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a
J17 0470  8    diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent
J17 0480  8    reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges. Obviously,
J17 0490  3    a vicious cycle develops. This tendency can be broken
J17 0500  3    either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly
J17 0500  9    or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways. It is believed
J17 0510  8    that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former
J17 0520  6    and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.
J17 0530  1       Before we comment further on these pathological
J17 0530  8    conditions, we should remember that changes in the
J17 0540  8    state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits
J17 0550  3    distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Thus, a low intensity
J17 0560  4    of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep
J17 0570  1    and a high one during wakefulness, resulting in synchronous
J17 0570 10    EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the
J17 0580  9    latter condition. Moreover, the dominance in parasympathetic
J17 0590  5    action (with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic)
J17 0600  4    at the hypothalamic level induces, by its peripheral
J17 0610  1    action, the autonomic symptoms of sleep and, by its
J17 0610 10    action on the cortex, a lessening in the reactivity
J17 0620  7    of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous
J17 0630  5    system. With the dominance of the sympathetic division
J17 0640  2    of the hypothalamus, the opposite changes occur. Since
J17 0650  1    electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus
J17 0650  7    produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation
J17 0660  5    of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep, it may
J17 0670  4    be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is
J17 0680  1    altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of
J17 0680 10    the hypothalamus. Similar effects can be induced reflexly
J17 0690  7    via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals.
J17 0700  5       Of particular importance is the study of the actions
J17 0710  3    of drugs in this respect. Although no drugs act exclusively
J17 0720  1    on the hypothalamus or a part of it, there is sufficient
J17 0720 12    specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic
J17 0730  8    balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce
J17 0740  6    a parasympathetic dominance. The former comprise analeptic
J17 0750  4    and psychoactive drugs, the latter the tranquilizers.
J17 0760  1    Specific differences exist in the action of different
J17 0760  9    drugs belonging to the same group as, for instance,
J17 0770  9    between reserpine and chlorpromazine. Important as
J17 0780  4    these differences are, they should not obscure the
J17 0790  3    basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance
J17 0790 11    sufficiently to the parasympathetic side, we produce
J17 0800  7    depressions, whereas a shift in the opposite direction
J17 0810  7    causes excitatory effects and, eventually, maniclike
J17 0820  2    changes. The emotional states produced by drugs influence
J17 0830  1    the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner;
J17 0830  8    synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental
J17 0840  8    animal after administration of tranquilizers, but asynchrony
J17 0850  5    after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs.
J17 0860  3       The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic
J17 0870  2    balance. Physiological experiments and clinical observations
J17 0880  1    have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically
J17 0880  9    controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic
J17 0890  6    discharges. They shift the hypothalamic balance to
J17 0900  7    the sympathetic side. This explains the beneficial
J17 0910  3    effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions
J17 0920  1    and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity
J17 0920 13    of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl
J17 0930  8    test. Some investigators have found a parallelism between
J17 0940  6    remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity
J17 0950  2    of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated
J17 0960  1    by the Mecholyl test and, conversely, between clinical
J17 0960  9    impairment and increasing deviation of this test from
J17 0970  7    the norm. Nevertheless, the theory that the determining
J17 0980  5    influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound
J17 0990  3    influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric
J17 0990 10    patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number
J17 1000 10    of patients. The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied
J17 1010  6    with certain precautions are reliable indicators of
J17 1020  4    this central autonomic balance, but for the sake of
J17 1030  2    correlating autonomic and clinical states, and of studying
J17 1030 10    the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central
J17 1040  7    autonomic reactions, additional tests seem to be desirable.
J17 1050  7       It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic
J17 1060  5    balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric
J17 1070  1    patients from the application of certain therapeutic
J17 1070  8    procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness
J17 1080  9    cycle. A change in the balance to the parasympathetic
J17 1090  9    side leads in the normal individual to sleep or, in
J17 1100  6    special circumstances, to cardiovascular collapse or
J17 1110  3    nausea and vomiting. In both conditions the emotional
J17 1110 11    and perceptual sensitivity is diminished, but no depression
J17 1120  8    occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced
J17 1130  9    in normal persons by drugs. The fundamental differences
J17 1140  3    between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic
J17 1150  3    (and also of sympathetic) dominance remain to be elucidated.
J17 1160  2       Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies
J17 1170  1    in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic
J17 1170 11    discharges which are associated with changes in its
J17 1180  8    balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity.
J17 1190  4    A state of parasympathetic "tuning" of the hypothalamus
J17 1200  4    induced experimentally causes not only an increase
J17 1210  1    in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure
J17 1210  8    to direct and reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also
J17 1220  7    to an autonomic reversal: a stimulus acting sympathetically
J17 1230  5    under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning
J17 1240  5    a parasympathetic response! Furthermore, conditioned
J17 1250  1    reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic
J17 1250  8    sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical
J17 1260  7    level, and several types of behavioral changes probably
J17 1270  5    related to the degree of central autonomic "tuning"
J17 1280  2    are observed. If, for instance, such a change is produced
J17 1290  2    by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks, previously
J17 1300  1    inhibited conditioned reactions reappear. However,
J17 1300  6    if these procedures are applied more often, conditioned
J17 1310  6    emotional responses are temporarily abolished. In other
J17 1320  4    studies, loss of differentiation in previously established
J17 1330  2    conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive
J17 1330  8    (metrazol) treatments, suggesting a fundamental disturbance
J17 1340  6    in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral
J17 1350  6    processes.
J17 1350  7       It has further been shown that: (1) an experimental
J17 1360  8    neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a
J17 1370  6    reversible shift in the central autonomic balance;
J17 1380  2    (2) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned
J17 1390  1    reactions; (3) in a state of depression, the positive
J17 1390 10    conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned
J17 1400  8    reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of
J17 1410  4    the excitatory desynchronizing (alerting) effect on
J17 1420  3    the EEG. These are few and seemingly disjointed data,
J17 1430  1    but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental
J17 1430  9    alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety
J17 1440  8    of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been
J17 1450  4    altered by physiological experimentation, pharmacological
J17 1460  2    action, or clinical processes.
J17 1460  6    #XIV. ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF SOME FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY#
J17 1470  7    The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance
J17 1490  5    plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological
J17 1500  3    and pathological forms of emotion. If this is the case,
J17 1510  3    one would expect that not only the various procedures
J17 1510 12    just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance
J17 1520  7    would influence emotional state and behavior but that
J17 1530  6    emotion itself would act likewise. We pointed out that
J17 1540  4    emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders
J17 1550  1    and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types
J17 1550  8    of personality, but it is also known that the reliving
J17 1560  9    of a strong emotion ("abreaction") may cure a battle
J17 1570  5    neurosis. This phenomenon raises the question whether
J17 1580  2    the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may
J17 1580 11    not have an even wider application in the area of the
J17 1590 11    neuroses. Being a strictly physiological procedure,
J17 1600  3    one may expect from such a study additional information
J17 1610  2    on the nature of the emotional process itself.
J17 1620  1       Wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in
J17 1620  8    this area. He showed convincingly that anxiety is a
J17 1630  6    learned (conditioned) reaction and is the basis of
J17 1640  5    experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed, therefore,
J17 1650  1    that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses
J17 1650  9    are functional and reversible. An important observation
J17 1660  6    of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a
J17 1670  7    reversibility by physiological means. In a conditioning
J17 1680  3    experiment, he demonstrated the antagonism between
J17 1680  9    feeding and pain. A mild electrical shock served as
J17 1690  9    a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding.
J17 1700  6    The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited
J17 1710  3    salivary secretion (conditioned reflex). Even when
J17 1710  9    the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually,
J17 1720  8    it failed to evoke any signs of pain. Since strong
J17 1730  7    nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis
J17 1740  2    during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental
J17 1750  1    situation, Wolpe thought that he could utilize the
J17 1750  9    feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms
J17 1760  6    through feeding. Appropriate experiments showed that
J17 1770  4    this is, indeed, possible. He then applied this principle
J17 1790  2    of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses. He took
J17 1790 10    advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness
J17 1800  7    and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance
J17 1810  7    of anxiety when the former attitude was established.
J17 1820  4       For the interpretation of these significant investigations,
J17 1830  2    it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist
J17 1840  2    in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic
J17 1840 11    functions which are closely associated with the emotions.
J17 1850  8    The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this
J17 1860  8    reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic
J17 1870  5    systems. Furthermore, a functional antagonism exists
J17 1880  2    between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety.
J17 1880 11    Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are
J17 1890  7    present, different autonomic-somatic patterns underlie
J17 1900  3    aggression and anxiety, respectively, as indicated
J17 1910  3    by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines,
J17 1910 12    the state of the muscle tone, and the Mecholyl test.
J17 1920  9    The psychological incompatibility of these emotional
J17 1930  4    states seems to be reflected in, or based on, this
J17 1940  3    marked difference.
J17 1940  5    #XV. CONCLUDING REMARKS#
J17 1940  8    In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological
J17 1950 10    and pathological range, we emphasized the importance
J17 1960  6    of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and
J17 1970  5    sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and
J17 1980  2    their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems,
J17 1980 10    respectively. We stressed the reciprocal relation of
J17 1990  7    these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic
J17 2000  6    downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical
J17 2010  4    discharge. Although we are still far from a complete
J17 2020  3    understanding of these problems, as a first approximation,
J17 2030  1    it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic
J17 2030  9    balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical
J17 2040  6    discharges account for major changes in behavior seen
J17 2050  6    in various moods and states of emotions in man and
J17 2060  4    beast under physiological circumstances, in experimental
J17 2060 10    and clinical neurosis, and as the result of psychopharmacological
J17 2070  9    agents. In view of the important role which emotional
J17 2080  9    disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic
J17 2090  7    disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic
J17 2100  4    states and psychological behavior in several instances,
J17 2110  2    it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance
J17 2110 10    may play an important role in initiating mental changes.
