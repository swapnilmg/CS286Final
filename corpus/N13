N13 0010  1       Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin
N13 0010 10    and the Burnsides' glowering faces. "Honey", he whispered.
N13 0020  6    "Soon as we send them on their way and make camp, let's
N13 0030 10    you and me go for a walk down by the Snake- all by
N13 0040  7    ourselves".
N13 0040  8       "Sally", admonished her mother, "you've got all
N13 0050  6    evening to visit with Dan. His wounds need dressing
N13 0060  4    now".
N13 0060  5       Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of
N13 0070  6    fitness for courting. What a spectacle he was, caked
N13 0080  2    with dirt and sweat and blood, filthy as a pig and
N13 0080 13    naked as an Indian, kissing the finest, the sweetest,
N13 0090  7    the bravest, and absolutely the prettiest girl in this
N13 0100  6    whole wonderful world. He released her reluctantly
N13 0110  1    for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap. "Got a lot
N13 0120  1    to tend to, but I'll get back quick as I can", he assured
N13 0120 14    her.
N13 0130  1       Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson
N13 0130  9    summing up their final reckoning for rental on the
N13 0140  8    oxen. Jackson was doing most of the talking. So long
N13 0150  6    as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle, Dan
N13 0160  3    didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth.
N13 0170  1       Soon as the Burnsides moved on, he'd lead Rex down
N13 0170 11    by the river; there he could shave and scrub himself
N13 0180  9    up for the evening. Damn it, he thought bitterly, picking
N13 0190  6    up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in
N13 0200  4    the sleeve. If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did,
N13 0210  3    my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!
N13 0210 11       He stooped, picked up his ruined hat, and pursed
N13 0220  8    his lips thoughtfully. From the way the wound in his
N13 0230  6    head was itching, Dan knew that it would heal. But
N13 0240  2    his only hat was something else again. "Nate! Nate"!
N13 0250  8    he shouted.
N13 0260  1       The Burnsides, now ready to roll, were purposefully
N13 0260  9    deaf to his cry.
N13 0270  2       "Nate"! he bellowed to the retreating back directly
N13 0280  1    in front of him.
N13 0280  5       "I ain't going to fight you no more". Nate turned
N13 0290  3    his head, attempting to speak in a soothing voice.
N13 0300  1       "I know you ain't"! Dan affirmed, feeling ten feet
N13 0300 10    tall. He moved in close, jerked the handsome, broad-brimmed
N13 0310 10    beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own.
N13 0320  9    "Here's a present for you", he said, shoving his bullet-riddled
N13 0330  8    hat down over Nate's purpling forehead. "Me and you's
N13 0340  5    trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to
N13 0350  4    remember me by"!
N13 0350  7       Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan. Slipping
N13 0360  6    her hand in his, they silently watched the Burnsides
N13 0370  3    make the bend in the road and disappear from sight.
N13 0380  1    Much as they had to look forward to, they didn't begrudge
N13 0380 12    a moment of the time they spent seeing them go.
N13 0390  9    #40.#
N13 0390 10    AT FIRST Matilda could not believe her own eyes. She
N13 0400  8    had spent too many hours looking ahead, hoping and
N13 0410  4    longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding
N13 0420  1    nothing but emptiness. And now she could see him, looking
N13 0420 11    uncommon handsome, standing there beside Sally Jackson
N13 0430  7    and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon.
N13 0440  6       Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant
N13 0450  4    Rock was so overwhelming that, for a good minute after
N13 0460  2    they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading
N13 0460 12    toward them, Matilda could not speak at all. Then,
N13 0470  9    with a glory that almost wiped out the deep, downward
N13 0480  6    sags in her careworn face, Matilda leaned over the
N13 0490  3    wheel and shouted to Hez, who was stumbling along in
N13 0490 13    the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon
N13 0500 12    "Pa! Pa! I can see Dan. And he's with the Jacksons"!
N13 0510 10       "What about Burnsides"? Hez asked, who still believed
N13 0520  8    they'd have them to lick.
N13 0530  3       "They ain't even in sight"! she replied.
N13 0540  1       By then Hez could see for himself, and so could
N13 0540 11    the others. Soon they were all shouting greetings,
N13 0550  7    exchanging smiles, and rejoicing to think that they
N13 0560  5    were all back together again. But even a reunion as
N13 0570  2    joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines
N13 0570 14    of the day. Nor could they stop and find out about
N13 0580  9    all that had happened until they made circle, tended
N13 0590  5    the cattle, tethered the horses, gathered fuel, carried
N13 0600  2    water, and started their cooking fires. Then, and only
N13 0600 11    then, with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests
N13 0610 10    of honor, did the Harrows take time to catch up on
N13 0620  8    the news. No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than
N13 0630  5    both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action. The
N13 0640  2    wound in his scalp was examined, pronounced healing,
N13 0640 10    and well doctored with simples, before they dished
N13 0650  7    up the victuals. From then on, in keeping with the
N13 0660  6    traditions they had followed since childhood, the whole
N13 0670  3    group settled down to relish their food. Even Sally,
N13 0670 12    in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome, followed
N13 0680  9    the old taboo of "quitting the gab when wearing the
N13 0690  6    nosebag".
N13 0690  7       After their supper, the evening turned into a regular
N13 0700  7    "Hoe-Down". Only, they carefully substituted old country
N13 0710  4    folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances
N13 0720  3    that were so popular among more worldly trains in the
N13 0730  1    great westward migration. But with Bill O'Connor on
N13 0730  9    the fiddle, and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting "Glory
N13 0740  7    Be" and "Hallelujah" above their united chant of the
N13 0750  7    lilting old ballads, they played their quaint folk
N13 0760  4    games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration.
N13 0770  2       "Golly", Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully
N13 0780  1    stood by her side among the ringed spectators, "don't
N13 0780 10    that fiddle make you wish the Bible didn't say us Baptists
N13 0790 11    can't dance"?
N13 0800  1       "Nor Methodists, neither", she replied. "Not that
N13 0810  1    it matters to me, being this far along".
N13 0810  9       Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he
N13 0820  7    replied. "Come spring, you'll be kicking up your heels
N13 0830  5    and feeling coltish again too, gal".
N13 0840  1       At these words of sympathy and understanding, Harmony
N13 0840  9    said generously, "I don't mind setting here along with
N13 0850  8    Gran while you go out and join in the games".
N13 0860  5       Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group
N13 0870  2    out in the circle long enough to reply, "I ain't much
N13 0880  1    of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell, but
N13 0880 13    I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles".
N13 0890 10    He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his
N13 0900  7    long fingers. "Don't reckon there's nobody out there,
N13 0910  4    'cept maybe Dan, who can outgrip me, Harmony".
N13 0920  1       With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs.
N13 0930  1    Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the
N13 0930 10    face of the cliff, Harmony settled on the edge of the
N13 0940  8    grub box, to ease the pressure of her swollen body
N13 0950  5    on her bone-weary legs, and worried about all that
N13 0960  1    might have happened to Sally. And she was deeply thankful
N13 0960 11    that she could see her now, out there in the midst
N13 0970 10    of a gay, youthful circle, skipping and singing, "Farmer
N13 0980  5    in the dell, Farmer in the dell, Heigh-ho the dairy-oh,
N13 0990  4    the farmer in the dell".
N13 0990  9       At the sight of Sally's happy face and carefree
N13 1000  7    expression, Harmony's dark, brooding eyes quickly brightened
N13 1010  4    with unshed tears. She was glad, completely and unselfishly
N13 1020  3    glad, to see that things were working out the right
N13 1030  1    way for both Sally and Dan. ... And she really tried
N13 1030 12    to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just
N13 1040  9    as right as they now were for her and for Rod. But
N13 1050  7    she couldn't, not yet. Not with the memory of her folks
N13 1060  4    and the lost Conestoga still holding her close ...
N13 1070  1       Out in the center of the circle the farmer, who
N13 1070 11    was Dan, wasted no time when they came to the line,
N13 1080  9    "The farmer choose his wife". With a swift swoop of
N13 1090  6    his big arms, he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding
N13 1100  3    him, and then kissed her soundly before setting her
N13 1110  1    down so she could stand by his side while they jointly
N13 1110 12    chose the rest of their "outfit". Soon the child, the
N13 1120  8    dog, the cat ... and even the cheese, all joined them
N13 1130  6    out there in the circle.
N13 1130 11       By now Harmony could see that most of the adults
N13 1140  9    in the train were winded and resting, or else siphoned
N13 1150  5    off from the games by the challenging lure of the great
N13 1160  4    cliff towering above them. No matter how many registry
N13 1170  1    rocks they came to on this journey, each one exerted
N13 1170 11    its own appeal. Even strange names seemed to make them
N13 1180  8    feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled
N13 1190  3    across out here in this wilderness. Already a few hardy
N13 1200  4    folk from their own train were zealously chipping away
N13 1200 13    at the register rocks, leaving their own records along
N13 1210  9    with those made by the earlier trains. Soon she saw
N13 1220  7    Rod and Hez moving over to join them.
N13 1230  1       No sooner were they through and the guards posted,
N13 1230 10    than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound
N13 1240 10    sleep. For Matilda, it was the first she had known
N13 1250  7    in many a night. Even the knowledge that she was losing
N13 1260  4    another boy, as a mother always does when a marriage
N13 1260 14    is made, did not prevent her from having the first
N13 1270 10    carefree, dreamless sleep that she had known since
N13 1280  6    they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley,
N13 1290  2    way, way back there when they were crossing those other
N13 1290 12    mountains.
N13 1300  1    ##
N13 1300  2    Next morning, they moved on again.
N13 1300  8       "My souls' a-gracious"! Gran Harrow exclaimed, watching
N13 1310  7    their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up
N13 1320  9    into the load. "A body would swear I floated right
N13 1330  5    up here on a cloud"!
N13 1330 10       Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of
N13 1340  8    her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins.
N13 1350  3    "Shucks, Gran", they said almost in unison. "That wasn't
N13 1360  2    nothing at all"!
N13 1360  5       Leaning forward in her chair, Gran nearsightedly
N13 1370  3    scrutinized Dan's face. "How's Sally like rubbin' agin
N13 1380  4    that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising"?
N13 1390  1       "Quit ragging him, Gran", Rod protested.
N13 1390  7       "I ain't ragging him"! Gran peered again at the
N13 1400  9    week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip.
N13 1410  6    "But honest-to-Betsy, I've seed more hair than that
N13 1420  6    on a piece o' bacon".
N13 1420 11       The two tall brothers waited silently while their
N13 1430  6    mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug, placed
N13 1440  6    the chamber pot beside her feet, and returned to her
N13 1450  3    place at the front of the wagon with Alice.
N13 1450 12       "Rheumatics worse, Pa"? Dan asked Hez, who had limped
N13 1460  9    back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair
N13 1470  8    braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate
N13 1480  4    and tied it tight at the ends.
N13 1480 11       "My right leg's stiff as a board this morning",
N13 1490  8    he replied. "But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we
N13 1500  7    git to rolling".
N13 1500 10       The three men stepped out to the side to wait for
N13 1510 10    Captain Clemens' signal.
N13 1520  1       Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock,
N13 1520 11    official signboard for the Raft River turnoff, and
N13 1530  7    gloated, "Seems funny that them Burnsides never took
N13 1540  5    time to leave their John-Henry up thar".
N13 1550  1       "Wonder what made them hurry so", Rod drawled, giving
N13 1560  1    Dan a sly wink.
N13 1560  5       Dan grinned, and changed the subject. "From now
N13 1570  2    on, Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our
N13 1570 14    turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's
N13 1580 10    outfit".
N13 1580 11       "Ain't no sense you eating our dust", Rod protested.
N13 1590  9       "Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of
N13 1600 11    Harmony being so far along", Dan explained. "Jackson
N13 1610  4    recruited his critters, and him and me fixed up his
N13 1620  5    wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up. He's
N13 1630  1    got the tightest running gear in the train now. Besides,
N13 1630 11    'tain't no more'n right for me to follow with my black
N13 1640 11    oxen, so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either
N13 1650  8    of you get in a pinch".
N13 1660  1       Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying
N13 1660  8    to their waiting teams.
N13 1670  2       "Reckon ye're right, Dan", Hez called back over
N13 1680  1    his shoulder. "I'll shore be needing ye both on the
N13 1680 11    pull out o' the canyon".
N13 1690  3       Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing,
N13 1700  1    precipice-walled gorge. "We'll double teams zigzagging
N13 1700  8    up the mountain, Harmony", he spoke reassuringly, concerned
N13 1710  7    by the pinched look around her mouth. "Like enough
N13 1720  7    we'll all be up on top by sundown".
N13 1730  2       Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his father's
N13 1740  1    wheels beginning to turn.
N13 1740  5       Before Harmony had a chance to reply, Rod cracked
N13 1750  5    his long whip over his thin oxen's backs ...
