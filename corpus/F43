F43 0010  1    Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until
F43 0010 10    the early fifties.
F43 0020  1       Movement itself was the chief and often the only
F43 0020 10    attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties.
F43 0030  8    Each film consisted of fifty feet, which gives a running
F43 0040  6    time of about one minute on the screen. As long as
F43 0050  4    audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little
F43 0050 13    reason to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions
F43 0060  7    took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that
F43 0070  7    of the penny arcade which can still be found in such
F43 0080  6    urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of actual
F43 0090  2    events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes.
F43 0090  9    The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity:
F43 0100  5    a train rushes straight at the audience, or a great
F43 0110  6    wave threatens to break over the seats. An early Edison
F43 0120  3    production was The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.
F43 0130  1    The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman
F43 0130  9    swung his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An
F43 0140 11    early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park
F43 0150  9    simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of
F43 0160  6    the contemporary stage.
F43 0160  9       In the field of entertainment there is no spur to
F43 0170  8    financial daring so effective as audience boredom,
F43 0180  4    and the first decade of the new device was not over
F43 0190  1    before audiences began staying away in large numbers
F43 0190  9    from the simple-minded, one-minute shows. In response,
F43 0200  6    the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture
F43 0210  5    as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential
F43 0220  3    form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer beauty
F43 0230  2    and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films,
F43 0230  9    and travelogues, despite the impressive financial success
F43 0240  6    of such a recent development as Cinerama, the movies
F43 0250  5    are at heart a form of fiction, like the play, the
F43 0260  3    novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically
F43 0270  1    successful of the nonfiction films have invariably
F43 0270  8    borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature.
F43 0280  6    Thus such great American documentaries as The River
F43 0290  4    and The Plow That Broke the Plains were composed as
F43 0300  4    visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.
F43 0310  1    The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was
F43 0310 11    made in the early years of this century and it was
F43 0320  8    made chiefly by two men, a French magician, Georges
F43 0330  3    Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin S.
F43 0340  2    Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known,
F43 0340 12    for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction
F43 0350 10    for films to take the first step toward fashioning
F43 0360  5    a language of film, toward making the motion picture
F43 0370  2    the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained
F43 0380  1    since, even in the most inept hands.
F43 0380  8    #NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME#
F43 0390  1    Melies, however, out of his professional instincts
F43 0390  8    as a magician, discovered and made use of a number
F43 0400  8    of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary
F43 0410  5    of film. One of these is the "dissolve", which makes
F43 0420  3    possible a visually smooth transition from scene to
F43 0420 11    scene. As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding
F43 0430 10    scene begins to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes
F43 0440 10    are present simultaneously, one growing weaker, one
F43 0450  5    growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales and fantasies,
F43 0460  3    Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped
F43 0470  1    to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle
F43 0470  9    and end, complications, resolutions, climaxes, and
F43 0480  4    conclusions. Immediately, the film improved and it
F43 0490  5    improved because in narrative it found a content based
F43 0500  2    on time to complement its own unbreakable connection
F43 0500 10    with time. Physically, a movie is possible because
F43 0510  7    a series of images is projected one at a time at such
F43 0520  7    a speed that the eye "remembers" the one that has gone
F43 0530  4    before even as it registers the one now appearing.
F43 0530 13    Linking the smoothly changing images together, the
F43 0540  7    eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement.
F43 0550  6    The "projection" time of painting and sculpture is
F43 0560  4    highly subjective, varying from person to person and
F43 0570  1    even varying for a given person on different occasions.
F43 0570 10    So is the time of the novel. The drama in the theater
F43 0580  9    and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time,
F43 0590  6    but the time is fixed by the director and the players,
F43 0600  2    the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore,
F43 0610  1    to much variation, as record collectors well know.
F43 0610  9    The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely.
F43 0620  5    The film consists of a series of still, transparent
F43 0630  2    photographs, or "frames", 35-mm.-wide. Each frame comes
F43 0640  2    between the light and the lens and is individually
F43 0640 11    projected on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies,
F43 0650 10    of 16 frames per second, and, for sound films, 24 frames
F43 0660  7    per second. This is the rate of projection; it is also
F43 0670  4    the rate of photographing. Time is built into the motion
F43 0680  3    picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time
F43 0680 11    is also the concern of the fictional narrative, which
F43 0690  8    is, at its simplest, the story of an action with, usually,
F43 0700  8    a beginning, a middle, and an end- elements which demand
F43 0710  6    time as the first condition for their existence. The
F43 0720  2    "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at
F43 0720 12    the audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still
F43 0730 11    picture of the same subject, but the difference is
F43 0740  6    really one of degree; the cinematic element of time
F43 0750  4    is merely used to increase the realism of an object
F43 0750 14    which would still be reasonably realistic in a still
F43 0760  9    photo. In narrative, time is essential, as it is in
F43 0770  8    film. Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly
F43 0780  5    of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained
F43 0790  3    between narrative time and film time. This discovery
F43 0800  1    of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes
F43 0800 10    dazzling, magician's tricks produced on film.
F43 0810  6       It was Porter, however, who produced the very first
F43 0820  6    movie whose name has lived on through the half century
F43 0830  3    of film history that has since ensued. The movie was
F43 0830 13    The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young
F43 0840 10    industry and art were all but incalculable. Overnight,
F43 0850  7    for one thing, Porter's film multiplied the standard
F43 0860  5    running time of movies by ten. The Great Train Robbery
F43 0870  4    is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to twelve
F43 0880  2    minutes- became the standard length from the year of
F43 0880 11    Robbery, 1903, until Griffith shattered that limit
F43 0890  7    forever with Birth of a Nation in 1915. The reel itself
F43 0900  8    became and still is the standard of measure for the
F43 0910  5    movies.
F43 0910  6       The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself;
F43 0920  4    much of it has continued to be used over the years
F43 0930  2    and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the
F43 0930 14    old West- pretty well dominated television toward the
F43 0940  9    end of the 1950's. A band of robbers enters a railroad
F43 0950  7    station, overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator,
F43 0960  3    holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed and
F43 0970  2    pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape,
F43 0970 10    are whooping it up with some wild, wild women in a
F43 0980 10    honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers run from the hide-out,
F43 0990  6    take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot dead
F43 1000  2    by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of
F43 1000 14    one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver
F43 1010  8    straight at the audience.
F43 1020  1       All this is simple enough, but in telling the story
F43 1020 11    Porter did two important things that had not been done
F43 1030  9    before. Each scene is shot straight through, as had
F43 1040  5    been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a
F43 1050  3    single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially
F43 1050 11    in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's
F43 1060  8    camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera
F43 1070  6    position standard until then, which had been, roughly,
F43 1080  4    that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a
F43 1090  2    play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel
F43 1090 14    with the plane of the film in the camera or on the
F43 1100 11    screen. If the change, at first sight, seems minor,
F43 1110  5    we may recall that it took the Italian painters about
F43 1120  2    two hundred years to make an analogous change, and
F43 1120 11    the Italian painters, by universal consent, were the
F43 1130  7    most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen.
F43 1140  6    In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way
F43 1150  4    to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument
F43 1150 14    of art as well as a mechanical recording device.
F43 1160  9       He did more than that. He revealed the potential
F43 1170  6    value of the "cut" as the basic technique in the art
F43 1180  5    of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically
F43 1190  1    in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word
F43 1190 12    is quite physical, to begin with. The physical film
F43 1200  8    is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence,
F43 1210  6    and the cut edge is joined physically, by cement, to
F43 1220  4    the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.
F43 1220 14    If, as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable
F43 1230 10    footage of your child taking its first steps, you have
F43 1240  7    merely recorded an historical event. If, in preparing
F43 1250  4    that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends,
F43 1260  1    you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames
F43 1260 11    of the child's grandmother watching this event, you
F43 1270  6    have begun to be an artist in film; you are employing
F43 1280  5    the basic technique of film; you are cutting.
F43 1290  1       This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the
F43 1290 11    looted train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station,
F43 1300 10    where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with
F43 1310  5    her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on
F43 1320  6    the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two events
F43 1330  2    are taking place at the same time. Time and space have
F43 1330 13    both become cinematic. We leap from event to event-
F43 1340  8    including the formation of the posse- even though the
F43 1350  7    events, in "reality" are taking place not in sequence
F43 1360  5    but simultaneously, and not near each other but at
F43 1370  2    a considerable distance.
F43 1370  5       The "chase" as a standard film device probably dates
F43 1380  4    from The Great Train Robbery, and there is a reason
F43 1390  4    for the continued popularity of the device. The chase
F43 1390 13    in itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and
F43 1400 10    urgency and it demands cutting- both from pursued to
F43 1410  5    pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both.
F43 1420  6    The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another is
F43 1430  2    of its nature better fitted for the film than it is
F43 1430 13    for any other form of fiction. The cowboy films, the
F43 1440  8    cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films
F43 1450  5    culminating in an insane chase are not only catering
F43 1460  3    to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for
F43 1460 14    violence; these films and these sequences are also
F43 1470  8    seeking out- instinctively or by design- the peculiarly
F43 1480  6    cinematic elements of narrative.
F43 1490  1    #THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D.W.GRIFFITH#
F43 1490 10    There still remained the need for one great film artist
F43 1500 10    to explore the full potential of the new form and to
F43 1510  8    make it an art. The man was D.W. Griffith. When he
F43 1520  4    came to the movies- more or less by accident- they
F43 1530  4    were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling
F43 1530 11    the unthinking for an idle few minutes. In about seven
F43 1540  9    years Griffith either invented or first realized the
F43 1550  6    possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal
F43 1560  4    of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith had
F43 1570  2    created the art of the film.
F43 1570  8       Not that there had not been attempts, mostly European,
F43 1580  4    to do exactly that. But in general the European efforts
F43 1590  2    to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the
F43 1590 12    slowly emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly
F43 1600  8    condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays
F43 1610  7    were presented. Great actors and actresses- the most
F43 1620  5    notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired to repeat
F43 1630  3    their stage performances before the camera. In all
F43 1630 11    of this extensive and expensive effort, the camera
F43 1640  7    was downgraded to the status of recording instrument
F43 1650  4    for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by
F43 1660  3    the author. The phonograph today, for all its high
F43 1660 12    fidelity and stereophonic sound, is precisely what
F43 1670  7    the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make
F43 1680  6    of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach did
F43 1690  2    not work. The effort produced a valuable record of
F43 1690 11    stage techniques in the early years of the century
F43 1700  8    and some interesting records of great theater figures
F43 1710  5    who would otherwise be only names. But no art at all
F43 1720  3    was born of the art effort in the early movies.
