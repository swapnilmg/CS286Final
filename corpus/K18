K18 0010  1       She was getting real dramatic. I'd have been more
K18 0010 10    impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played
K18 0030  8    Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course. I
K18 0040  5    didn't want her back on that broken record.
K18 0050  2       "Nothing's free in the whole goddam world", was
K18 0060  1    all I could think of to say. When I'd delivered myself
K18 0060 12    of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another
K18 0070 11    drink.
K18 0070 12       "I am", she said.
K18 0080  4       I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky
K18 0090  1    Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending.
K18 0100  1    It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like
K18 0100 11    we used to in the old days, and me staring at her across
K18 0110 10    the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because
K18 0120  6    I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery
K18 0130  3    but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch. Drunk
K18 0140  1    or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world
K18 0140 12    for me. I was crazy about her all over again. It was
K18 0150  9    the call of the wild all right.
K18 0160  1       That evening turned out to be hell like all the
K18 0160 11    others. We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill.
K18 0170  8    It was the same old routine. Eileen got to dancing,
K18 0180  5    just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that
K18 0190  3    you could hardly notice, and trying to pick up strange
K18 0200  1    men, but each time I was ready to say to hell with
K18 0200 13    it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk
K18 0210  6    so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about
K18 0220  4    the good times and the happiness we'd had together
K18 0230  1    and there I was back on the hook.
K18 0230  9       I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell
K18 0240  6    her I'd met old friends and would be home late.
K18 0250  2       "I could scratch her eyes out", Eileen cried and
K18 0250 11    stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth.
K18 0260 11    "You know I don't like my men to have other women.
K18 0270  9    I hate it. I hate it".
K18 0280  1       She got so drunk I had to take her home. It was
K18 0280 13    a walk up on Hudson Street. She just about made me
K18 0290  8    carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't
K18 0300  7    let me go.
K18 0300 10       There was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw
K18 0310  8    hat on the table. The place smelt of some kind of hair
K18 0320  5    lotion these pimplike characters use. "What about Ballestre"?
K18 0330  2    I had to shake her to make her listen. "Precious. What
K18 0340  2    about him"?
K18 0340  4       Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic. "Precious
K18 0350  2    and I allow each other absolute freedom. We are above
K18 0360  2    being jealous. He's used to me bringing home strange
K18 0360 11    men. I'll just tell him you're my husband. He can't
K18 0370  9    object to that".
K18 0380  1       "Well I object. If he pokes his nose in here I'll
K18 0380 12    slug him".
K18 0390  2       "That really would be funny".
K18 0390  7       She began to laugh. She was still laughing when
K18 0400  8    I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed. After
K18 0410  6    all I'm made of flesh and blood. I'm not a plaster
K18 0420  4    saint.
K18 0420  5       Waking up was horrible. Never in my life have I
K18 0430  3    felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did
K18 0430 13    about spending that night with my own wife.
K18 0440  8       We both had hangovers. Eileen declared she couldn't
K18 0450  5    lift her head from the pillow. She lay under the covers
K18 0460  5    making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling
K18 0470  1    me where to look for the coffeepot. I was stumbling
K18 0470 11    in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn
K18 0480  9    kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic
K18 0490  4    smell. There was somebody else in the apartment.
K18 0500  1       I stiffened. Honest I could feel the hair stand
K18 0500 10    up on the back of my neck like a dog's that is going
K18 0510 11    to get into a fight. I turned around with the percolator
K18 0520  6    in my hand. My eyes were so bleary I could barely see
K18 0530  5    him but there he was, a little smooth olivefaced guy
K18 0540  2    in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora.
K18 0540 11    Brown eyes, eyebrow mustache. Oval face without an
K18 0550  7    expression in the world.
K18 0560  1       We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice
K18 0560 10    was screeching at us from the bed. "Joseph Maria Ballestre
K18 0570  9    meet Francis Xavier Bowman. Exboyfriend meet exhusband".
K18 0580  5    She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard. "And don't
K18 0590  6    either of you forget that I'm not any man's property.
K18 0600  4    If you want to fight, go down on the sidewalk". She
K18 0610  2    was enjoying the situation. Imagine that.
K18 0610  8       Eileen was a psychologist all right. Instead of
K18 0620  8    wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having
K18 0630  5    a fellowfeeling for him. Maybe he felt the same way.
K18 0640  3    I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life. First
K18 0640 14    thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the
K18 0650 11    breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and
K18 0660  6    she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers.
K18 0670  5       I couldn't face Thelma after that night. I didn't
K18 0680  4    even have the nerve to call her on the telephone. I
K18 0690  2    wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old
K18 0690 13    bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my
K18 0700  9    clothes down by express. Of course I had to give her
K18 0710  7    Eileen's address, but she never came near us. All she
K18 0720  4    did was write me a pleasant little note about how it
K18 0720 15    was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had
K18 0730 10    parted our ways and it was goodbye forever. She never
K18 0740  7    said a word about the fifty dollars. She added a postscript
K18 0750  5    begging me to be careful about drinking. I must know
K18 0760  3    that that was my greatest weakness underlined three
K18 0760 11    times.
K18 0770  1       Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma
K18 0770  9    on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma
K18 0780  8    trying to take her husband away. That finished me with
K18 0790  6    Thelma. Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of
K18 0800  4    a situation.
K18 0800  6       And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy
K18 0810  4    fourth floor attic on Hudson Street. I use the phrase
K18 0820  2    advisedly because there was something positively indecent
K18 0820  9    about our relationship. I felt it and it ate on me
K18 0830 11    all the time, but I didn't know how right I was till
K18 0840  8    later.
K18 0840  9       What I did know was that Precious was always around.
K18 0850  6    He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs.
K18 0860  5    "Who do you think pays the rent? You wouldn't have
K18 0870  2    me throw the poor boy out on the street", Eileen said
K18 0870 13    when I needled her about it. I said sure that was what
K18 0880 12    I wanted her to do but she paid no attention. Eileen
K18 0890  9    had a wonderful way of not listening to things she
K18 0900  4    didn't want to hear. Still I didn't think she was twotiming
K18 0910  4    me with Precious right then. To be on the safe side
K18 0920  1    I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night.
K18 0920 13       Precious had me worried. I couldn't make out what
K18 0930  9    his racket was. I'd thought him a pimp or procurer
K18 0940  7    but he didn't seem to be. He was smooth and civil spoken
K18 0950  4    but it seemed to me there was something tough under
K18 0970  1    his selfeffacing manner. Still he let Eileen treat
K18 0970  9    him like a valet. Whenever the place was cleaned or
K18 0980  7    a meal served it was Precious who did the work.
K18 0990  5       I never could find out what his business was. He
K18 1000  2    always seemed to have money in his pocket. The phone
K18 1000 12    had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and
K18 1010  8    notes by special messenger. Now and then he would disappear
K18 1020  7    for several days. "Connections" was all he would say
K18 1030  6    with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions.
K18 1040  2    "Oh he's just an international spy", Eileen would shout
K18 1050  2    with her screechy laugh.
K18 1050  6       Poor devil he can't have been too happy either.
K18 1060  4    He got no relief from drink because, though sometimes
K18 1070  1    Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with
K18 1070 12    us in the evening, he'd leave it on the table untouched.
K18 1080  9       When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess.
K18 1090  9    Occasionally if I pushed him too far he'd give me a
K18 1100  8    look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull
K18 1110  3    would show through that smooth face of his. "Some day",
K18 1120  1    I told Eileen, "that guy will kill us both". She just
K18 1120 12    wouldn't listen.
K18 1130  2       Getting drunk every night was the only way I could
K18 1140  2    handle the situation. Eileen seemed to feel the same
K18 1140 11    way. We still had that much in common. The trouble
K18 1150  8    was drinking cost money. The way Eileen and I were
K18 1160  6    hitting it up, we needed ten or fifteen dollars an
K18 1170  2    evening. Eileen must have wheedled a little out of
K18 1170 11    Precious. I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes
K18 1180 10    I had left over from my respectable uptown life, but
K18 1190  6    when that was gone I didn't have a cent. I don't know
K18 1200  5    what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't come
K18 1210  2    to town.
K18 1210  4       Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim. He had the
K18 1220  4    same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't
K18 1220 14    have Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm.
K18 1230 10    He was a big thick beefy violent man. Now Pat may have
K18 1240  9    been a lecher and a plugugly, but he was a good churchgoing
K18 1250  7    Catholic and he loved his little sister. Those O'Dwyers
K18 1260  4    had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together
K18 1280  2    in spite of politics and everything.
K18 1280  8       Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell
K18 1290  9    steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how
K18 1300  5    happy he was we had come together again. "Whom God
K18 1310  1    hath joined" etcetera. The O'Dwyers were real religious
K18 1310  9    people except for Kate. Now it would be up to me to
K18 1320 12    keep the little girl out of mischief. Pat had been
K18 1330  7    worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that
K18 1340  5    fashion magazine. It had gone big with the Hollywood
K18 1350  1    girls when he told them his sister was an editor of
K18 1350 12    Art and Apparel. How about me trying to help her get
K18 1360  9    her job back?
K18 1370  1       All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little
K18 1370 10    girl getting ready for her first communion. It just
K18 1380  7    about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly
K18 1390  4    came out with what she came out with. "But brother
K18 1400  1    I can't take a job right now", she said with her eyes
K18 1400 13    on her ice cream, "I'm going to have a baby, Francis
K18 1410 10    Xavier's baby, my own husband's baby".
K18 1420  5       My first thought was how had it happened so soon,
K18 1430  4    but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd
K18 1440  1    been living together six weeks. Pat meanwhile was bubbling
K18 1440 10    over with sentiment. Greatest thing that ever happened.
K18 1450  7    Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love
K18 1460  8    honor and obey, and she'd have to quit drinking. He'd
K18 1470  4    come East for the christening, by God he would. When
K18 1480  2    we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar
K18 1480 11    bill into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette.
K18 1490  9       Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed
K18 1500 10    up with a job. Pat had contacts all over the labor
K18 1510  5    movement. A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato had
K18 1520  2    just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union.
K18 1520  8       The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small
K18 1530  6    time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as
K18 1540  6    watchmen on the wharves. Most of them were elderly
K18 1550  2    men. It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work
K18 1550 10    because the thieving is awful in the port of New York.
K18 1560 11    They weren't as well paid as they should have been.
K18 1570  8    One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over
K18 1580  5    was to get the protection of his musclemen.
K18 1590  1       Sposato needed a front, some labor stiff with a
K18 1590 10    clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook
K18 1600  8    local. There I was a retired wobbly and structural
K18 1610  4    iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow
K18 1620  1    worker in my thirty years in the movement. For once
K18 1620 11    radicalism was a recommendation.
K18 1630  3       Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired. With my gray
K18 1640  4    hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked
K18 1650  1    the honest working stiff. The things a man will do
K18 1650 11    for a woman.
