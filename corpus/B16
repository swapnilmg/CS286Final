B16 0010  1    #"A LOUSY JOB"#
B16 0010  4    _CHICAGO, AUG. 9_
B16 0010  7       - No doubt there have been moments during every
B16 0020  5    Presidency when the man in the White House has had
B16 0030  3    feelings of frustration, exasperation, exhaustion,
B16 0030  8    and even panic. This we can sympathetically understand.
B16 0040  7    But no President ever before referred to his as a "lousy
B16 0050  8    job" [as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy
B16 0060  4    as doing in conversation with Sen. Barry Goldwater].
B16 0070  3       During his aggressive campaign to win his present
B16 0080  3    position, Mr. Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's
B16 0090  1    "prestige" abroad. What does he think a remark like
B16 0090 10    this "lousy" one does to our prestige and morale?
B16 0100  8       If the President of the United States really feels
B16 0110  7    he won himself a "lousy job", then heaven help us all.

B16 0130  1    _EVANSVILLE, IND., AUG. 5_
B16 0130  4       - Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara has asked
B16 0140  3    Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters
B16 0150  1    costing about 200 million dollars. Why should Congress
B16 0150  9    even consider allowing such a sum for that which can
B16 0160  9    give no protection?
B16 0170  1       Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an
B16 0170 11    atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in
B16 0180  7    a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a
B16 0190  4    long time. The scientists have also warned that no
B16 0190 13    life above ground or underground, sheltered or unsheltered
B16 0200  8    could be expected to survive in an area at least 50
B16 0210  9    miles in diameter.
B16 0210 12       This sum spent for foreign economic aid, the peace
B16 0220  9    corps, food for peace, or any other program to solve
B16 0230  7    the problems of the underdeveloped countries would
B16 0240  2    be an investment that would pay off in world peace,
B16 0240 12    increased world trade, and prosperity for every country
B16 0250  8    on the globe.
B16 0260  1       Let us prepare for peace, instead of for a war which
B16 0260 11    would mean the end of civilization. @
B16 0270  5    #SHORT SHORTS ON THE CAMPUS#
B16 0280  1    _CHICAGO, AUG. 4_
B16 0280  3       - It seems college isn't what it should be. I refer
B16 0280 13    to the attire worn by the students. Upon a visit to
B16 0290 11    a local junior college last week, I was shocked to
B16 0300  7    see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young
B16 0310  4    men wearing Bermuda shorts.
B16 0310  8       Is this what our children are to come face to face
B16 0320  9    with when they are ready for college in a few years?
B16 0330  1    Education should be uppermost in their minds, but with
B16 0340  2    this attire how can anyone think it is so? It looks
B16 0340 13    more like they are going to play at the beach instead
B16 0350 10    of taking lessons on bettering themselves.
B16 0360  2       High school students have more sense of the way
B16 0370  2    to dress than college students. Many high school students
B16 0370 11    go past my house every day, and they look like perfect
B16 0380 10    ladies and gentlemen. No matter how hot the day, they
B16 0390  8    are dressed properly and not in shorts. @
B16 0395  2    #MASARYK AWARD#
B16 0400  1    _CHICAGO, AUG. 9_
B16 0400  4       - The granting of the Jan Masaryk award August 13
B16 0410  7    to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter example of misleading
B16 0420  4    minorities.
B16 0420  5       Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people
B16 0430  6    who killed Masaryk, and against principles Masaryk
B16 0440  2    died to uphold. Douglas has voted for aid to Communists
B16 0440 12    and for the destruction of individual freedom [public
B16 0450  8    housing, foreign aid, etc.]. @
B16 0460  3    #SUBSIDIES FROM CTA#
B16 0470  1    _OAK PARK, AUG. 8_
B16 0470  1       - In today's "Voice", the CTA is urged to reduce
B16 0470 10    fares for senior citizens. Rising costs have increased
B16 0480  8    the difficulties of the elderly, and I would be the
B16 0490  9    last to say they should not receive consideration.
B16 0500  2    But why is it the special responsibility of the CTA
B16 0510  1    to help these people?
B16 0510  5       Why should CTA regular riders subsidize reduced
B16 0520  3    transportation for old people any more than the people
B16 0530  2    who drive their own cars or walk to work should? The
B16 0530 13    welfare of citizens, old and young, is the responsibility
B16 0540  9    of the community, not only of that part of it that
B16 0550  9    rides the CTA. CTA regulars already subsidize transportation
B16 0560  4    for school children, policemen, and firemen. @
B16 0570  4    #MARKETING MEAT#
B16 0570  6    _CHICAGO, AUG. 9_
B16 0570  9       - In reply to a letter in today's "voice" urging
B16 0580  9    the sale of meat after 6 p. m., I wish to state the
B16 0590  9    other side of the story.
B16 0600  1       I am the wife of the owner of a small, independent
B16 0600 11    meat market. My husband's hours away from home for
B16 0610  6    the past years have been from 7 a. m. to 7 p. m. the
B16 0620  7    early part of the week, and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends.
B16 0630  5    Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-
B16 0640  3    and Sundays, too, for this is coming.
B16 0640 10       There is a trend to packaging meat at a central
B16 0650  6    source, freezing it, and shipping it to outlying stores,
B16 0660  2    where meat cutters will not be required. If a customer
B16 0670  1    wishes a special cut, it will not be available. We
B16 0670 11    are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged,
B16 0680  6    whether we want it or not.
B16 0690  1       Most women, in this age of freezers, shop for the
B16 0690 11    entire week on week-ends, when prices are lower. Also,
B16 0700  9    many working wives have children or husbands who take
B16 0710  5    over the shopping chores for them.
B16 0720  1       Independent market owners work six days a week;
B16 0720  9    and my husband hasn't had a vacation in 14 years. No,
B16 0730  8    we are not greedy. But if we closed the store for a
B16 0740  5    vacation, we would lose our customers to the chain
B16 0750  1    stores in the next block.
B16 0750  6       The meat cutters' union, which has a history of
B16 0760  4    being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area,
B16 0770  1    represents the little corner markets as well as the
B16 0770 10    large supermarkets. What it is trying to do is to protect
B16 0780 10    the little man, too, as well as trying to maintain
B16 0790  5    a flow of fresh meat to all stores, with choice of
B16 0800  2    cut being made by the consumer, not the store. @
B16 0800 12    #THE LEGION CONVENTION AND SIDNEY HOLZMAN#
B16 0810  5    _CHICAGO, AUG. 9_
B16 0810  8       - I, too, congratulate the American Legion, of which
B16 0820  7    I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years,
B16 0830  8    on the recent state convention.
B16 0840  1       I regret that Bertha Madeira [today's "Voice"] obtained
B16 0850  1    incorrect information. Had I been granted the floor
B16 0850  9    on a point of personal privilege, the matter she raised
B16 0860  7    would have been clarified.
B16 0870  1       The resolution under discussion at the convention
B16 0870  8    was to require the boards of election to instruct judges
B16 0880  8    to properly display the American flag. Judges under
B16 0890  5    the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners
B16 0900  3    are instructed to do this.
B16 0900  8       The resolution further asked that polling place
B16 0910  6    proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for
B16 0920  5    the display of the flag.
B16 0920 10       It was my desire to advise the membership of the
B16 0930  7    Legion that the majority of polling places are on private
B16 0940  5    property and, without an amendment to the law, we could
B16 0950  3    not enforce this. My discussion with reference to the
B16 0950 12    resolution was that we should commend those citizens
B16 0960  8    who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge
B16 0970  6    their duty and polling place proprietors who make available
B16 0980  4    their private premises, and not by innuendo criticize
B16 0990  2    them. At no time did I attempt to seek approval or
B16 0990 13    commendation for the members of the Chicago board of
B16 1000  9    election commissioners for the discharge of their duties.

B16 1010  8    #TEACHING THE HANDICAPPED#
B16 1020  1    _CHICAGO, AUG. 7_
B16 1020  4       - The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children
B16 1030  2    wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic
B16 1040  1    charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and DePaul
B16 1040  9    university of the establishment of the Institute for
B16 1050  7    Special Education at the university for the training
B16 1060  4    of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally
B16 1070  1    retarded children.
B16 1070  3       In these days of serious shortage of properly trained
B16 1080  4    teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped
B16 1090  1    and mentally handicapped children, the establishment
B16 1090  7    of such an institute will be a major contribution to
B16 1100  7    the field.
B16 1100  9       The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children,
B16 1110  5    which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coo^rdinating
B16 1120  4    the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations
B16 1130  2    serving handicapped children, of studying the needs
B16 1140  1    of handicapped children in Illinois, and of promoting
B16 1140  9    more adequate services for them, indeed welcomes this
B16 1150  7    new important resource which will help the people of
B16 1160  5    Illinois toward the goal of providing an education
B16 1170  1    for all of its children. @

B16 1220  1    #MORE SCHOOL, LESS PAY#
B16 1220  5    _CHICAGO, AUG. 7_
B16 1220  8       - Is this, perhaps, one of the things that is wrong
B16 1240  8    with our country?
B16 1240 11       Engineering graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology
B16 1250  7    are reported receiving the highest average starting
B16 1260  5    salaries in the school's history- $550 a month.
B16 1270  6       My son, who has completed two years in engineering
B16 1280  1    school, has a summer job on a construction project
B16 1280 10    as an unskilled laborer. At a rate of $3.22 an hour
B16 1290  9    he is now earning approximately $580 a month.
B16 1300  4       Ironic, is it not, that after completing years of
B16 1310  2    costly scientific training he will receive a cut in
B16 1310 11    pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled
B16 1320  8    laborer? @
B16 1320 10    #THE DUPONT CASE#
B16 1330  2    [Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere
B16 1330  9    on this page.]
B16 1340  2    _WASHINGTON, AUG. 4_
B16 1340  5       - Your July 26 editorial regarding the position
B16 1350  3    of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on prospective
B16 1360  1    tax relief for du Pont stockholders is based on an
B16 1360 11    erroneous statement of fact. As a result, your criticism
B16 1370  9    of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the department
B16 1380  7    of justice was inaccurate, unwarranted and unfair.
B16 1390  4       The editorial concerned legislative proposals to
B16 1400  2    ease the tax burden on du Pont stockholders, in connection
B16 1410  1    with the United States Supreme court ruling that du
B16 1410 10    Pont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors
B16 1420  7    stock holdings. These proposals would reduce the amount
B16 1430  5    of tax that du Pont stockholders might have to pay-
B16 1440  4    from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present
B16 1450  1    law to as little as 192 million dollars.
B16 1450  9       Congressman Wilbur D. Mills, chairman of the House
B16 1460  6    Ways and Means committee, asked the department of justice
B16 1470  5    for its views on these legislative proposals as they
B16 1480  3    related to anti-trust law enforcement. The attorney
B16 1480 11    general responded by letter dated July 19. Copies of
B16 1490  9    this letter were made avaliable to the press and public.
B16 1500  7       In this letter, Mr. Kennedy made it clear that he
B16 1510  6    limited his comment only to one consideration- what
B16 1520  4    effect the legislative proposals might have on future
B16 1520 12    anti-trust judgments. There are a number of other considerations
B16 1530  9    besides this one but it is for the Congress, not the
B16 1540 11    department of justice, to balance these various considerations
B16 1550  6    and make a judgment about legislation.
B16 1560  1       Yet your editorial said: "Now the attorney general
B16 1570  1    writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of
B16 1570  9    revenue of this proportion'". What Mr. Kennedy, in
B16 1580  6    fact, wrote was: "It is the department's view that
B16 1590  6    no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any
B16 1600  3    loss of revenue of this proportion".
B16 1610  1       The editorial, by omitting the words anti-trust
B16 1610  8    enforcement, totally distorted Mr. Kennedy's views.
B16 1620  5    The headline is offensive, particularly in view of
B16 1630  4    the total inaccuracy of the editorial. @

B16 1650  5    the futility of writing to Sen. Dirksen and Sen. Douglas.
B16 1660  4       But when you write to Congresswoman Church, bless
B16 1670  3    her heart, your letter is answered fully and completely.
B16 1680  1    Should she disagree, she explains why in detail. When
B16 1680 10    she agrees, you can rest assured her position will
B16 1690  8    remain unchanged.

B16 1770  6    #TOWARD SOCIALISM#
B16 1780  1    _PROVIDENCE, AUG. 5_
B16 1780  3       - Overt socialism means government ownership and
B16 1780  9    management of a nation's main industries. In covert
B16 1790  8    socialism- toward which America is moving- private
B16 1800  6    enterprise retains the ownership title to industries
B16 1810  4    but government thru direct intervention and excessive
B16 1820  1    regulations actually controls them.
B16 1820  5       In order to attract new industries, 15 states or
B16 1830  6    more are issuing tax free bonds to build government
B16 1840  2    owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.
B16 1840 10    This is a step toward overt socialism.
B16 1850  7       Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought
B16 1860  3    new industries to certain regions.
