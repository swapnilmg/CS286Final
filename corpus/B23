B23 0010  1    Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question.
B23 0010 11    I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or,
B23 0020  8    even, of hypocrisy. I never found it among any of the
B23 0030  7    Chinese with whom I spoke, though granted they were,
B23 0040  3    almost all, members of the official family who, presumably,
B23 0050  1    harbor official thoughts. But I questioned, also, professional
B23 0050  9    soldiers, who would not easily be hypnotized by a
B23 0060  9    septuagenarian's
B23 0060 10    dreamy irredentism. Their answer was: it can be done,
B23 0070  9    and we will do it. And then I put the question as pointedly
B23 0080  9    as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek: "In America",
B23 0090  5    I said, "practically no one believes that you subjectively
B23 0100  5    intend to re-enter the Mainland. What evidence is there
B23 0110  4    of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes
B23 0120  2    to do just that, and that it can be done"?
B23 0120 12       He smiled. (He always smiles- at least at visitors,
B23 0130  8    I gather. He smiled also at a British bloke seated
B23 0140  7    next to me, who asked the most asinine questions. I
B23 0150  3    recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's
B23 0160  1    "My Last Duchess". ...) He smiled, and said a word
B23 0170  1    or two to the interpreter, who turned to me, "The President
B23 0170 12    wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei"?
B23 0180  9    That, I smarted, is a royal rebuff if ever there was
B23 0190  9    one.
B23 0190 10       I answered the routine question about my itinerary,
B23 0200  5    rather coolly. Chiang spoke again, this time at greater
B23 0210  4    length. "The President says", the translator came in,
B23 0220  3    "that the reason he asked you where you were going
B23 0220 13    is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas
B23 0230  9    in Southeast Asia, and that everywhere you went, you
B23 0240  6    would seek the answer to your question. He says that
B23 0250  4    if he were to express to you, once again, his own profound
B23 0260  1    determination to go to the Mainland, and his faith
B23 0260 10    that that return is feasible, he would merely sound
B23 0270  7    redundant. So you yourself must seek these objective
B23 0280  4    data, and come to your own conclusions. Any information
B23 0290  1    we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal".
B23 0290 10       Fair enough. What are the relevant data? For every
B23 0300  9    person on Taiwan, there are sixty in Mainland China.
B23 0310  6    If the raw population figures are crucially relevant,
B23 0320  3    then it is idle to think of liberation, as idle as
B23 0330  1    to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia. Relative
B23 0330  9    military manpower? Less than 60-1, but at least 6-1.
B23 0340 10    The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese
B23 0350  7    army. Say four million. The armed forces of Taiwan
B23 0360  4    are at a working strength of about 450,000, though
B23 0370  1    a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.
B23 0370  9    Skill? Training? Morale? It is generally conceded that
B23 0380  7    the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia,
B23 0390  8    and the army the best trained. The morale is very high.
B23 0400  4       Even so, it adds up to impossible odds, except that
B23 0410  2    the question arises, On whose side would the Mainland
B23 0410 11    Chinese army fight?
B23 0420  3       The miserable people of China, the largest cast
B23 0430  1    ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play,
B23 0430  9    cannot themselves resist overtly. They think, perforce,
B23 0440  6    of physical survival: everything else is secondary.
B23 0450  5    But the army which Mao continues to feed well, where
B23 0460  3    are its sympathies? The psychological strategists in
B23 0470  1    Taiwan stress the great sense of family, cultivated
B23 0470  9    in China over thousands of years. It has not been extirpated
B23 0480  9    by ten years of Communist depersonalization. Every
B23 0490  3    soldier in the army has, somewhere, relatives who are
B23 0500  3    close to starvation. The soldiers themselves cannot
B23 0500 10    stage a successful rebellion, it is assumed: but will
B23 0510  9    their discontent spread to the officer class? The immediate
B23 0520  8    families of the generals and the admirals are well
B23 0530  6    fed: a despot does not economize on his generals. But
B23 0540  3    there are the cousins and aunts and nephews. Their
B23 0540 12    privations are almost beyond endurance. In behalf of
B23 0550  8    what? Leninism-Marxism, as understood by Exegete Mao.
B23 0560  6    To whom will the generals stay loyal? There is little
B23 0570  5    doubt if they had a secret ballot, they would vote
B23 0580  3    for food for their family, in place of ideological
B23 0580 12    purity out on the farm. It is another question whether
B23 0590  9    "they"- or a single general, off in a corner of China,
B23 0600  8    secure for a few (galvanizing?) days at least from
B23 0610  5    instant retaliation- will defy the Party. But the disposition
B23 0620  3    to rebel is most definitely there.
B23 0620  9    ##
B23 0620 10    But there must be a catalytic pressure. The military
B23 0630  8    in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two
B23 0640  6    mistakes, which, together, may prove fatal. The first
B23 0650  3    was the commune program, which will ensure agricultural
B23 0660  1    poverty for years. The family is largely broken up;
B23 0660 10    and where it is not, it is left with no residue, and
B23 0670 10    the social meaning of this is enormous. For it is the
B23 0680  6    family that, in China, has always provided social security
B23 0690  2    for the indigent, the sick, the down-and-out members
B23 0690 12    of the clan. Now the government must do that; but the
B23 0700 11    government is left with no reserve granary, under the
B23 0710  8    agricultural system it has ordained. Thus the government
B23 0720  4    simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social
B23 0730  2    security which had traditionally been privately discharged,
B23 0730  9    and created a national scarcity which has engendered
B23 0740  8    calamitous problems of social security.
B23 0750  4       The second mistake is Tibet. Tibet has historically
B23 0760  2    served China as a buffer state. A friendly state, sometimes
B23 0770  1    only semi-independent, but never hostile. China never
B23 0770  9    tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's
B23 0780  7    religion and institutions. Red China is trying to do
B23 0790  7    this, and she is not likely ever to succeed. Tibet
B23 0800  2    is too vast, the terrain is too difficult. Tibet may
B23 0800 12    bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France.
B23 0810  7       These continuing pressures, social, economic and
B23 0820  5    military, are doing much to keep China in a heightening
B23 0830  4    state of tension. The imposition of yet another pressure,
B23 0840  1    a strong one, from the outside, might cause it to snap.
B23 0840 12    ##
B23 0840 13    The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men.
B23 0850  9    They know that they must depend heavily on factors
B23 0860  7    outside their own control. First and foremost, they
B23 0870  4    depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.
B23 0880  1    On these they feel they can rely. Secondly, they depend
B23 0880 11    on America's "moral cooperation" when the crucial moment
B23 0890  7    arrives. They hope that if history vouchsafes the West
B23 0900  8    another Budapest, we will receive the opportunity gladly.
B23 0910  5    I remarked jocularly to the President that the future
B23 0920  4    of China would be far more certain if he would invite
B23 0930  1    a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy
B23 0930  9    on an odd day. He affected (most properly) not to understand
B23 0940  9    my point. But he- and all of China- wear the scars
B23 0950 10    of American indecisiveness, and he knows what an uncertain
B23 0960  6    ally we are. We have been grand to Formosa itself-
B23 0970  1    lots of aid, and, most of the time, a policy of support
B23 0980  1    for the offshore islands. But our outlook has been,
B23 0980 10    and continues to be, defensive. A great deal depends
B23 0990  7    on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the
B23 1000  5    world struggle. The Free Chinese know that the situation
B23 1010  3    on the Mainland is in flux, and are poised to strike.
B23 1020  1    There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a
B23 1020 11    more highly mobilized force for liberation. The moment
B23 1040  3    of truth is the moment of crisis. During the slow buildup,
B23 1050  1    the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under
B23 1050 12    embroidered details, fine words, strutting gestures.
B23 1060  5    The crisis burns these suddenly away. There the truth
B23 1070  5    is, open to eyes that are willing to look. The moment
B23 1080  2    passes. New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed
B23 1080 10    on the too-naked bones.
B23 1090  2       A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for
B23 1100  1    a couple of days this month, to be quickly smothered
B23 1100 11    by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap
B23 1110  8    for such emergencies. Before memory, too, clouds over,
B23 1120  4    let us make a note or two of what could be seen.
B23 1130  1       The measure was instantly taken, as always in such
B23 1130 10    cases, of public men at many levels. One knows better,
B23 1140  9    now, who has bone and who has jelly in his spine. But
B23 1150  7    I am here concerned more with policy than with men.
B23 1160  4    Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.
B23 1170  1       Now, everyone knows- or knew in the week of December
B23 1170 11    10- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American
B23 1180 11    foreign policy. The United States was engaged in a
B23 1190  8    military attack on a peaceful, orderly people governed
B23 1200  4    by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western
B23 1210  3    and anti-Communist within any of the new nations- the
B23 1220  2    only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive
B23 1220 10    relationship between whites and blacks had apparently
B23 1230  7    been achieved. Of course the fighting was officially
B23 1240  4    under the auspices of the United Nations. But in the
B23 1250  3    moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was
B23 1260  1    in reality the principal.
B23 1260  5       The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis
B23 1270  4    our policy ran counter to that of all our NATO allies,
B23 1280  2    to the entire Western community. By our policy the
B23 1280 11    West was- is- split.
B23 1290  5       But the key revelation is not new. The controlling
B23 1300  1    pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis
B23 1300 10    of November 1956. It reappears, in whole or part, whenever
B23 1310  9    a new crisis exposes the reality: in Cuba last spring
B23 1320  8    (with which the Dominican events of last month should
B23 1330  6    be paired); at the peaks of the nuclear test and the
B23 1340  4    Berlin cycles; in relation to Laos, Algeria, South
B23 1350  1    Africa; right now, with almost cartoon emphasis, in
B23 1350  9    the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana.
B23 1360  8    #WHAT THE MOMENTS REVEAL#
B23 1370  2    This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:
B23 1380  1    Under prevailing policy, the U. S. can take the initiative
B23 1390  1    against the Right, but cannot take the initiative against
B23 1390 10    the Left. It makes no difference what part of the world
B23 1400 10    is involved, what form of regime, what particular issue.
B23 1410  6    The U. S. cannot take the initiative against the Left.
B23 1420  5    There is even some question whether the U. S. can any
B23 1430  6    longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left.
B23 1440  4       We can attack Tshombe, but not Gigenza. No matter
B23 1450  2    that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo. No matter
B23 1450 12    that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat
B23 1460 11    Western men. No matter that the Katanga operation is
B23 1470  6    strategically insane in terms of Western interests
B23 1480  2    in Africa. (Even granted that the Congo should be unified,
B23 1490  2    you don't protect Western security by first removing
B23 1500  1    the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium.)
B23 1500  9       We can force Britain and France out of the Suez,
B23 1510  8    but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks
B23 1520  6    back from Budapest. We can mass our fleet against the
B23 1530  4    Trujillos, but not against the Castros. We can vote
B23 1540  2    in the UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese
B23 1540 11    rule in Angola, but we cannot even introduce a motion
B23 1550 10    on the Berlin Wall- much less, give the simple order
B23 1560  9    to push the Wall down. We officially receive the anti-French,
B23 1570  5    Moscow-allied Algerian FLN, but we denounce the pro-Europe,
B23 1580  7    anti-Communist OAS as criminal.
B23 1590  1       In the very week of our war against Katanga, we
B23 1590 11    make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah, who has
B23 1600  8    just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc,
B23 1610  5    and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian
B23 1620  3    dictatorship. As our planes land the war materiel that
B23 1630  1    kills pro-Western Katangans, we stand supinely bleating
B23 1630  9    while Nehru's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old
B23 1640  9    district of our NATO ally, Portugal.
B23 1650  3       What explains this uni-directional paralysis? It
B23 1660  2    is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes
B23 1670  1    the frame of our international- and in some degree
B23 1670 10    our domestic- policy. The Suez-Hungary crisis proves
B23 1680  9    that this system was not invented by the new Administration,
B23 1690  6    but only made more consistent and more active.
B23 1700  3    #KEY TO THE PUZZLES#
B23 1700  7    Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa,
B23 1710  4    Katanga and Ghana, as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before
B23 1720  2    them, is the belief that the main theater of the world
B23 1720 13    drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia, Africa
B23 1730  8    and Latin America. From this belief is derived the
B23 1740  7    practical orientation of our policy on the "uncommitted"
B23 1750  4    ("neutralist", "contested") nations, especially on
B23 1760  3    those whose leaders make the most noise- Nehru, Tito,
B23 1770  1    Nkrumah, Sukarno, Betancourt, etc. Our chief aim becomes
B23 1770  9    that of finding favor in neutralist eyes.
B23 1780  7       If we grasp this orientation as a key, our national
B23 1790  6    conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes
B23 1800  2    intelligible. And it becomes clear why in general we
B23 1800 11    cannot take the initiative against the Left.
