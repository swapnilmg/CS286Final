N24 0010  1    Now, the next morning, they were anchored at The Elbow
N24 0010 11    and the boat was riding directly over the underwater
N24 0020  7    ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue
N24 0030  4    and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms, with
N24 0040  2    the weighted line beside it; and Robinson Roy, who
N24 0040 11    had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a
N24 0050 10    new depth record for the free dive, was already back
N24 0060  5    on the surface.
N24 0060  8       He and his safety man, Herr Schaffner, swam up to
N24 0070  6    the boarding ladder together. The German courteously
N24 0080  2    indicated that Robinson should mount first. Robinson
N24 0090  1    clambered heavily into the boat, sat down, and stripped
N24 0090 10    off his triple-tank assembly. He was frowning. He took
N24 0100  7    his mask from his forehead and threw it, unexpectedly,
N24 0110  5    across the deck.
N24 0110  8       "Temper, temper", Mrs. Forsythe said, laughing uneasily.
N24 0120  6    A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty,
N24 0130  7    but irreparably stringy in the neck, she was already
N24 0140  4    working on her second gin and tonic, though it was
N24 0150  1    not yet ten A.M.
N24 0150  5       "I loused it", Rob said, with a savage note in his
N24 0160  5    voice. "All I have to do to set the record is to go
N24 0170  2    on down. So instead I come up".
N24 0170  9       "Was it my equipment"? the German asked. "Was it
N24 0180  6    something went bad with the breathing"?
N24 0190  1       "The equipment was fine", Rob stated, standing up.
N24 0200  2    He was a huge young man of twenty-four, clothed in
N24 0200 13    muscle, immensely strong, with a habitual gentleness
N24 0210  6    and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his
N24 0220  5    present agitation. He stared stonily at the floor.
N24 0230  2    "I was down to 275. I've been that far half a dozen
N24 0230 14    times. I don't get it why this time I should pull such
N24 0240 12    a stupid trick".
N24 0250  1       "Well, I get it", Artie said, still on the ladder.
N24 0250 11    "You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea
N24 0260 12    about setting a record. And you also got this little
N24 0270  9    spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around
N24 0280  6    before you drown yourself. So you turn around".
N24 0290  1       "No, it wasn't that", Rob said. A note of awe came
N24 0300  1    into his voice. "When I came up, damnit, I thought
N24 0300 11    I was going down. I came up maybe fifty feet before
N24 0310  9    I knew what was happening".
N24 0320  1       "Pressure-happy", Artie said, and climbed in.
N24 0330  1       "That's right", Robinson said. "I was expecting
N24 0330  8    it, sure. But when it happens to you like that, I tell
N24 0340 11    you, and you're a hundred feet from where you thought
N24 0350  7    you were- well, it makes you think. You don't head
N24 0360  4    back down again. Not me, anyway. Not right away". He
N24 0370  2    had his voice under control again: no one became aware
N24 0370 12    that he was terrified by what had just happened to
N24 0380 10    him.
N24 0380 11       Waddell, the newspaperman, was a fellow in his middle
N24 0390  9    forties, with a graying crewcut, heavy-framed glasses,
N24 0400  4    and a large jaw padded with fat. Now he was going to
N24 0410  4    show how much he knew. "Our boy didn't chicken out,
N24 0420  1    no sir. He ran into the rapture of the depths. Nitrogen
N24 0420 12    narcosis. It makes the diver feel drunk".
N24 0430  6       "Well, that's the only way to be", Mrs. Forsythe
N24 0440  5    said, and gave her brassy laugh.
N24 0450  1       "Maybe not, if you're 200 feet under water", Artie
N24 0450  9    said.
N24 0460  1       "Anyway", Waddell went on. "it's nothing to fool
N24 0460  9    with. It can kill you. Personally, I don't blame him
N24 0470  9    for giving up the dive, much as I regret losing the
N24 0480  7    story".
N24 0480  8       "Nobody's giving anything up", Robinson said. He
N24 0490  6    stood there, towering over them all: gentle, mighty,
N24 0500  4    determined, the moving force in the group; and yet
N24 0510  2    like a child among adults. "You think I got you and
N24 0510 13    Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just
N24 0520  9    for the boat ride? I'm going down again".
N24 0530  4       "That's my boy"! Mr. Forsythe exclaimed. "Rob's
N24 0540  3    not going to give up as easy as all that". He was a
N24 0550  4    florid, puffy man in his early sixties, very natty
N24 0550 13    in his yachting cap, striped jacket and white flannels.
N24 0560  8    He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the
N24 0570  8    only man in town who did not know that his title of
N24 0580  5    "Commodore" was never used without irony. Old Commodore
N24 0590  2    Forsythe, who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether
N24 0600  1    he could get both motors started and turn on the running
N24 0600 12    lights without accidentally turning on something else
N24 0610  6    first. Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether
N24 0620  7    it was wise for Robinson to dive again: Rob was his
N24 0630  4    boy, the kid he had rescued from the streets, the object
N24 0640  1    of his pride.
N24 0640  4       "Why", he went on, "when Rob asked me if he could
N24 0650  4    make his dive on this trip, I didn't think twice about
N24 0660  1    it. I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster
N24 0660 12    hanging around his brother's tackle shop. Hell, I gave
N24 0670  8    him the first decent job he ever had, six, seven- how
N24 0680  8    many years ago was it, Rob"?
N24 0690  1       "Seven years ago, Commodore", Rob said impassively.
N24 0690  8    He was thinking, big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing
N24 0700  9    parties for seven years and no better off than when
N24 0710  8    I started. "Excuse me", he said abruptly. He went down
N24 0720  6    the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters; went
N24 0730  2    into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind
N24 0730 11    him.
N24 0740  1       "When you gotta go, you gotta go", Mrs. Forsythe
N24 0740 10    said.
N24 0750  1       Waddell muttered something about taking a look around
N24 0750  9    and climbed up to the flying bridge. He was disturbed
N24 0760 10    by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered
N24 0770  9    of a conversation he had had the night before with
N24 0780  4    the German, who had come out of the head while he was
N24 0790  2    fixing himself a drink in the galley.
N24 0790  9       "Hi there, Schaffner", he had said. "Can I make
N24 0800  7    you one"?
N24 0800  9       "No thank you very much", Schaffner had answered
N24 0810  7    in his accented English. "I do not drink so much, thank
N24 0820  8    you".
N24 0820  9       Waddell had looked the man over, trying to size
N24 0830  6    him up. He was in his early forties, rather short and
N24 0840  3    very compactly built, and with a manner that was reserved
N24 0850  1    and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American
N24 0850 11    ways. His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence,
N24 0860 10    until one looked into his eyes, which had no warmth
N24 0870  7    in them but only alert intelligence. Waddell had heard
N24 0880  4    that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps,
N24 0890  2    and he said to himself: I'd hate to run into him in
N24 0890 14    the desert on a dark night. Aloud he had said, making
N24 0900 10    conversation:
N24 0910  1       "Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment
N24 0910  9    on the dive".
N24 0920  1       "Yes", Herr Schaffner had said.
N24 0920  6       "He's one hell of a decent boy. I like that kid".
N24 0930 10       "I agree, yes".
N24 0940  1       "And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import
N24 0950  1    rights to your line for this country, is that right"?
N24 0950 11       "Well, no", Herr Schaffner said.
N24 0960  5       Waddell turned to face him. "No"? he asked. "But
N24 0970  5    that's what he told me. Why, that's his main reason
N24 0980  4    for making the dive".
N24 0980  8       Shaffner looked at him, altogether without guile,
N24 0990  5    and shrugged his shoulders, making a little spreading
N24 1000  3    gesture with his two hands.
N24 1000  8       "What do you mean"? Waddell asked, frowning.
N24 1010  4       "Please let me explain", the German said earnestly,
N24 1020  5    his face still devoid of deceit. "I have in Europe
N24 1030  3    a gross business of seven million dollars the year.
N24 1030 12    Now I wish to enter the American market, where the
N24 1040 10    competition is very strong. I must have a powerful
N24 1050  7    representative here, a firm with a national distribution
N24 1060  2    and ten, twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products.
N24 1070  2    With all respect to a fine young man, Mr. Roy is not
N24 1070 14    able to provide these necessaries".
N24 1080  5       Waddell was not an eminently moral person, but he
N24 1090  5    did not like what he had just heard. "Did you tell
N24 1100  2    him all this"? he asked.
N24 1100  7       "Perhaps not in so many words", the German said.
N24 1110  5    "But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy. Never,
N24 1120  3    never did I offer him the exclusive rights. We spoke
N24 1130  1    of the need for advertising, and I agreed that the
N24 1130 11    deep dive would be most useful for publicity. He was
N24 1140  8    most eager to make the dive; of course, I was willing.
N24 1150  6    But there was no definite agreement about business
N24 1160  2    arrangements".
N24 1160  3       "Well, damn", Waddell said. There was the end of
N24 1170  5    his front-page feature story, with byline. He started
N24 1180  1    out the door.
N24 1180  4       "One moment"! Herr Schaffner said. "You intend to
N24 1190  3    speak with Mr. Roy"?
N24 1190  7       "What else"? Waddell asked.
N24 1200  3       "If you will pardon, I think it would be better
N24 1210  2    if not. Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive. Whatever
N24 1220  1    you tell him he will dive. I know this from my talks
N24 1220 13    with him".
N24 1230  1       "Well, let's let him make up his own mind, OK"?
N24 1230 11    Waddell said. "On the basis of the facts".
N24 1240  8       "You will make him unhappy and anxious", the German
N24 1250  7    said. "At 200, 300, 400 feet under the water, when
N24 1260  5    he must be paying very much attention, he will be thinking
N24 1270  3    about what you are telling him. It is not good, Mr.
N24 1280  1    Waddell: you will do him great harm".
N24 1280  8       There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every
N24 1290  6    word of what he said. Waddell came back from the door
N24 1300  5    and sat on a bunk.
N24 1300 10       "I am an honest man", the German said with fervor.
N24 1310  6    "I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive. I will
N24 1320  5    make him distributor for all of Florida- a big market.
N24 1330  2    All tourists come to Florida. This will help him to
N24 1330 12    get out of his little tackle shop. Yes! But there is
N24 1340 10    no use causing him to worry at this time".
N24 1350  6       The German's words worked on the newspaperman like
N24 1360  3    a reprieve from an odious duty. He took a big swig
N24 1370  1    of his drink. It would be a colossal shame to throw
N24 1370 12    away a story like this. "I think maybe you're right,
N24 1380  7    Schaffner", he said. "He has the distributorship for
N24 1390  5    Florida, you say"?
N24 1390  8       "Yes", the German said. "At least for South Florida".
N24 1400  9       "By God", Waddell said, "we don't want to upset
N24 1410  9    the boy at this time of all times. I guess you're right".
N24 1420  9    He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few
N24 1430  8    large gulps. The story was shaping up nicely in his
N24 1440  4    mind: the young pioneer, as of old, altruistically
N24 1440 12    braving the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in
N24 1450  9    modern big-business America. "Join me in another"?
N24 1460  6    he had asked.
N24 1460  9       "Thank you", the German had said courteously. "I
N24 1470  8    do not drink so much".
N24 1480  1    ##
N24 1480  2    Now, in that same cabin, Robinson fell to his knees
N24 1480 12    beside a bunk. Fear and relief mingled in his churning
N24 1490 10    emotions. He pressed his palms together and addressed
N24 1500  6    himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried
N24 1510  4    and anxious whisper.
N24 1510  7       "Blessed Saint Nicholas, I thank thee for getting
N24 1520  6    me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down
N24 1530  4    when I was bewildered. And when I make the dive again"-
N24 1540  3    He paused; crossed himself; said a Hail Mary, slowly
N24 1540 12    and with understanding. Folding between his hands the
N24 1550  8    cross that hung from his neck, he took his appeal direct
N24 1560  9    to Headquarters. "Holy Mary, Mother of God, Star of
N24 1570  6    the Sea, stay Thou with me on this next dive. Make
N24 1580  3    it come off all right. Let me set the record this time,
N24 1590  1    and let me get back OK, so the German will give me
N24 1590 13    the exclusive. And make my life different and better
N24 1600  8    from this time on. Amen".
N24 1610  1       He crossed himself again and rose. He felt a good
N24 1610 11    deal less shaky. As he reached for the door there was
N24 1620 10    a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie, who
N24 1630  7    came in and sat down on a bunk. Artie had picked up
N24 1640  4    a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger. He
N24 1640 14    waited awhile before he said, "Roy, you know your decompression
N24 1650 10    table, don't you"?
N24 1660  3       "You know I know it", Robinson answered warily.
N24 1670  2       "You came straight up from 275 without a stop",
N24 1690  1    Artie said.
N24 1690  3       "Well, I was a little bit confused. Anyway, I wasn't
N24 1700  3    down long enough to matter. You don't see me stretched
N24 1710  1    out on the deck, do you"?
N24 1720  6       "You know what they say about two deep dives in
N24 1730  4    one day", Artie went on, still twirling the snorkle
N24 1730 13    and studying it intently. "I don't think you should
N24 1740  9    go down again".
