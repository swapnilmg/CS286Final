B10 0010  1    _MIAMI, FLA., MARCH 17._
B10 0010  5       An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today
B10 0020  3    and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball
B10 0030  1    club would be improved this year.
B10 0030  7       Now Richards, of course, is known as a deep thinker
B10 0040  6    as baseball managers go. He can often make the complex
B10 0050  2    ridiculously simple, and vice versa. This happened
B10 0050  9    to be vice versa, but even so, the answer was a masterpiece.
B10 0060  4       "It's a whole lot easier", he said, "to increase
B10 0070  3    the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the
B10 0080  1    population of New York city". And with that he walked
B10 0080 11    off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher.
B10 0090  6       "That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote", said the
B10 0100  6    writer, scratching his head. "Now, if I can just figure
B10 0110  4    out what he's talking about, I'll use it".
B10 0120  1    #TWO SPOTS OPEN#
B10 0120  3    This was just Richard's way of saying that last year
B10 0130  2    the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs
B10 0130 12    wide open. Some brilliant rookies nailed them down,
B10 0140  7    so that this spring just two spots, left and right
B10 0150  5    field, are really up for grabs.
B10 0150 11       It should be easier to plug two spots than it was
B10 0160 10    to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year,
B10 0170  6    but so far it hasn't worked that way.
B10 0180  1       This angle of just where the Orioles can look for
B10 0180 11    improvement this year is an interesting one. You'd
B10 0190  7    never guess it from the way they've played so far this
B10 0200  5    spring, but there remains a feeling among some around
B10 0210  2    here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle
B10 0210 12    for the pennant in 1961.
B10 0220  4       Obviously, if this club is going to move from second
B10 0230  2    to first in the American League, it will have to show
B10 0230 13    improvement someplace. Where can that improvement possibly
B10 0240  7    come from?
B10 0250  1       You certainly can't expect the infield to do any
B10 0250 10    better than it did last year.
B10 0260  5    #ROBBY COULD BE BETTER#
B10 0260  9    Brooks Robinson is great, and it is conceivable that
B10 0270  6    he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960. You
B10 0280  5    can't expect it, though. Robby's performance last year
B10 0290  2    was tremendous.
B10 0290  4       It's the same with Ron Hansen and jim Gentile. If
B10 0300  4    they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no
B10 0310  1    complaint. They shouldn't be asked to carry any more
B10 0310 10    of the burden.
B10 0320  1       Hansen will be getting a late spring training start,
B10 0320 10    which might very well set him back. He got off to an
B10 0330 11    exceptional start last season, and under the circumstances
B10 0340  5    probably won't duplicate it.
B10 0350  1       There are some clubs which claim they learned something
B10 0350 10    about pitching to him last year. They don't expect
B10 0360  8    to stop him, just slow him down some with the bat.
B10 0370  6    He'll still be a top player, they concede, because
B10 0380  2    he's got a great glove and the long ball going for
B10 0380 13    him. But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive
B10 0390  9    production.
B10 0390 10    #BREEDING MIGHT MOVE UP#
B10 0400  4    Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.
B10 0410  1    Don't ask him more.
B10 0410  5       I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch.
B10 0420  4    But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do
B10 0430  1    too much better.
B10 0430  4       So, all in all, the infield can't be expected to
B10 0440  2    supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from
B10 0440 11    second to first.
B10 0450  3       And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.
B10 0470  1    Richards got a great performance out of his combination
B10 0470 10    of youth and experience last season.
B10 0480  4       Where, then, can we look for improvement?
B10 0500  1       "From Triandos, Brandt and Walker", answers Richards.
B10 0510  1    "They're the ones we can expect to do better".
B10 0510 10       The man is right, and at this time, indications
B10 0520  9    are that these three are ready for better seasons.
B10 0530  5       Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but he says he's
B10 0540  4    convinced his thumb is all right. He jammed it this
B10 0550  1    spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old
B10 0550 13    injury hasn't bothered him. If he can bounce back with
B10 0560  8    one of those 25 home runs years, the club will have
B10 0570  5    to be better off offensively.
B10 0570 10       I'm still not convinced, though, I'll have to see
B10 0580  8    more of him before predicting that big year for him.
B10 0590  6    Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House who will be within
B10 0610  5    calling distance in the minors, make up better second
B10 0620  1    line catching than the Birds had all last year, but
B10 0620 11    Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking
B10 0630 10    pennant.
B10 0630 11       To me, Brandt looks as though he could be in for
B10 0640  9    a fine year. He hasn't played too much, because Richards
B10 0650  5    has been working on him furiously in batting practice.
B10 0660  2    He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and
B10 0670  1    his whole attitude is improved over this time last
B10 0670 10    year.
B10 0670 11       When he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team
B10 0680 10    which was supposed to win the National League pennant,
B10 0690  5    and he was joining what seemed to be a second division
B10 0700  4    American League club. He was down, hard to talk to,
B10 0710  1    and far too nonchalant on the field. As of now, that
B10 0710 12    all seems behind him. He's been entirely different
B10 0720  6    all spring.
B10 0720  8       And Walker looks stronger, seems to be throwing
B10 0730  7    better than he did last year. Let him bounce back,
B10 0740  4    and he could really set up the staff.
B10 0740 12       So, if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos
B10 0750  9    and Walker will have to do it.
B10 0760  4       So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't
B10 0770  1    seem capable of carrying the load.
B10 0770  7       Of course, this isn't taking into consideration
B10 0780  4    the population of Nevada and New York city, but it's
B10 0790  4    the way things look from here at this point.
B10 0800  1       Is the mother of an "autistic" child at fault? (The
B10 0800 11    "autistic" child is one who seems to lack a well-defined
B10 0810 11    sense of self. He tends to treat himself and other
B10 0820  8    people as if they were objects- and sometimes he treats
B10 0830  7    objects as if they were people.) Did his mother make
B10 0840  3    him this way?
B10 0840  6       Some people believe she did.
B10 0850  1       We think differently. We believe that autism, like
B10 0850  9    so many other conditions of defect and deviation, is
B10 0860  6    to a large extent inborn. A mother can help a child
B10 0870  5    adapt to his difficulties.
B10 0870  9       Sometimes she can- to a large extent- help him overcome
B10 0880  8    them. But we don't think she creates them. We don't
B10 0890  6    think she can make her child defective, emotionally
B10 0900  2    disturbed or autistic.
B10 0900  5       The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal
B10 0910  7    to help her own child and often, by sharing her experiences,
B10 0920  3    she can help other mothers with the same problem. Since
B10 0930  2    little is known about autism, and almost nothing has
B10 0930 11    been written for the layman, we'd like to share one
B10 0940  9    experienced mother's comments. She wrote:
B10 0950  3    #TOTAL DISINTEREST#
B10 0950  5    "As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking
B10 0960  5    in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything, I
B10 0970  2    have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he
B10 0980  1    first plays with a new toy. He wants me to do everything
B10 0990 12    for him.
B10 1000  1       "You don't believe that autistic children become
B10 1000  7    autistic because of something that happens to them
B10 1010  6    or because of the way their mother treats them. But
B10 1020  3    I do and my psychiatrist does, too. I know, that my
B10 1030  1    son wants control and direction, but being autistic
B10 1030  9    myself I cannot give full control or direction.
B10 1040  5       "One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned.
B10 1050  5    This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact
B10 1060  3    with others- for instance, my children and I. When
B10 1070  2    I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms
B10 1070 14    until he is as straight and stiff as a board. He pushes
B10 1080 10    and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling
B10 1090  8    of being held. Physical contact is uncomforatble for
B10 1100  3    him"!
B10 1100  4       This mother is quite correct. As a rule, the autistic
B10 1110  5    child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others. Parents
B10 1120  2    have to find other ways of comforting him. For the
B10 1120 12    young child this may be no more than providing food,
B10 1130 10    light or movement. As he grows older it may be a matter
B10 1140  9    of providing some accustomed object (his "magic" thing).
B10 1150  4    Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go
B10 1160  3    through may do the trick. The answer is different for
B10 1160 13    each autistic child, but for most there is an answer.
B10 1170  9    Only ingenuity will uncover it.
B10 1180  2    #WHAT FUTURE HOLDS#
B10 1180  5    "Dear Doctors: We learned this year that our older
B10 1190  5    son, Daniel, is autistic. We did not accept the diagnosis
B10 1200  2    at once, but gradually we are coming to. Fortunately,
B10 1200 11    there is a nursery school which he has been able to
B10 1210 11    attend, with a group of normal children.
B10 1220  4       "I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal, though
B10 1230  2    of course I realize he is far from that at present.
B10 1230 13    What I do is to try to bring him into contact with
B10 1240 12    reality as much as possible. I try to give him as many
B10 1250  8    normal experiences as possible.
B10 1260  1       "What is your experience with autistic children?
B10 1260  8    How do they turn out later"?
B10 1270  4       Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively
B10 1280  2    normal lives. Certainly, most continue to lack a certain
B10 1280 11    warmth in communication with other people, but many
B10 1290  8    adjust to school, even college, to jobs and even to
B10 1300  7    marriage and parenthood.
B10 1300 10    #SINGLE-COLOR USE#
B10 1320  1    _QUESTION_
B10 1320  1       - A first grader colors pictures one solid color,
B10 1330  1    everything- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc. When different
B10 1330  8    colors are used, she is just as likely to color trees
B10 1340 11    purple, hair green, etc.
B10 1350  2       The other children in the class use this same coloring
B10 1360  1    book and do a fairly good job with things their proper
B10 1360 12    color. Should I show my daughter how things should
B10 1370  8    be colored? She is an aggressive, nervous child. Is
B10 1380  4    a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow
B10 1390  3    these traits?
B10 1390  5    _ANSWER_
B10 1390  6       - Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying
B10 1400  6    the motor act of coloring, without having reached the
B10 1410  3    point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.
B10 1420  1    This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is
B10 1420 11    a little immature for the first grade.
B10 1430  5       No, coloring isn't exactly something you teach a
B10 1440  4    child. You sometimes give them a little demonstration,
B10 1450  1    a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside
B10 1450  9    the lines. But most learn to color and paint as and
B10 1460  9    when they are ready with only a very little demonstration.
B10 1480  1       SEEN in decorating circles of late is a renewed
B10 1480 10    interest in an old art: embroidery. Possibly responsible
B10 1490  8    for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes
B10 1500  5    in rooms, which seems slated to replace the one-color
B10 1510  5    look to which we have been accustomed. Just as a varitinted
B10 1520  3    Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room
B10 1520 13    scheme, so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.
B10 1530 10       One such, in fact, is a rug. Though not actually
B10 1540  9    crewel embroidery, it has that look with its over-stitched
B10 1550  7    raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze and gold and a
B10 1560  5    sauterne background. The twirled, stylized design of
B10 1570  1    winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the
B10 1570  9    embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery
B10 1580  6    during the Jacobean period in England.
B10 1590  2       Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be
B10 1590  9    appearing more frequently this fall than in the past
B10 1600  9    few years is still available in this country. The work
B10 1610  6    is executed in England (by hand) and can be worked
B10 1620  4    in any desired design and color.
B10 1620 10       Among some recent imports were seat covers for one
B10 1630  7    series of dining room chairs on which were depicted
B10 1640  4    salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and
B10 1650  2    another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic
B10 1650 12    color.
B10 1660  1    #CHINESE INFLUENCE#
B10 1660  3    For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection
B10 1670  3    of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall
B10 1670 10    panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired
B10 1680  8    design of this revered Eighteenth Century period. Since
B10 1690  6    the work is done by hand, the only limitation, it is
B10 1700  6    said, "is that of human conception".
B10 1710  1       Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be
B10 1710  9    hung on the wall, are another aspect of this trend.
B10 1720  8    These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian
B10 1730  4    homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there
B10 1740  2    in shops which specialize in handicrafts. An amateur
B10 1740 10    decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long
B10 1750 11    winter evenings, and, by picking up her living room
B10 1760  6    color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself note
B10 1770  2    to the room.
