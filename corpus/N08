N08 0010  1    If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part
N08 0010 10    of her mother, she did not comment upon it.
N08 0020  6       After they had finished eating, Melissa took Sprite
N08 0030  3    the kitten under her arm- "so that Auntie Grace can
N08 0040  2    teach it about the whistle"- and climbed into the station
N08 0040 12    wagon beside her mother. She had offered to walk, but
N08 0050 10    Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her
N08 0060  7    child until she had personally confided her to the
N08 0070  4    care of the little pink woman who chose to be called
N08 0080  1    "Auntie".
N08 0080  2       When they reached their neighbor's house, Pamela
N08 0090  1    said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa
N08 0090 11    lightly on the forehead, the impulse prompted by a
N08 0100  8    stray thought- of the type to which she was frequently
N08 0110  6    subject these days- that they might never see one another
N08 0120  4    again. Then she turned the station wagon around and
N08 0130  1    headed it back down the hill, with the village as her
N08 0130 12    ostensible destination.
N08 0140  1       As she drove, she thought about her plan. It was
N08 0140 11    really quite simple. So simple, in fact, that it might
N08 0150 10    even work- although Pamela, now, in her new frame of
N08 0160  8    mind, was careful not to pretend too much assurance.
N08 0170  4    That mistake, she thought, had cost her dearly these
N08 0180  2    past few days, and she wanted to avoid falling into
N08 0180 12    any more of the traps that the mountain might set for
N08 0190  9    her. She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming
N08 0200  8    forest.
N08 0200  9       When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty
N08 0210  6    dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house,
N08 0220  2    Pamela turned the wheel, guiding the car to its familiar
N08 0230  1    parking spot close to the house, and stopped. All of
N08 0230 11    her movements were careful and methodical, partaking
N08 0240  6    of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony
N08 0250  5    for months in advance and knows exactly which step
N08 0260  2    to take next in the course of the final execution of
N08 0260 13    his crime. She locked the ignition, removed the keys,
N08 0270  8    stepped out of the car and went into the house. Here,
N08 0280  6    she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door
N08 0290  3    and went upstairs to her bedroom.
N08 0290  9       On her bureau lay a small, brass ornament of simple
N08 0300  7    design and faded engraving- an object which, Pamela
N08 0310  4    believed now, had been the property of her great-grandfather,
N08 0320  1    Major Hiram Munroe Culver. He had belonged to this
N08 0330  1    land and, perhaps, had desecrated it- and this was
N08 0330 10    the only material symbol that remained of him. If she,
N08 0340  8    Pamela, were being held responsible for his crimes,
N08 0350  4    then hers must be the final act of expiation. She would
N08 0360  2    return this symbol to the mountain, as one pours seed
N08 0360 12    back into the soil every Spring ... or as ancient fertility
N08 0370 10    cults demand annual human sacrifice.
N08 0380  3       Slowly and thoughtfully, she slipped the ornament
N08 0390  2    into the pocket of her slacks, moved down the stairs
N08 0390 12    and out of the house. There was only one place where
N08 0400 10    the mountain might receive her- that unnamed, unnameable
N08 0410  4    pool harbored in its secret bosom. Atonement, if atonement
N08 0420  4    were possible, could only be made at that sacred, sacrificial
N08 0430  2    basin. It was there that she would have to enact her
N08 0440  1    renunciation, beg forgiveness.
N08 0440  4       Perhaps it was insane, Pamela thought. Perhaps it
N08 0450  4    was all a vividly conceived dream. But she was caught
N08 0460  2    in it, and she faced the terrible possibility that,
N08 0460 11    if it were a dream, it was one from which she might
N08 0470 10    never awaken.
N08 0470 12       Facing the forest now, she who had not dared to
N08 0480 10    enter it before, walked between two trees at random
N08 0490  5    and headed in what she believed was the direction of
N08 0500  2    the pool. She remembered little of her previous journey
N08 0500 11    there with Grace, and she could but hope that her dedication
N08 0510 10    to her mission would enable her to accomplish it.
N08 0520  7       The forest was open and freely welcoming, extending
N08 0530  3    an enchanted hand. The ground was covered with soft
N08 0540  2    pine needles and the slope was gentle. Birds chirped
N08 0540 11    and chattered in the trees and the sun, all dewy-eyed
N08 0550 10    and soft, caressed her shoulders warmly from time to
N08 0560  5    time. It was not, thought Pamela, such an evil place
N08 0570  4    after all. No wonder Melissa responded so completely
N08 0570 12    to its beckoning.
N08 0580  3       Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that
N08 0590  2    whispered their secrets above her head as she passed.
N08 0590 11    Was it not possible, after all, that the forest was
N08 0600  8    in league with her and her child ... that its sympathy
N08 0610  6    lay with the Culvers ... that she had erred in failing
N08 0620  3    to understand this?
N08 0620  6       Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along.
N08 0630  5    The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of
N08 0640  2    her heart when she entered the forest was gone now,
N08 0640 12    and even the dim groves of trees through which she
N08 0650  8    occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear. She
N08 0660  4    regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen
N08 0670  2    she sought, and she was glad to at last be doing something
N08 0670 14    positive in her unenunciated, undefined struggle with
N08 0680  7    the mountain and its darkling inhabitants.
N08 0690  3       Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance
N08 0700  2    and denial of the forces that threatened her, Pamela
N08 0700 11    was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking
N08 0710 10    definite steps toward grappling with them. A few days
N08 0720  7    ago, she would have thought such an expedition as this
N08 0730  4    utterly ridiculous; today, on the contrary, it seemed
N08 0740  2    utterly reasonable.
N08 0740  4       She did not pause to consider what she would do
N08 0750  4    if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental
N08 0760  1    and physical energy toward achieving this one goal.
N08 0760  9    If, as she walked, her steps fumbled from time to time,
N08 0770  8    she chose to ignore that omen. If the slope grew steeper
N08 0780  6    and the groves more dim, she tried not to heed. Success
N08 0790  3    depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must
N08 0790 10    be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove
N08 0800 10    to the mountain that she was in earnest.
N08 0810  5       The forest took on an impersonal aspect. It did
N08 0820  3    not care what sort of person prowled its woods, plucked
N08 0820 13    at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes.
N08 0830  9    Unconcerned, indifferent, unmotivated, the forest was
N08 0840  5    simply there- fighting man's depredations with more
N08 0850  3    abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical
N08 0860  1    evening laughter. Red man or white man, pacifist or
N08 0860 10    killer, the forest would accept them all- knowing that
N08 0870  8    it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence;
N08 0880  6    knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the
N08 0890  4    short span of time allotted to any man.
N08 0890 12       Pamela shook her head. She must not think about
N08 0900  9    time. That was another one of those traps.
N08 0910  5       In her grim pursuit of tranquillity, Pamela focused
N08 0920  2    her thoughts on her husband. If, when this was all
N08 0920 12    over, she found the words to tell him about it, she
N08 0930 10    wondered if he would ever understand. How could he
N08 0940  5    comprehend her need when he himself was innocent? Indian
N08 0950  2    ghosts would not impinge upon his nights, nor would
N08 0950 11    his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined, ill-conceived
N08 0960 10    figure of her benighted ancestor. His bright, daylight
N08 0970  6    mind would whistle away such images; they would not
N08 0980  5    dare to face his scoffing.
N08 0980 10       Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near. His presence
N08 0990  8    would have interfered with her duty.
N08 1000  3       The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once
N08 1010  1    or twice on the smooth pine needles. The trees huddled
N08 1010 11    more closely together, their limbs and leaves intertwined
N08 1020  6    in a coarse curtain against the sun. Bushes and vines
N08 1030  6    abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the
N08 1040  1    struggling stranger, and without the direct light of
N08 1040  9    the sun to act as compass, Pamela could no longer be
N08 1050  9    positive of her direction.
N08 1060  1       Nevertheless, she continued to move upward. She
N08 1060  8    was sure she would reach the pool by climbing, and
N08 1070  8    she clung to that belief despite the increasing number
N08 1080  4    of obstacles. The forest had become an alien world
N08 1090  2    where she strove, alone, unprotected, unguided, to
N08 1090  9    deal with whatever hindrances were offered. It was
N08 1100  6    a bold, dark castle of pine boughs that stood like
N08 1110  4    a medieval fortress, eclipsing the sun and human time.
N08 1120  2    At one and the same time, she was within it but still
N08 1120 14    searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry.
N08 1130  9       Silence came into the forest- a solid being that
N08 1140  7    clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds
N08 1150  5    and the whispered comfort of the trees. Silence walked
N08 1160  2    at Pamela's side, its presence numbingly close, yet
N08 1160 10    too far for her to hear. Silence stood in front of
N08 1170 10    her, waiting, and in back of her, blocking her retreat.
N08 1180  6       She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded
N08 1190  4    maliciously above the earth. In spite of her attempt
N08 1200  1    to preserve her balance, she fell, bruising her arm
N08 1200 10    on a naked stone. For a moment, she could not catch
N08 1210  8    her breath and then, her breath returning in short,
N08 1220  4    frightened spasms, she lifted herself to her feet laboriously.
N08 1230  2    She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off
N08 1230 13    her clothes. Her arm bled slightly, and the offended
N08 1240  9    skin cried out in pain.
N08 1250  2       She looked around. She was bewildered. She seemed
N08 1250 10    to have come such a long distance- too far for her
N08 1260 11    destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in
N08 1270  6    the greedy gloom of the trees. She stood quite still,
N08 1280  3    trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn,
N08 1280 13    a path to follow, a clue to guide her.
N08 1290  9       She was standing in a thick grove. The trees were
N08 1300  5    crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped,
N08 1310  2    virtually shutting out the sun completely. The earth
N08 1320  1    smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived
N08 1320 12    of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays. She had
N08 1340  8    the feeling that, under the mouldering leaves, there
N08 1350  3    would be the bodies of dead animals, quietly decaying
N08 1360  1    and giving their soil back to the mountain.
N08 1360  9       The thought made Pamela shudder. A terrible chill
N08 1370  7    swept through the grove. Not a breeze exactly, but
N08 1380  5    a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity
N08 1390  2    upon the deep confines of the grove, catching Pamela
N08 1400  1    in a leering embrace. There was a peculiar density
N08 1400 10    about it, a thick substance that could be sensed but
N08 1410  7    never identified, never actually perceived.
N08 1420  1       Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined
N08 1420 10    such a scene? She already knew this unwholesome, chilling
N08 1430  9    atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive. It enclosed
N08 1440  7    her clammy hands and twined around her ankles. It crept
N08 1450  6    into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her
N08 1460  4    body, seeping into her flesh through all the quivering
N08 1460 13    pores of her skin. It crawled across her breasts, suffocating
N08 1470 10    the life in her nipples. It circled her thighs, exploring
N08 1480  9    with its icy tentacles. It entered her body with the
N08 1490  7    ghastly intimacy of an incubus, and its particles,
N08 1500  3    spreading, creeping, crawling, joined themselves into
N08 1510  1    steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that
N08 1510 10    they ached; stifled her lungs so that her breath came
N08 1520  8    in harsh gasps; clutched her throat and sucked up the
N08 1530  6    moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and
N08 1540  3    hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth
N08 1540 15    were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her
N08 1550  8    jaws.
N08 1550  9       She had to get away from here before this demoniac
N08 1560  8    possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and
N08 1570  5    sank into the fibers of her brain, depriving her of
N08 1580  2    reason and sight. But she did not know which way to
N08 1580 13    go. The shadows of the trees engulfed her, foreclosing
N08 1590  7    every possible exit from the grove. She had been snared
N08 1600  6    here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat
N08 1610  3    in ever-tightening circles.
N08 1610  7       She could not scream, for even if a sound could
N08 1620  7    take shape within her parched mouth, who would hear,
N08 1630  3    who would listen?
N08 1630  6       Does the mountain listen?
N08 1640  1       Pamela groped blindly. She had to escape. She had
N08 1640 10    to move in some direction- any direction that would
N08 1650  7    take her away from this evil place.
N08 1660  2       She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees
N08 1670  1    that resisted her and tried to fling her back. Her
N08 1670 11    own body protested, aching painfully where the blood
N08 1680  6    in her veins had congealed, where cold demon wisps
N08 1690  3    still clung and caressed.
N08 1690  7       Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy.
N08 1700  4    Twigs cracked loudly under her feet; bushes swished
N08 1710  3    and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped
N08 1720  1    as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her.
