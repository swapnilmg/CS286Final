J41 0010  1       Wage-price policies of industry are the result of
J41 0010 10    a complex of forces- no single explanation has been
J41 0020  6    found which applies to all cases. The purpose of this
J41 0030  5    paper is to analyze one possible force which has not
J41 0040  3    been treated in the literature, but which we believe
J41 0040 12    makes a significant contribution to explaining the
J41 0050  6    wage-price behavior of a few very important industries.
J41 0060  4    While there may be several such industries to which
J41 0070  3    the model of this paper is applicable, the authors
J41 0070 12    make particular claim of relevance to the explanation
J41 0080  7    of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry
J41 0090  7    of the United States since World War II. Indeed, the
J41 0100  5    apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the
J41 0110  3    recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms
J41 0110 12    of the model here presented.
J41 0120  4       The model of this paper considers an industry which
J41 0130  2    is not characterized by vigorous price competition,
J41 0130  9    but which is so basic that its wage-price policies
J41 0140 10    are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny.
J41 0150  4    Where the industry's product price has been kept below
J41 0160  5    the "profit-maximizing" and "entry-limiting" prices
J41 0170  2    due to fears of public reaction, the profit seeking
J41 0170 11    producers have an interest in offering little real
J41 0180  8    resistance to wage demands. The contribution of this
J41 0190  5    paper is a demonstration of this proposition, and an
J41 0200  3    exploration of some of its implications.
J41 0200  9       In order to focus clearly upon the operation of
J41 0210  8    this one force, which we may call the effect of "public-limit
J41 0220  6    pricing" on "key" wage bargains, we deliberately simplify
J41 0230  4    the model by abstracting from other forces, such as
J41 0240  3    union power, which may be relevant in an actual situation.
J41 0240 13    For expository purposes, this is best treated as a
J41 0250  9    model which spells out the conditions under which an
J41 0260  7    important industry affected with the public interest
J41 0270  3    would find it profitable to raise wages even in the
J41 0270 13    absence of union pressures for higher wages.
J41 0280  7       Part I below describes this abstract model by
J41 0290  5    spelling out its assumptions. Part II discusses the
J41 0300  3    operation of the model and derives some significant
J41 0310  1    conclusions. Part III discusses the empirical relevance
J41 0310  8    and policy implications of the conclusions. Part IV
J41 0320  7    is a brief summary. The Mathematical Appendix presents
J41 0330  4    the rigorous argument, but is best read after Part
J41 0340  3    I in order that the assumptions underlying the equations
J41 0350  1    may be explicit.
J41 0350  4    #I THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL#
J41 0360  1    _A. THE INDUSTRY_
J41 0360  3       The industry with which this model is concerned
J41 0360 11    is a basic industry, producing a substantial share
J41 0370  7    of gross national product. Price competition is lacking.
J41 0380  5    For the purposes of setting the product price, the
J41 0390  3    industry behaves as a single entity. In wage negotiations,
J41 0400  1    the industry bargains as a unit with a single union.
J41 0410  1    _B. THE DEMAND FOR THE INDUSTRY'S PRODUCT_
J41 0410  5       We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's
J41 0420  5    product. The manner in which this is shared among firms
J41 0430  3    is taken as given. In any given time period, the aggregate
J41 0440  1    demand for the industry's product is determined by
J41 0440  9    two things: the price charged by the industry, and
J41 0450  8    the level of GNP. For the purposes of this discussion,
J41 0460  6    the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these
J41 0470  3    two variables, since GNP includes other prices. (We
J41 0480  2    abstract here from technological progress and assume
J41 0480  9    that prices of all other products change proportionately.)
J41 0490  7       The form of the industry demand function is one
J41 0500  7    which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the
J41 0510  4    product price, and vary directly with the level of
J41 0520  1    GNP.
J41 0520  2    _C. INDUSTRY PRODUCT PRICE POLICY_
J41 0520  7       The industry of this model is so important that
J41 0530  7    its wage and price policies are affected with a public
J41 0540  4    interest. Because of its importance, and because the
J41 0550  1    lack of price competition is well recognized, the industry
J41 0550 10    is under considerable public pressure not to raise
J41 0560  6    its price any more than could be justified by cost
J41 0570  5    increases. The threat of effective anti-trust action,
J41 0580  1    provoked by "gouging the public" through price increases
J41 0580  9    not justified by cost increases, and fears of endangering
J41 0590  9    relations with customers, Congress, the general public
J41 0600  6    and the press, all operate to keep price increases
J41 0610  5    in some relation to cost increases. For the industry
J41 0620  2    of this model, the effect of such public pressures
J41 0620 11    in the past has been to hold the price well below the
J41 0630 11    short-run profit-maximizing price (given the wage rate
J41 0640  6    and the level of GNP), and even below the entry-limited
J41 0650  5    price (but not below average cost).
J41 0650 11       For such an industry, it is only "safe" to raise
J41 0660 10    its price if such an increase is manifestly "justified"
J41 0670  5    by rising costs (due to rising wages, etc.). Thus,
J41 0680  4    if public pressure sets the effective limit to the
J41 0690  2    price that the industry may charge, this pressure is
J41 0690 11    itself a function of the wage rate. In this model,
J41 0700  8    we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes,
J41 0710  5    so that the "public-limit price" only rises as the
J41 0720  4    wage rate rises. In such circumstances, it may well
J41 0720 13    be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase
J41 0730 11    in the basic wage rate.
J41 0740  2       Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises,
J41 0740 11    the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit
J41 0750 10    price is elevated, and is likely to remain well above
J41 0760  8    the latter. The entry-limiting price will also be raised
J41 0770  6    for potential domestic competition, but unless general
J41 0780  3    inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately
J41 0790  1    throughout the economy, we might expect the public-limit
J41 0790 10    price to approach the entry-limit price. The foreign-entry-limit
J41 0800 11    price would be approached more rapidly, since domestic
J41 0810  7    wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly. Where
J41 0820  4    this approach becomes critical, the industry can be
J41 0830  3    expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of
J41 0830 13    its sincerity in "resisting" the wage pressures of
J41 0840  8    a powerful union, requesting tariff relief after it
J41 0850  5    has "reluctantly" acceded to the union pressure.
J41 0860  2       Whether or not it is in the industry's interest
J41 0870  1    to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends
J41 0870 11    upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises
J41 0880  8    in response to a basic wage increase, and the relation
J41 0890  5    of this response to the increase in costs accompanying
J41 0900  1    the wage increase. The extent to which the public-limit
J41 0900 11    price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage
J41 0910 11    rate is itself a function of three things: the passage
J41 0920  7    of time, the level of GNP, and the size of the wage
J41 0930  7    increase.
J41 0930  8       We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here,
J41 0940  6    but it should be obvious that the extent to which the
J41 0950  3    public-limit price is raised by a given increase in
J41 0950 13    the basic wage rate is also a function of the show
J41 0960 10    of resistance put up by the industry. The industry
J41 0970  4    may deliberately take a strike, not to put pressure
J41 0980  1    on the union, but in order to "educate" the government
J41 0980 11    and the customers of the industry. As a strike continues,
J41 0990 10    these parties increase their pressure on the industry
J41 1000  6    to reach an agreement. They become increasingly willing
J41 1010  3    to accept the price increase that the industry claims
J41 1020  2    the wage bargain would entail.
J41 1020  7       Public indignation and resistance to wage-price
J41 1030  5    increases is obviously much less when the increases
J41 1040  1    are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases
J41 1040 13    are on the order of 3% per month. The simple passage
J41 1050 11    of an additional eleven months' time makes the second
J41 1060  7    3% boost more acceptable. Thus, the public-limit price
J41 1070  5    is raised further by a given wage increase the longer
J41 1080  3    it has been since the previous price increase. Notice,
J41 1080 12    however, that the passage of time does not permit the
J41 1090 10    raising of prices per se, without an accompanying wage
J41 1100  7    increase. Similarly, higher levels of GNP do not,
J41 1110  6    in themselves, provide grounds for raising prices,
J41 1120  2    but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry
J41 1120 13    so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage
J41 1130 10    increase. This is not extended to anticipated levels
J41 1140  5    of GNP, however- only the current level of GNP affects
J41 1150  5    the public pressure against wage-price increases. Finally,
J41 1160  2    since the public requires some restraint on the part
J41 1170  1    of the companies, larger wage increases call for less
J41 1170 10    than proportionately larger price increases (e.g.,
J41 1180  5    if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of
J41 1190  5    7%, a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase
J41 1200  2    of something less than 14%).
J41 1200  7    _D. INDUSTRY COSTS_
J41 1200 10       We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant
J41 1210 10    region of operation is constant with respect to quantity
J41 1220  7    produced (the average cost curve is horizontal, and
J41 1230  4    therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve),
J41 1240  1    and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the
J41 1240 12    industry). The level of this average cost is determined
J41 1250  9    by factor prices, technology, and so forth. As we have
J41 1260  7    noted, however, we are abstracting from changes in
J41 1270  4    all determinants of this level except for changes in
J41 1280  1    the wage rate. The level of average cost (equal to
J41 1280 11    marginal cost) is thus strictly a function of the wage
J41 1290  8    rate.
J41 1300  1    _E. UNION POLICIES AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES_
J41 1300  3       The single union which faces the industry does not
J41 1310  3    restrict its membership, and there is an adequate supply
J41 1320  1    of labor available to the firms of the industry at
J41 1320 11    the going wage rate. The union does not regard unemployment
J41 1330  7    of its own members as a matter of concern when setting
J41 1340  5    its own wage policy- its concern with employment makes
J41 1350  2    itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain
J41 1360  1    full employment.
J41 1360  3       The union vigorously demands wage increases from
J41 1370  1    productivity increases, and wage increases to offset
J41 1370  8    cost-of-living increases, but we abstract from these
J41 1380  7    forces here. For our present purposes we assume that
J41 1390  5    the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate
J41 1400  2    (not including productivity improvement factors or
J41 1400  8    cost-of-living adjustments), and it is this basic wage
J41 1410  8    rate which determines the level of costs. Productivity
J41 1420  5    is something of an amorphous concept and the amount
J41 1430  3    of productivity increase in a given time period is
J41 1430 12    not even well known to the industry, much less to the
J41 1440 10    union or to the public. Disagreement on the amount
J41 1450  5    of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of
J41 1460  3    agreeing how an increase in profit margins related
J41 1460 11    to a productivity increase should be shared. The existence
J41 1470  7    of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase
J41 1480  7    in money wages does not contradict the assumption that
J41 1490  4    the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and
J41 1500  2    productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising
J41 1500 11    increase in the basic wage rate.
J41 1510  6       We assume further that the union recognizes the
J41 1520  3    possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate
J41 1530  1    increases, and it does not entirely disregard the effect
J41 1530 10    of price increases arising from its own wage increases
J41 1540  8    upon the "real" wage rate. For internal political reasons,
J41 1550  7    the union asks for (and accepts) increases in the basic
J41 1560  5    wage rate, and would vigorously oppose a reduction
J41 1570  3    in this rate, but the adjustment of the basic wage
J41 1570 13    rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of
J41 1580  9    the companies of the industry.
J41 1590  1       Changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising,
J41 1590 10    and they constitute an argument for raising prices.
J41 1600  8    However, it is not known to either the union or the
J41 1610  7    public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused
J41 1620  3    by a given change in the basic wage rate, although
J41 1620 13    the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates
J41 1630  8    of this magnitude.
J41 1640  1       In this model, then, the industry is presumed to
J41 1640 10    realize that they could successfully resist a change
J41 1650  7    in the basic wage rate, but since such a change is
J41 1660  5    the only effective means to raising prices they may,
J41 1670  1    in circumstances to be spelled out in Part II below,
J41 1670 11    find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise.
J41 1680  8    Thus, for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate,
J41 1690  6    the industry becomes the active wage-setter, since
J41 1700  2    any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only
J41 1700 12    by reason of industry acquiescence. The presumption
J41 1710  6    in the literature would appear to be that the basic
J41 1720  6    wage rate would be unchanged in this case, on the grounds
J41 1730  3    that it is "clearly" not in the interest of the industry
J41 1740  1    to raise wages gratuitously. From this presumption
J41 1740  8    it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed
J41 1750  8    increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union
J41 1760  6    behavior different and more aggressive than assumed
J41 1770  1    in our model. It is this conclusion that we challenge;
J41 1770 11    we do so by disproving the presumption on which it
J41 1780  9    is based.
J41 1780 11    #II THE OPERATION OF THE MODEL#
J41 1790  4    It is convenient to assume that the union-industry
J41 1800  1    contract is of one year's duration.
