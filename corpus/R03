R03 0010  1       Needless to say, I was furious at this unparalleled
R03 0010 10    intrusion upon free enterprise. How dared they demand
R03 0020  8    to "snoop" in private financial records, disbursements,
R03 0030  4    confidential contracts and agreements? "It is as though",
R03 0040  5    I said on the historic three-hour, coast-to-coast radio
R03 0050  2    broadcast which I bought (following Father Coughlin
R03 0060  1    and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor, Manhattan Merry-go-round
R03 0060 11    and Major Bowes shows) "That Man in the White House,
R03 0070 10    like some despot of yore, insisted on reading my diary,
R03 0080  8    raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie!" My impassioned
R03 0090  5    plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence
R03 0100  5    and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing
R03 0110  2    the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.
R03 0110 11    But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect
R03 0120  9    from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close
R03 0130 10    all of the banks in our great nation? The savage barbarian
R03 0140  5    hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens
R03 0150  4    that was mighty Metronome, sacking and despoiling with
R03 0160  2    their Bolshevistic battle cry of "Soak the rich'! After
R03 0170  1    an unspeakable siege, lasting the better part of two
R03 0170 10    months, it was announced that the studio "owed" the
R03 0180  7    government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars
R03 0190  5    while I, who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous
R03 0200  3    practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned
R03 0210  1    and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless
R03 0210 10    relict, was "stung" with a personal bill of such astronomical
R03 0220 10    proportions as to "wipe out" all but a fraction of
R03 0230 10    my poor, hard-come-by savings. I was also publicly
R03 0240  5    reprimanded, dragged through the mud by the radical
R03 0250  2    press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications
R03 0250 13    as The New Republic, The New Yorker, Time and the Christian
R03 0270  1    Science Monitor.
R03 0270  3       It was then that I availed myself of the rights
R03 0280  2    of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional.
R03 0280 11    The litigation was costly and seemingly endless. I
R03 0290  8    fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my
R03 0300  8    case to the Supreme Court (1937), Mr. Roosevelt and
R03 0310  4    his "henchmen" had done their "dirty work" all too
R03 0320  3    well, even going so far as to attempt to "pack" the
R03 0320 14    highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little
R03 0330 10    me. Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in
R03 0340  7    poisoning the courtiers, "toadies" and sycophants of
R03 0350  4    the "bench" against me, but it had been so far-reaching
R03 0360  1    as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing
R03 0370  1    me! I was ready, like Portia, to present my own brief.
R03 0370 12    But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case! My
R03 0380  9    plea was unanimously voted down and "thrown out". Again,
R03 0390  7    my name was on all the front pages. I was, it seemed,
R03 0400  7    persona non grata in every quarter, but not entirely
R03 0410  4    without a staunch following of noted political thinkers
R03 0420  1    and students of jurisprudence. As Charles Evans Hughes
R03 0420  9    said, "Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are
R03 0430  8    exceeded only by her logic as a litigant". Albert Einstein
R03 0440  8    was quoted as saying: "The workings of the woman's
R03 0450  6    mind amaze me". Henry Ford spoke of me as "utterly
R03 0460  5    astounding". Heywood Broun wrote: "Belle Poitrine is
R03 0470  3    the most original thinker since Caligula", and even
R03 0480  1    F.D.R. had to concede that "if the rest of this nation
R03 0480 12    showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine,
R03 0490  8    America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and
R03 0500  5    Nineveh".
R03 0500  6       Not only were the court costs prohibitive, but I
R03 0510  7    was subjected to crippling fines, in addition to usurious
R03 0520  5    interest on the unpaid "debts" which the governmen
R03 0530  1    claimed that Metronome and I owed- a severe financial
R03 0530 10    blow. Nor, as Manny said, had the notoriety done my
R03 0540 10    career "any good". My enemies were only too anxious
R03 0550  7    to level against me such charges as "reactionary",
R03 0560  3    "robber baroness", and even "traitor"! Traitor indeed!
R03 0570  3    I point now with pride to the fact that, long ere the
R03 0580  2    Committee on Un-American Activities, the Minute Women,
R03 0580 10    the Economic Council and other such notable "watchdog"
R03 0590  8    organizations were so much as heard of, I was Hollywood's
R03 0600 10    leading bulwark against communism, fighting single-handedly
R03 0610  5    "creeping socialism" against such insuperable odds
R03 0620  4    as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA, PWA, WPA,
R03 0630  3    CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries
R03 0640  3    whom F.D.R. employed secretly, through the transparent
R03 0650  3    ruse of regular "relief" checks.
R03 0650  8       Needless to say, my art suffered drastically during
R03 0660  8    this turbulent period. Could it do otherwise? Even
R03 0670  5    though I have always had a genius for "throwing myself"
R03 0680  3    into every role and "playing it for all it's worth",
R03 0690  2    no actress can be expected to do her best work when
R03 0690 13    her fortune, her reputation, her livelihood, her home
R03 0700  7    and her nation itself are all imperilled. Such sweeping
R03 0710  5    distractions are hardly conducive to "Oscar" winning
R03 0720  3    performances. I tried my hardest, with little help,
R03 0730  1    may I say, from my husband and leading man, but somehow
R03 0730 12    the outside pressures were too severe.
R03 0740  5       Having (through my unflagging effort and devotion)
R03 0750  4    achieved stardom, a fortune and a world-renowned wife
R03 0760  2    at an age when most young men are casting their first
R03 0760 13    vote, Letch proceeded to neglect them all. Never a
R03 0770  8    "quick study", he now made no attempt to learn his
R03 0780  7    "lines" and many a mile of film was wasted, many a
R03 0790  4    scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow
R03 0800  1    thespians- was taken thirty, forty, fifty times because
R03 0800  8    Miss Poitrine's co-star and "helpmate" had never learned
R03 0810  8    his part. Each time Letch "went up" in his "lines",
R03 0820  8    I was the one to be patient, helpful and apologetic
R03 0830  6    while he indulged in outbursts of temperament, profanity
R03 0840  4    and abuse, blaming others, going into "sulks" and,
R03 0850  2    on more occasions than I care to count, storming off
R03 0850 12    the "set" for the rest of the day. As for his finances,
R03 0860 11    I was never privileged to know exactly how much money
R03 0870  7    Letch had "salted away". It was I who paid for our
R03 0880  8    little home, the food, the liquor, the servants- even
R03 0890  4    Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic
R03 0900  1    Club. Never once did he buy me a single gift and for
R03 0900 13    our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw.
R03 0910  8    (But that is another story.) As for his private monies,
R03 0920  6    they were rapidly dissipated in drinking, gaming and
R03 0930  3    carousing. More than once I was confronted by professional
R03 0940  1    gamblers, "bookies", loan "sharks", gangsters, "thugs"
R03 0950  1    and "finger men"- people of a class I did not even
R03 0950 12    know existed- to repay my husband's staggering losses,
R03 0960  9    "or else ..." I shuddered to think that someone so
R03 0970  7    dear to me could even associate with such a sinister
R03 0980  4    milieu. And at three different times during our turbulent
R03 0990  2    marriage strange girls, with the commonest of accents,
R03 0990 10    telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their
R03 1000 10    unborn children! Having the deepest of maternal instincts,
R03 1010  7    my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling
R03 1020  6    pink and white "bundles from heaven" I would have proudly
R03 1030  4    given my husband. "Ah, you're too old", was invariably
R03 1040  2    his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested
R03 1040 10    "starting a family". Letch had made it abundantly clear
R03 1050  9    that he did not care for the company of my own precious
R03 1060 10    daughter. I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in
R03 1070  6    school and- during the summers- at a camp run by the
R03 1080  4    Society of Friends all year around. Her presence only
R03 1090  1    made Letch more distant and irritable and, in the hurry
R03 1090 11    of buying Chateau Belletch, I had neglected to consider
R03 1100  7    a room for Baby-dear, so there was no place to put
R03 1110  8    her, anyhow. (I sometimes feel that God, in His infinite
R03 1120  4    wisdom, wants us to have these inexplicable little
R03 1130  1    lapses of memory. It almost always works out for the
R03 1130 11    best.)
R03 1140  1       Yet I adored this man, Letch Feeley, why, I cannot
R03 1140 11    say. With faint heart and a brave smile, I endured
R03 1150  8    his long absences from Chateau Belletch, his coldness,
R03 1160  4    his indifference, his slights and his abuse. The times
R03 1170  3    I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him-
R03 1170 13    lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the
R03 1180  9    collation was postponed and postponed and postponed,
R03 1190  5    only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where
R03 1200  5    the host's chair was vacant; a "splash party" at the
R03 1210  3    new pool, which I had built in the hope of keeping
R03 1210 14    Letch away from public beaches, when Letch and a certain
R03 1220 10    Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better
R03 1230  6    part of an hour; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's,
R03 1240  5    on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown
R03 1250  5    "starlet", leaving me "high and dry" to get home as
R03 1260  4    best I could. These are but a sampling of the insults
R03 1260 15    I endured. As Mrs. Letch Feeley, was it any wonder
R03 1270 10    that I, once the social arbiter of Filmdom, was excluded
R03 1280  8    from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires,
R03 1290  5    the Coopers, the Gables, the Colmans, the Rathbones,
R03 1300  3    the Taylors, the Thalbergs and such devout, closely
R03 1310  1    knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys? As
R03 1310 10    Letch's antisocial conduct increased, our invitations
R03 1320  6    decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played
R03 1330  8    hostess at a fashionable "screenland" gathering.
R03 1340  2       Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films
R03 1350  2    together, each less successful, both artistically and
R03 1350  9    commercially, than the one before it. Our last joint
R03 1360  9    venture, Sainted Lady, a deeply religious film based
R03 1370  6    on the life of Mother Cabrini, and timed so that its
R03 1380  5    release date would coincide with the beatification
R03 1390  1    of America's first saint in November, 1938, was a fiasco
R03 1390 11    from start to finish. As I was playing Mother Cabrini,
R03 1400  9    the picture was actually "all mine", with nearly every
R03 1410  6    scene built around me. But in order to keep Letch in
R03 1420  6    the public eye and out of trouble, I wrote in a part
R03 1430  4    especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who "sees
R03 1440  1    the light" and is saved by the inspiring example of
R03 1440 11    Mother Cabrini. And did he appreciate my efforts on
R03 1450  8    his behalf? Did he trouble to memorize the very small
R03 1460  5    part which I had "tailor-made" to his specifications,
R03 1470  1    a role eventually cut down to three short speeches?
R03 1470 10    Did he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand-
R03 1480 11    the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually-
R03 1490  7    or even at all? He did not! The "shooting" went on
R03 1500  7    for eight months! Most of our working days were spent
R03 1510  7    on the telephone calling "bookies", illegal gambling
R03 1520  3    dens, a certain "residential club for young actresses",
R03 1530  1    more than a hundred different bars or the steam room
R03 1530 11    of the athletic club. Whenever he deigned to appear
R03 1540  8    at the studio he was "hung over", uncooperative, rude
R03 1550  4    and insulting. He made many tasteless, irreverent and
R03 1560  3    unfunny remarks, not only about me in the title role,
R03 1570  2    but about religion in general. By the time the film
R03 1570 12    was released we were three million dollars over-spent,
R03 1580  8    war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten
R03 1590  5    all about Mother Cabrini. Thanks to Letch Feeley and
R03 1600  4    the terrible strain he imposed on me, the notices were
R03 1610  2    few and unfavorable. Only George Santayana seemed to
R03 1610 10    understand and appreciate the film when he wrote: "Miss
R03 1620  9    Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument
R03 1630  5    for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood".
R03 1640  3    But it was small consolation.
R03 1640  8       In a rare fit of anger and spite, I "farmed out"
R03 1650  9    my own husband to a small and most undistinguished
R03 1660  4    studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.
R03 1670  1    (An actor must have discipline.) The film was called
R03 1670 10    The Diet of Worms, which I felt was just what Letch
R03 1680 11    deserved. It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther,
R03 1690 10    of all things! It was a disaster! In clothes, Letch
R03 1700  6    simply did not project. He was laughed off the screen.
R03 1710  4    At the same time, however, I availed myself of the
R03 1720  1    services of that great English actor and master of
R03 1720 10    make-up, Sir Gauntley Pratt, to do a "quickie" called
R03 1730  7    The Mystery of the Mad Marquess, in which I played
R03 1740  6    a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle
R03 1750  4    on the English moors which is filled with secret passages
R03 1760  1    and sliding panels and, unbeknownst to anyone, is still
R03 1760 10    occupied by an eccentric maniac. It was a "potboiler"
R03 1770  9    made on a "shoestring" and not the sort of film I like,
R03 1780  9    as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great
R03 1790  6    deal. My heart was not in it, but, oddly enough, it
R03 1800  3    remains the most financially successful picture of
R03 1800 10    my career. (I watched it on television late one night
R03 1810  9    last week and it "stands up" remarkably well, even
R03 1820  5    twenty years later.)
R03 1820  8       Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant
R03 1830  6    and more badly behaved than before. I really loved
R03 1840  5    that boy, and, in a feverish attempt to preserve our
R03 1850  2    marriage and to try to revive the wonderful, wonderful
R03 1850 11    person Letch had once been, I took my troubles to Momma,
R03 1860 11    hoping that her earthy advice would help me.
R03 1870  5       "If I could only think of something at the studio,
R03 1880  4    near me, to absorb his boundless energy", I said. "What
R03 1890  2    is Letch interested in"?
R03 1890  6       "Bookies, booze and babes", Momma said bluntly.
R03 1900  5       Her reply stung me, but this was too important to
R03 1910  5    let my hurt make any difference. "I can't turn the
R03 1920  2    studio into a gambling hell or a saloon", I said.
