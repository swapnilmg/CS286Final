A36 0010  1    SEN. JOHN L. McCLELLAN of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin
A36 0020  2    of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the
A36 0020 12    unions under the anti-monopoly laws. Once more the
A36 0030  9    fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since
A36 0040  5    business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws,
A36 0050  2    there must be a corresponding restriction against labor
A36 0050 10    unions: the law must treat everybody equally. Or, in
A36 0060  9    the words of Anatole France, "The law in its majestic
A36 0070  7    equality must forbid the rich, as well as the poor,
A36 0080  6    from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges".
A36 0090  2       The public atmosphere that has been generated which
A36 0100  1    makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from
A36 0100 10    the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen
A36 0110  8    as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption
A36 0120  4    in labor-management relations and, later, into the
A36 0130  3    jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations
A36 0140  1    at the missile sites. The Senator was shocked by stoppages
A36 0140 11    over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile
A36 0150  8    program. In addition, disclosures that missile workers
A36 0160  5    were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for
A36 0170  6    equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation
A36 0180  1    on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing
A36 0180 10    the bill.
A36 0190  1       It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays
A36 0190 11    for high wages, but he pays the employers' strike expenses
A36 0200  7    when the latter undertakes to fight a strike. Business
A36 0210  6    Week (Aug. 9, 1961) reports that the United Aircraft
A36 0220  4    Company, against which the International Association
A36 0230  1    of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep
A36 0230 10    its plants operating. The company incurred some $10
A36 0240  7    million of expenses attributable to four factors: advertising
A36 0250  5    to attract new employees, hiring and training them,
A36 0260  4    extra overtime, and defective work performed by the
A36 0270  2    new workers. The company has billed the United States
A36 0270 11    Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the
A36 0280  8    Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type
A36 0290  6    generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for
A36 0300  3    the conduct of the contractor's business.
A36 0300  9       Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this
A36 0310  8    problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee.
A36 0320  7    The committee remains unresponsive. Neither has Congressman
A36 0330  4    Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the
A36 0340  6    matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses
A36 0350  2    by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.
A36 0350 11    ##
A36 0350 12    THE RECENT publicity attending the successful federal
A36 0360  7    prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number
A36 0370  8    of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect
A36 0380  6    for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by
A36 0390  3    their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.
A36 0390 12    The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must
A36 0400 10    compete, but along completely undefined lines; it must
A36 0410  5    play a game in which there never is a winner. The fact
A36 0420  5    is that any business that wants to operate successfully
A36 0430  1    cannot follow the law. Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer
A36 0430 10    to a foolish public policy.
A36 0440  4       Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry
A36 0450  2    in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number
A36 0450 10    of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging
A36 0460  8    in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market.
A36 0470  8    The industry is so structured that price-setting by
A36 0480  5    a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead
A36 0490  2    charges are allocated- whether marginal or average
A36 0490  9    pricing is applied.
A36 0500  3       The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise
A36 0510  1    is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of
A36 0510 11    other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.
A36 0520  8    Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale
A36 0530  8    for almost any price. Naturally, enterprises of the
A36 0540  4    size of General Electric are in a position to structure
A36 0550  2    their prices in such a way that the relatively small
A36 0550 12    competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short
A36 0560 11    time. Should these giants really flex their competitive
A36 0570  5    muscles, they would become the only survivors in the
A36 0580  4    industry. Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating
A36 0590  1    a monopoly by "unfair competition". But if they show
A36 0590 10    self-restraint, they don't get the orders.
A36 0600  6       Under the circumstances, the only protection for
A36 0610  5    the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in
A36 0620  2    exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for
A36 0620 11    which the latter were convicted. Engaging in such a
A36 0630  7    conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants. The paradox
A36 0640  6    implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand
A36 0650  3    of the government, after the conviction, that General
A36 0650 11    Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would
A36 0660 10    not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with
A36 0670  8    its fellows. In other words, the anti-trust laws, designed
A36 0680  6    to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday, Wednesday
A36 0690  2    and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer
A36 0700  1    on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. And which theory
A36 0700  9    would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday?
A36 0710  9    ##
A36 0710 10    THE QUESTION might be asked: "Don't the managements
A36 0720  7    of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these
A36 0730  4    facts? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas,
A36 0740  5    throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be
A36 0750  3    good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence
A36 0750 10    in the laws"?
A36 0760  3       The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management
A36 0770  2    was explained by Thurman Arnold, in The Folklore of
A36 0770 11    Capitalism, back in 1937. He wrote: "(P. 211) ... the
A36 0780 10    anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which
A36 0790  9    unconsciously felt the need of great organizations,
A36 0800  4    and at the same time had to deny them a place in the
A36 0810  3    moral and logical ideology of the social structure.
A36 0810 11    (P. 214) ... anti-trust laws became the greatest protection
A36 0820  9    to uncontrolled business dictatorship. (P. 215) ...
A36 0830  6    when corporate abuses were attacked, it was done on
A36 0840  5    the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked
A36 0850  1    rather than control. ... In this manner, every scheme
A36 0850 10    for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective
A36 0860  9    rock of the anti-trust laws. (Pp. 228-229) ... in any
A36 0870  8    event, it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not
A36 0880  4    prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial
A36 0890  1    empires the world has ever known, held together by
A36 0890 10    some of the most fantastic ideas, all based on the
A36 0900  7    fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual
A36 0910  4    who can trade and exchange goods without control by
A36 0920  2    the government".
A36 0920  4       This escape from control has led to management's
A36 0930  1    evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution
A36 0930  8    as worth while. A plea of nolo contendere, followed
A36 0940  9    by a nominal fine, after all is a small price to pay
A36 0950  9    for this untrammeled license. (The penalties handed
A36 0960  3    out in the electrical case, which included jail sentences,
A36 0970  2    were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps
A36 0970  9    because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness
A36 0980  7    in their pricing activities.)
A36 0990  2       If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control
A36 1000  1    of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously
A36 1000  8    some method must be devised for representing the public
A36 1010  7    interest. A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly
A36 1020  5    such a vehicle. However, one can argue that no such
A36 1030  3    control is necessary as long as one pretends that the
A36 1030 13    anti-trust laws are effective and rational. Quite clearly
A36 1040  8    the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational-
A36 1050  6    and yet the argument goes that they should be extended
A36 1060  5    to the labor union.
A36 1060  9       THOSE WHO favor placing trade unions under anti-trust
A36 1070  8    laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform.
A36 1080  5       Before 1933, individuals who opposed trade unions
A36 1090  3    and collective bargaining said so in plain English.
A36 1100  1    The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national
A36 1100  9    policy in 1934, implicit in the writing of Section
A36 1110  7    7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act, has made
A36 1120  5    it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle.
A36 1130  3    The Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin
A36 1140  1    Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.
A36 1150  1       The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining
A36 1150  9    system is the removal of wages from competition. If
A36 1160  9    a union cannot perform this function, then collective
A36 1170  5    bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic
A36 1180  4    fraud.
A36 1180  5       The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their
A36 1190  5    ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply
A36 1200  1    and price of labor is one of the things that create
A36 1200 12    a legal profession. The problem must be faced squarely.
A36 1210  7    If laborers are merely commodities competing against
A36 1220  3    each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat
A36 1230  3    and corn (unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural
A36 1230 12    subsidy), then they may be pardoned for reacting with
A36 1240  9    complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status
A36 1250  8    upon them.
A36 1250 10       Human labor was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth-
A36 1260  9    and nineteenth-century America. As early as 1776, Adam
A36 1270  7    Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations: "We have no acts
A36 1280  6    of Parliament against combining to lower the price
A36 1290  5    of work; but many against combining to raise it".
A36 1300  1    Eighteenth-century
A36 1300  3    England, upon whose customs our common law was built,
A36 1310  2    had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.
A36 1310  9    In 1825, the Boston house carpenters' strike for a
A36 1320  8    ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers,
A36 1330  5    who declared: "It is ... considered that all combinations
A36 1340  4    by any classes of citizens intended to ... effect the
A36 1350  2    value of labor ... tend to convert all its branches
A36 1350 12    into monopolies".
A36 1360  1       There were no pious hypocrisies then about being
A36 1360  9    for collective bargaining, but against labor monopoly.
A36 1370  7    The courts shared the opinion of the employers. In
A36 1380  8    People vs. Fisher, Justice Savage of the New York Supreme
A36 1390  7    Court declared:
A36 1400  1       "Without any officious and improper interference
A36 1400  6    on the subject, the price of labor or the wages of
A36 1410  8    mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured
A36 1420  4    article and the value of that which is paid for it;
A36 1430  3    but the right does not exist to raise ... the wages
A36 1430 14    of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means".
A36 1440  7       Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge
A36 1450  6    with how Congressman Martin, according to the Daily
A36 1460  4    Labor Report of Sept. 19, 1961, defends the necessity
A36 1470  3    of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of
A36 1470 12    labor "if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of
A36 1480  9    wages, production or prices and if we wish to preserve
A36 1490  8    the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract
A36 1500  4    on wages, hours and conditions of employment".
A36 1510  1       Senator McClellan is proposing the application of
A36 1510  8    anti-trust measures to unions in transportation. His
A36 1520  7    bill, allegedly aimed at Hoffa, would amend the Sherman,
A36 1530  6    Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the
A36 1540  4    issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation
A36 1550  1    strike and would make it illegal for any union to act
A36 1550 12    in concert with any other union- even a sister local
A36 1560  9    in the same international.
A36 1570  1       Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan
A36 1570  9    was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor
A36 1580 10    in transportation, the Civil Aeronautics Board was
A36 1590  6    assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to
A36 1600  5    eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action
A36 1610  1    would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.
A36 1610 12    Indeed, it is in the field of transportation that Congress
A36 1620  9    has most frequently granted employers exemption from
A36 1630  5    the anti-trust laws; for example, the organization
A36 1640  3    of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the
A36 1650  1    encouragement of railroads to seek mergers. At the
A36 1650  9    very moment that every attempt is being made to take
A36 1660  8    management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust
A36 1670  4    legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining
A36 1680  2    under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws
A36 1680 11    to unions who want no more than to continue to set
A36 1690 10    wages in the same way that ship operators set freight
A36 1700  5    rates.
A36 1700  6    ##
A36 1700  7    THE passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies.
A36 1710  8    It was most effective against trade unions. In the
A36 1720  5    famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was brought against
A36 1730  3    the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices,
A36 1740  1    e.g., trying to persuade consumers not to purchase
A36 1740  9    the product of the struck manufacturer. The suit against
A36 1750  8    the union was successful and many workers lost their
A36 1760  6    homes to pay off the judgment.
A36 1770  1       In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor
A36 1770 10    out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating
A36 1780  7    that human labor was not to be considered a commodity.
A36 1790  4    The law could not suspend economics. Labor remained
A36 1800  1    a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted
A36 1800  9    immunization from the anti-trust laws.
A36 1810  6       The courts, by interpretation, emasculated the act.
A36 1820  4    In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado
A36 1830  2    Coal Company. The company sued under the anti-trust
A36 1830 11    laws, alleging that the union's activity interfered
A36 1840  7    with the movement of interstate commerce. (What other
A36 1850  5    purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt
A36 1860  4    the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?) The
A36 1870  1    court first ruled that the strike constituted only
A36 1870  9    an indirect interference with commerce.
