G59 0010  1    For by now the original cause of the quarrel, Philip's
G59 0010 11    seizure of Gascony, was only one strand in the spider
G59 0020  9    web of French interests that overlay all western Europe
G59 0030  5    and that had been so well and closely spun that the
G59 0040  4    lightest movement could set it trembling from one end
G59 0040 13    to the other. Even so, Edward's ambassadors can scarcely
G59 0050  9    have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay
G59 0060  8    ahead of them before peace was finally made and that
G59 0070  6    when it did come the countless embassies that left
G59 0080  2    England for Rome during that period had very little
G59 0080 11    to do with it.
G59 0090  2       It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their
G59 0090 14    failures on the pope. Nogaret is hardly an impartial
G59 0100  9    witness, and even he did not make his charges against
G59 0120  6    Boniface until the latter was dead, but there is some
G59 0130  4    truth in what he said and more in what he did not say.
G59 0140  1    It was not merely a hunger for "money, gold and precious
G59 0140 12    objects" that delayed the papal pronouncement that
G59 0150  7    could have brought the war to an end; the pope was
G59 0170  7    playing a dangerous game, with so many balls in the
G59 0180  3    air at once that a misstep would bring them all about
G59 0180 14    his ears, and his only hope was to temporize so that
G59 0190 10    he could take advantage of every change in the delicate
G59 0200  7    balance of European affairs. When the negotiations
G59 0210  2    began, his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily
G59 0220  1    in abeyance, and he had no intention of reviving it
G59 0220 11    so long as there was hope that French money would come
G59 0230  8    to pay the troops who, under Charles of Valois, the
G59 0250  2    papal vicar of Tuscany, were so valuable in the crusade
G59 0260  3    against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies.
G59 0270  1    If his circumspection in regard to Philip's sensibilities
G59 0270  9    went so far that he even refused to grant a dispensation
G59 0280 10    for the marriage of Amadee's daughter, Agnes, to the
G59 0290  6    son of the dauphin of Vienne- a truly peacemaking move
G59 0300  5    according to thirteenth-century ideas, for Savoy and
G59 0310  2    Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides-
G59 0310 10    for fear that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French
G59 0320 11    coalition, he would certainly never take the far more
G59 0330  7    drastic step of ordering the return of Gascony to Edward,
G59 0340  5    even though, as he admitted to the English ambassadors,
G59 0350  2    he had been advised that the original cession was invalid.
G59 0360  1    On the other hand, he did not want to offend Edward
G59 0360 12    either, and he found himself in a very difficult position.
G59 0370  9    On the surface, the whole question was purely feudal.
G59 0380  5    The French were now occupying Gascony and Flanders
G59 0390  3    on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited
G59 0400  1    them by a breach of the feudal contract. But Edward
G59 0400 11    was invading Scotland for precisely the same reason,
G59 0410  7    and his insubordinate vassal was the ally of the king
G59 0420  7    of France. Boniface had to uphold the sacredness of
G59 0430  2    the feudal contract at all costs, for it was only as
G59 0430 13    suzerain of Sicily and of the Patrimony of Peter that
G59 0440 10    he had any justification for his Italian wars, but
G59 0450  6    in the English-Scottish-French triangle it was almost
G59 0460  4    impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one
G59 0470  1    of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those
G59 0470  9    of the other two.
G59 0480  2       Because of these involvements in the matter at stake,
G59 0480 11    Boniface lacked the impartiality that is supposed to
G59 0490  8    be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter,
G59 0495  6    and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient
G59 0510  2    reason why the English embassies to the Curia proved
G59 0520  1    so fruitless. But when the situation was so complicated
G59 0520 10    that even Nogaret, one of the principal actors in the
G59 0530  9    drama, could misinterpret the pope's motives, it is
G59 0540  6    possible that Othon and his companions, equally baffled,
G59 0550  3    attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause.
G59 0560  1    This was Boniface's monumental tactlessness. "Tact",
G59 0560  7    by its very derivation, implies that its possessor
G59 0570  8    keeps in touch with other people, but the author of
G59 0580  6    Clericis Laicos and Unam Sanctam, the wielder of the
G59 0590  5    two swords, the papal sun of which the imperial moon
G59 0600  2    was but a dim reflection, the peer of Caesar and vice-regent
G59 0610  1    of Christ, was so high above other human beings that
G59 0610 11    he had forgotten what they were like. He was a learned
G59 0620  9    and brilliant man, one of the best jurists in Europe
G59 0630  5    and with flashes of penetrating insight, and yet in
G59 0640  2    his dealings with other people, particularly when he
G59 0640 10    tried to be ingratiating, he was capable of an abysmal
G59 0650  8    stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension
G59 0660  6    of human nature and human motives.
G59 0670  1       This lofty disregard for others was not shared by
G59 0670 10    such men as Pierre Flotte and his associates, that
G59 0680  8    "brilliant group of mediocre men", as Powicke calls
G59 0690  5    them, who provided the brains for the French embassy
G59 0700  3    that came to Rome under the nominal leadership of the
G59 0710  1    archbishop of Narbonne, the duke of Burgundy, and the
G59 0710 10    count of St.-Pol. They had risen from humble beginnings
G59 0720  7    by their own diligence and astuteness, they were unfettered
G59 0730  6    by the codes that bound nobles like Othon or even the
G59 0740  6    older generation of clerks like Hotham, and they were
G59 0750  3    working for an end that their opponents had never even
G59 0750 13    visualized. Boniface was later to explain to the English
G59 0760  9    that Robert of Burgundy and Guy de St.-Pol were easy
G59 0770 10    enough to do business with; it was the clerks who caused
G59 0780  7    the mischief and who made him say that the ruling passion
G59 0790  5    of their race was covetousness and that in dealing
G59 0800  1    with them he never knew whether he had to do with a
G59 0800 13    Frenchman or with a devil. To the pope, head of the
G59 0810 10    universal Church, to the duke of Burgundy, taking full
G59 0820  5    advantage of his position on the borders of France
G59 0830  3    and of the Empire, or to Othon, who found it quite
G59 0830 14    natural that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary
G59 0840 10    and to the count of Savoy for Grandson, Flotte's outspoken
G59 0850  7    nationalism was completely incomprehensible. And yet
G59 0860  4    he made no pretense about it; when the pope, trying
G59 0870  4    no doubt to appeal to his better nature, said to him,
G59 0880  1    "You have already taken Normandy. Do you want to drive
G59 0880 11    the king of England from all his overseas possessions"?
G59 0890  8    the Frenchman's answer was a terse "Vous dites vrai".
G59 0900  8    Loyal and unscrupulous, with a single-minded ambition
G59 0910  6    to which he devoted all his energies, he outmatched
G59 0920  2    the English diplomats time and time again until, by
G59 0920 11    a kind of poetic justice, he fell at the battle of
G59 0930 10    Courtrai, the victim of the equally nationalistic if
G59 0940  5    less articulate Flemings.
G59 0940  8       The English, relying on a prejudiced arbiter and
G59 0950  8    confronted with superior diplomatic skill, were also
G59 0960  5    hampered in their negotiations by the events that were
G59 0970  3    taking place at home. The Scots had found a new leader
G59 0980  1    in William Wallace, and Edward's yearly expeditions
G59 0980  8    across the Border called for evermounting taxes, which
G59 0990  6    only increased his difficulties with the barons and
G59 1000  5    the clergy. He was unable to send any more help to
G59 1010  3    his allies on the Continent, and during the next few
G59 1010 13    years many of them, left to resist French pressure
G59 1020  8    unaided, surrendered to the inevitable and made their
G59 1030  5    peace with Philip. The defeat and death of Adolf of
G59 1050  2    Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked
G59 1050 12    to the disadvantage of the English, for all the efforts
G59 1060 10    to revive the anti-French coalition came to nothing
G59 1070  7    when Philip made an alliance with the new king of the
G59 1080  6    Romans.
G59 1080  7       These shifts in alliance and allegiance not only
G59 1090  4    increased the difficulties confronting the English
G59 1100  1    embassy as a whole, but also directly involved the
G59 1100 10    two Savoyards, Amadee and Othon. In spite of the armistice
G59 1110  8    negotiated by Amadee two years earlier, the war between
G59 1120  6    Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis of Savoy was
G59 1130  4    still going on, and although little is known about
G59 1140  1    it, that little proves that it was yet another phase
G59 1140 11    of the struggle against French expansion and was closely
G59 1150  7    interwoven with the larger conflict. A second truce
G59 1160  4    had been arbitrated in April, 1298, by Jean d'Arlay,
G59 1170  2    lord of Chalon-sur-Saone, the most staunch of Edward's
G59 1190  1    Burgundian allies, and these last were represented
G59 1190  8    in the discussions at the Curia by Gautier de Montfaucon,
G59 1200  8    Othon's neighbor and a member of the Vaudois coalition.
G59 1210  6       But although in many of these discussions Othon
G59 1220  3    and Amadee might have been tempted to consider their
G59 1230  2    own interests as well as those of the king, Edward's
G59 1230 12    confidence in them was so absolute that they were made
G59 1240 10    the acknowledged leaders of the embassy. Amadee may
G59 1250  6    have owed this partly to his relationship with the
G59 1260  3    king, but Othon, who at sixty seems still to have been
G59 1260 14    a simple knight, merited his position solely by his
G59 1270  8    own character and ability. The younger men, Vere, and
G59 1280  6    Pembroke, who was also Edward's cousin and whose Lusignan
G59 1290  5    blood gave him the swarthy complexion that caused Edward
G59 1300  3    of Carnarvon's irreverent friend, Piers Gaveston, to
G59 1310  2    nickname him "Joseph the Jew", were relatively new
G59 1310 10    to the game of diplomacy, but Pontissara had been on
G59 1320  8    missions to Rome before, and Hotham, a man of great
G59 1330  7    learning, "jocund in speech, agreeable to meet, of
G59 1340  4    honest religion, and pleasing in the eyes of all",
G59 1340 13    and an archbishop to boot, was as reliable and experienced
G59 1350  9    as Othon himself. But all the reports of this first
G59 1360  8    embassy show that the two Savoyards were the heads
G59 1370  4    of it, for they were the only ones who were empowered
G59 1380  1    to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's
G59 1380 13    decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in
G59 1390  9    the event that one was unavoidably absent.
G59 1400  2       This also gave them the unpleasant duty of being
G59 1410  2    spokesmen for the mission, and they could foresee that
G59 1410 11    that would not be easy. Underneath all the high-sounding
G59 1420  9    phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more
G59 1430  7    down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable
G59 1440  4    fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish allies
G59 1450  2    and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant
G59 1450 11    suzerain, the king of France, in return for being given
G59 1460 10    an equally free hand with the insubordinate Scots.
G59 1470  5    This was a doubly bitter blow to the king. In the eyes
G59 1480  5    of those who still cared for such things, it was a
G59 1490  2    reflection on his honor, and it gave further grounds
G59 1490 11    for complaint to his overtaxed subjects, who were already
G59 1500  7    grumbling- although probably not in Latin- "Non est
G59 1510  6    lex sana Quod regi sit mea lana". Bad relations between
G59 1520  4    England and Flanders brought hard times to the shepherds
G59 1530  2    scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the
G59 1530 13    crowded Flemish cities, and while the English, so far,
G59 1540  9    had done no more than grumble, Othon had seen what
G59 1550  6    the discontent might lead to, for before he left the
G59 1560  4    Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest
G59 1570  1    against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops,
G59 1570 10    and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly
G59 1580  7    difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued.
G59 1590  6       In all the talk of feudal rights, the knights and
G59 1600  4    bishops must never forget the woolworkers, nor was
G59 1610  1    it easy to do so, for all along the road to Italy they
G59 1610 14    passed the Florentine pack trains going home with their
G59 1620  7    loads of raw wool from England and rough Flemish cloth,
G59 1630  5    the former to be spun and woven by the Arte della Lana
G59 1640  4    and the latter to be refined and dyed by the Arte della
G59 1650  2    Calimala with the pigment recently discovered in Asia
G59 1650 10    Minor by one of their members, Bernardo Rucellai, the
G59 1660  9    secret of which they jealously kept for themselves.
G59 1670  5    These chatty merchants made amusing and instructive
G59 1680  2    traveling companions, for their business took them
G59 1680  9    to all four corners of the globe, and Florentine gossip
G59 1690  9    had already reached a high stage of development as
G59 1700  7    even a cursory glance at the Inferno will prove. A
G59 1710  4    northern ambassador, willing to keep his mouth shut
G59 1720  1    and his ears open, could learn a lot that would stand
G59 1720 12    him in good stead at the Curia.
G59 1730  4       They had other topics of conversation, besides their
G59 1740  2    news from courts and fairs, which were of interest
G59 1740 11    to Othon, the builder of castles in Wales and churches
G59 1750  9    in his native country. Behind him lay the Low Countries,
G59 1760  7    where men were still completing the cathedrals that
G59 1770  4    a later Florentine would describe as "a malediction
G59 1780  1    of little tabernacles, one on top of the other, with
G59 1780 11    so many pyramids and spires and leaves that it is a
G59 1790  9    wonder they stand up at all, for they look as though
G59 1800  6    they were made of paper instead of stone or marble";
G59 1810  1    the Low Countries, where the Middle Ages were to last
G59 1810 11    for another two centuries and die out only when Charles
G59 1820 10    the Bold of Burgundy met his first defeat in the fields
G59 1830  8    and forests below the walls of Grandson.
