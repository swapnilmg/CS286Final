K04 0010  1    The Bishop looked at him coldly and said "Take it or
K04 0010 12    leave it"!
K04 0020  1       Literally, there was nothing else to do. He was
K04 0020 10    caught in a machine. But Sojourner was not easily excited
K04 0030  9    or upset and said quite calmly: "Let's go and see what
K04 0040  7    it's like".
K04 0040  9       Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham,
K04 0050  9    near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River,
K04 0060  7    a small and dirty stream. The city was a center of
K04 0070  6    manufacture, especially in textiles, and also because
K04 0080  2    of the beauty of some of its surroundings, a residence
K04 0080 12    for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama.
K04 0090  9    But it had, as was usual in southern cities of this
K04 0100  7    sort, a Black Bottom, a low region near the river where
K04 0110  5    the Negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled together
K04 0120  2    in a region with no sewage save the river, where streets
K04 0130  1    and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much
K04 0130 10    poverty and crime.
K04 0140  1       Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked
K04 0140  9    the city over; the rather pleasant white city was on
K04 0150  9    the hill where the chief stores were. Beyond were industries
K04 0160  6    and factories. Then they went down to Black Bottom.
K04 0170  4    In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen African
K04 0180  2    Methodist Episcopal Church. It was an old and dirty
K04 0190  1    wooden structure, sadly in need of repair. But it was
K04 0190 11    a landmark. It had been there 50 years or more and
K04 0200  9    everybody in town, black and white, knew of it. It
K04 0210  5    had just suffered a calamity, the final crisis in a
K04 0220  1    long series of calamities. For the old preacher who
K04 0220 10    had been there twenty-five years was dead, and the
K04 0230  6    city mourned him.
K04 0230  9       He was a loud-voiced man, once vigorous but for
K04 0240  8    many years now declining in strength and ability. He
K04 0250  4    was stern and overbearing with his flock, but obsequious
K04 0260  1    and conciliatory with the whites, especially the rich
K04 0260  9    who partly supported the church. The Deacon Board,
K04 0270  7    headed by a black man named Carlson, had practically
K04 0280  5    taken over as the pastor grew old, and had its way
K04 0290  4    with the support of the Amen corner. The characteristic
K04 0300  1    thing about this church was its Amen corner and the
K04 0300 11    weekly religious orgy. A knot of old worshippers, chiefly
K04 0310  8    women, listened weekly to a sermon. It began invariably
K04 0320  5    in low tones, almost conversational, and then gradually
K04 0330  3    worked up to high, shrill appeals to God and man. And
K04 0340  1    then the Amen corner took hold, re-enacting a form
K04 0340 11    of group participation in worship that stemmed from
K04 0350  6    years before the Greek chorus, spreading down through
K04 0360  3    the African forest, overseas to the West Indies, and
K04 0370  2    then here in Alabama. With shout and slow dance, with
K04 0370 12    tears and song, with scream and contortion, the corner
K04 0380  8    group was beset by hysteria and shivering, wailing,
K04 0390  4    shouting, possession of something that seemed like
K04 0400  2    an alien and outside force. It spread to most of the
K04 0400 13    audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who
K04 0410  9    snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed
K04 0420  4    Negro religion. It sometimes ended in death-like trances
K04 0430  4    with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and
K04 0440  1    floor. To most of those who composed the Amen corner
K04 0440 11    it was a magnificent and beautiful experience, something
K04 0450  5    for which they lived from week to week. It was often
K04 0460  6    re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night
K04 0470  2    prayer meeting.
K04 0470  4       Wilson, on his first Sunday, witnessed this with
K04 0480  3    something like disgust. He had preached a short sermon,
K04 0490  1    trying to talk man-to-man to the audience, to tell
K04 0490 12    them who he was, what he had done in Macon and Birmingham,
K04 0500  8    and what he proposed to do here. He sympathized with
K04 0510  4    them on the loss of their old pastor. But then, at
K04 0520  2    mention of that name, the Amen corner broke loose.
K04 0520 11    He had no chance to say another word. At the very end,
K04 0530 10    when the audience was silent and breathless, a collection
K04 0540  5    was taken and then slowly everyone filed out. The audience
K04 0550  5    did not think much of the new pastor, and what the
K04 0560  2    new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare
K04 0560 12    at the time to say.
K04 0570  2       During the next weeks he looked over the situation.
K04 0570 11    First of all there was the parsonage, an utterly impossible
K04 0580 10    place for civilized people to live in, originally poorly
K04 0590  7    conceived, apparently not repaired for years, with
K04 0600  5    no plumbing or sewage, with rat-holes and rot. It was
K04 0610  3    arranged that he would board in the home of one of
K04 0610 14    the old members of the church, a woman named Catt who,
K04 0620 10    as Wilson afterward found, was briefly referred to
K04 0630  5    as The Cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative.
K04 0640  4       Ann Catt was a lonely, devoted soul, never married,
K04 0650  3    conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church,
K04 0650 12    but a perpetual dissenter and born critic. She soared
K04 0660  9    over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he
K04 0670  7    stray from the path and not know all the truth and
K04 0680  4    gossip of which she was chief repository.
K04 0680 11       Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its
K04 0690  9    condition. The salary of the pastor had for years been
K04 0700  8    $500 annually and even this was in arrears. Wilson
K04 0710  2    made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500,
K04 0720  1    but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said
K04 0720 11    nothing. The church itself must be repaired. It was
K04 0730  7    dirty and neglected. It really ought to be rebuilt,
K04 0740  5    and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks
K04 0750  1    about this. Meanwhile, the city itself should be talked
K04 0750 10    to. The streets in the colored section were dirty.
K04 0760  8    There was typhoid and malaria. The children had nowhere
K04 0770  5    to go and no place to play, not even sidewalks. The
K04 0780  2    school was small, dark and ill-equipped. The teacher
K04 0780 11    was a pliant fool. There were two liquor saloons not
K04 0790 10    very far from the church, one white, that is conducted
K04 0800  7    for white people with a side entrance for Negroes;
K04 0810  3    the other exclusively Negro. Undoubtedly, there was
K04 0820  2    a good deal of gambling in both.
K04 0820  9       On the other side of the church was a quiet, well-kept
K04 0830  6    house with shutters and recently painted. Wilson inquired
K04 0840  2    about it. It was called Kent House. The deacon of the
K04 0850  1    church, Carlson, was its janitor. One of the leading
K04 0850 10    members of the Amen corner was cook; there were two
K04 0860  8    or three colored maids employed there. Wilson was told
K04 0870  5    that it was a sort of hotel for white people, which
K04 0880  2    seemed to him rather queer. Why should a white hotel
K04 0880 12    be set down in the center of Black Bottom? But nevertheless
K04 0890 10    it looked respectable. He was glad to have it there.
K04 0900  8       The rest of Black Bottom was a rabbit warren of
K04 0910  7    homes in every condition of neglect, disrepair and
K04 0920  2    careful upkeep. Dives, carefully repaired huts, and
K04 0920  9    nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled
K04 0930  7    together cheek by jowl with little distinction. The
K04 0940  5    best could not escape from the worst and the worst
K04 0950  3    nestled cosily beside the better. The yards, front
K04 0950 11    and back, were narrow; some were trash dumps, some
K04 0960  8    had flower gardens. Behind were privies, for there
K04 0970  5    was no sewage system.
K04 0970  9       After looking about a bit, Wilson discovered beyond
K04 0980  7    Black Bottom, across the river and far removed from
K04 0990  5    the white city, a considerable tract of land, and it
K04 1000  3    occurred to him that the church and the better Negro
K04 1000 13    homes might gradually be moved to this plot. He talked
K04 1010  9    about it to the Presiding Elder. The Presiding Elder
K04 1020  5    looked him over rather carefully. He was not sure what
K04 1030  6    kind of a man he had in hand. But there was one thing
K04 1040  2    that he had to stress, and that was that the contribution
K04 1040 13    to the general church expenses, the dollar money, had
K04 1050  8    been seriously falling behind in this church, and that
K04 1060  7    must be looked after immediately. In fact, he intimated
K04 1070  4    clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been
K04 1080  2    sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar
K04 1080 11    money.
K04 1090  1       Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was,
K04 1090 10    they must have a better church, a more business-like
K04 1100  7    conduct of the church organization, and an effort to
K04 1110  5    get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship
K04 1120  1    into a modern church organization. He emphasized to
K04 1120  9    the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church
K04 1130 10    and moving across the river. The Presiding Elder was
K04 1140  6    sure that that would be impossible. But he told Wilson
K04 1150  5    to "go ahead and try". And Wilson tried.
K04 1160  1       It did seem impossible. The bank which held the
K04 1160 10    mortgage on the old church declared that the interest
K04 1170  7    was considerably in arrears, and the real estate people
K04 1180  5    said flatly that the land across the river was being
K04 1190  2    held for an eventual development for white working
K04 1190 10    people who were coming in, and that none would be sold
K04 1200 10    to colored folk. When it was proposed to rebuild the
K04 1210  6    church, Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage
K04 1220  4    were very high. He was sure that he could do better
K04 1220 15    if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed.
K04 1230 10       But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board,
K04 1240  7    he met unanimous opposition. The church certainly would
K04 1250  4    not be removed. The very proposition was sacrilege.
K04 1260  1    It had been here fifty years. It was going to stay
K04 1260 12    forever. It was hardly possible to get any argument
K04 1270  9    on the subject. As for rebuilding, well, that might
K04 1280  5    be looked into, but there was no hurry, no hurry at
K04 1290  3    all.
K04 1290  4       Wilson again went downtown to a different banker,
K04 1300  1    an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic,
K04 1300 10    but he shook his head.
K04 1310  5       "Reverend", he said, "I think you don't quite understand
K04 1320  3    the situation here. Don't you see the amount of money
K04 1330  3    that has been invested by whites around that church?
K04 1330 12    Tenements, stores, saloons, some gambling, I hope not
K04 1340  8    too much. The colored people are getting employment
K04 1350  5    at Kent House and other places, and they are near their
K04 1360  5    places of employment. When a city has arranged things
K04 1370  2    like this you cannot easily change them. Now, if I
K04 1370 12    were you I would just plan to repair the old church
K04 1380  9    so it would last for five or ten years. By that time,
K04 1390  6    perhaps something better can be done".
K04 1400  1       Then Wilson asked, "What about this Kent House which
K04 1400 10    you mention? I don't understand why a white hotel should
K04 1410 10    be down here".
K04 1420  1       The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise,
K04 1420 11    and then he said flatly: "I'm afraid I can't tell you
K04 1430 11    anything in particular about Kent House. You'll have
K04 1440  8    to find out about it on your own. Hope to see you again".
K04 1450  9    And he dismissed the colored pastor.
K04 1460  2       It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside
K04 1470  1    him and took his hand. She said, "My dear, do you know
K04 1470 13    what Kent House is"?
K04 1480  3       "No", said Wilson, "I don't. I was just asking about
K04 1490  4    it. What is it"?
K04 1490  8       "It's a house of prostitution for white men with
K04 1500  5    white girls as inmates. They hire a good deal of local
K04 1510  6    labor, including two members of our Trustee Board.
K04 1520  1    They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and
K04 1520 10    they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen
K04 1530  8    in town".
K04 1530 10       Wilson stared at her. "My dear, you must be mistaken".
K04 1540  9       "Talk to Mrs. Catt", she said.
K04 1550  5       And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to
K04 1560  4    others, he was absolutely amazed. This, of course,
K04 1560 12    was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern
K04 1570 12    cities- putting white houses of prostitution with colored
K04 1580  7    girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on
K04 1590  5    openly. But it had largely disappeared on account of
K04 1600  3    protest by the whites and through growing resentment
K04 1600 11    on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated
K04 1610 10    and got better wages.
K04 1620  1       But this situation of Kent House was more subtle.
K04 1620 10    The wages involved were larger and more regular. The
K04 1630  8    inmates were white and from out of town, avoiding local
K04 1640  7    friction. The backing from the white town was greater
K04 1650  4    and there was little publicity. Good wages, patronage
K04 1660  1    and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest
K04 1660  9    from Negroes. And yet Wilson knew that this place must
K04 1670  9    go or he must go. And for him to leave this job now
K04 1680  8    without accomplishing anything would mean practically
K04 1690  2    the end of his career in the Methodist church, if not
K04 1700  1    in all churches.
