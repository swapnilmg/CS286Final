N14 0010  1    While no larger than Dutch Springs, this mining supply
N14 0010 10    town had the appearance of being far busier and more
N14 0020  8    prosperous. Men crowded the streets and freight rigs
N14 0030  4    and teams were moving about. Although they were forced
N14 0040  2    to maintain a sharper watch, this activity enabled
N14 0040 10    them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular
N14 0050  9    attention being paid them.
N14 0060  2       "Gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here
N14 0070  2    at all", Cobb declared, glancing along the street as
N14 0070 11    they stretched their legs.
N14 0080  3       There were no less than six or seven saloons in
N14 0090  2    Ganado, not counting the lower class dives, all vying
N14 0090 11    for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters.
N14 0100  6    Pat only nodded. "Take one side of the street, and
N14 0110  6    I'll take the other", he proposed. "If you spot Carmer
N14 0120  4    give a yell before you move in".
N14 0120 11       Cobb's assent was tight. "You do the same. It's
N14 0130  9    all I ask, Stevens".
N14 0140  1       Separating, they took different sides of the main
N14 0140  9    drag and systematically combed the bars. Russ visited
N14 0150  7    two places without result and his blood pressure was
N14 0160  6    down to zero. Suddenly it seemed to him insane that
N14 0170  3    they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually, even
N14 0170 13    were he to prove the thief. He tramped out of the Miners
N14 0180 12    Rest with his hopes plummeting, and headed doggedly
N14 0190  6    for the Palace Saloon, the last place of any consequence
N14 0200  6    on this side of the street.
N14 0200 12       The Palace was an elaborate establishment, built
N14 0210  7    practically on stilts in front, with long flights of
N14 0220  6    wooden steps running up to the porch. Behind its ornate
N14 0230  3    facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest
N14 0240  1    to the rocky ribs of the canyonside. Russ ran up the
N14 0240 12    steps quickly to the plank porch. The front windows
N14 0250  7    of the place were long and narrow, reaching nearly
N14 0260  3    to the floor and affording an unusually good view of
N14 0270  1    the interior. Heading for the batwings, Cobb glanced
N14 0270  9    perfunctorily through the nearest window, and suddenly
N14 0280  7    dodged aside. Nerves tight as a bowstring, he paused
N14 0290  5    to gather his wits.
N14 0290  9       Against all expectation, Carmer was inside, clearly
N14 0300  5    enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that
N14 0310  4    it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything
N14 0320  1    or anyone about him. Fierce anger surged through Russ.
N14 0320 10    He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the
N14 0330 10    vicious puncher on the spot.
N14 0340  1       Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows,
N14 0340 11    he feverishly scanned the busy street below. Stevens
N14 0350  8    was nowhere in sight. Muffling an exclamation, Russ
N14 0360  5    sprang to the nearest steps and ran down. As luck had
N14 0370  5    it, he had not gone twenty feet in the street before
N14 0380  1    Pat appeared.
N14 0380  3       "What luck, Cobb"? he said swiftly.
N14 0390  1       Russ pointed upward. "He's there", he got out tersely,
N14 0400  1    curbing his rising excitement. Hitching his cartridge
N14 0400  8    belt around, Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace
N14 0410  7    and started that way with Cobb at his side.
N14 0420  4       Climbing the steps steadily, they reached the top
N14 0430  2    and headed for the door. Pat pushed through first.
N14 0430 11    Forced behind him momentarily, Russ followed at once
N14 0440  7    and halted two steps inside. His eyes widened. While
N14 0450  5    five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of
N14 0460  2    easy revelry, with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure, it
N14 0460 11    was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday.
N14 0470 10    Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen.
N14 0480  4       A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its
N14 0490  3    track, and another dozed at one of the card tables.
N14 0490 13    Two men murmured with their heads together at the end
N14 0500  8    of the bar, while the sleek-headed bartender absently
N14 0510  3    polished a glass. Looking the setup over, Stevens started
N14 0520  3    coolly for the rear of the place.
N14 0520 10       "Where yuh goin'"?
N14 0530  2       It was the barkeep. Halting, Pat turned to survey
N14 0540  2    him deliberately. He did not reply, going on toward
N14 0540 11    the back. Less assured than the tall, wide-shouldered
N14 0550  7    man in the lead, Cobb followed alertly, a hand on his
N14 0560  6    gun butt. The bartender measured this situation with
N14 0570  2    heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it. He
N14 0570 13    said no more.
N14 0580  2       A hall opened in back of the bar, running toward
N14 0580 12    an ell. Pat moved into it. Small rooms, probably for
N14 0590  9    cards, opened off on either side. All the doors were
N14 0600  6    open at this hour except one, and it was toward this
N14 0610  3    that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder.
N14 0620  1       The door was locked. A single kick made it spring
N14 0620 11    open, shuddering. Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward,
N14 0630  8    a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike. Russ
N14 0650  6    sprang through to bat it nimbly aside. With a bellow
N14 0660  4    Carmer lunged at him. But he was more than half-drunk,
N14 0670  1    and his faculties were dulled. Cobb unleashed a single
N14 0670 10    powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing
N14 0680  8    down with a whining groan. He started to struggle up,
N14 0690  6    heaving desperately. Russ gave him a brutal thrust
N14 0700  2    that tumbled him over flat on his stomach. Kneeling,
N14 0700 11    Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back,
N14 0710 11    holding him pinned.
N14 0720  1       "Okay, Stevens. I've drawn his fangs", he snapped.
N14 0720  9    "Go through his pockets, will you? If we have to we'll
N14 0730 11    take him apart and see what he's made of"!
N14 0740  7       Complying methodically, Pat pulled pocket after
N14 0750  5    pocket inside out without finding a thing. Cobb watched
N14 0760  2    this with hunted eyes, his desperate hope waning by
N14 0760 11    the moment. Stevens was grunting over the last empty
N14 0770  8    pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's
N14 0780  6    hat, which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when
N14 0790  4    he first fell. Cobb got it. Straightening up, his eyes
N14 0800  2    ablaze, he held out the battered Stetson.
N14 0800  9       "Look at this"!
N14 0810  2       Inside the crown, stuffed behind the stained sweatband,
N14 0820  1    could be seen thin, crumpled wads of currency. Carmer's
N14 0820 10    ingenious cache for his loot had been found.
N14 0830  8    #14#
N14 0830  9    "By golly, Stevens! You were right", Russ exclaimed,
N14 0840  6    tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat. "That
N14 0850  5    is, if we can be sure this is Colcord's money"-
N14 0860  1       Pat grunted. "Where else would he get it? Count
N14 0870  1    what you've got there, Cobb. We can soon tell".
N14 0870 10       Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it
N14 0880 10    was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly.
N14 0890  6    Pat nodded. "It's within a hundred of what Crip had",
N14 0900  6    he declared. "We know Penny spent some- and Carmer
N14 0910  5    must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on".
N14 0920  1       Handing the money over, Russ wiped his hands on
N14 0920 10    his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean.
N14 0930  8    His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful. "Shall we
N14 0940  6    get out of here"?
N14 0940 10       Leaving the card room, they moved back through the
N14 0950  9    Palace the way they had come. Glowering looks met them
N14 0960  7    in the bar, but there was no attempt to halt them.
N14 0970  4    Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him, Pat
N14 0980  1    looked his unspoken warning and stepped out. He and
N14 0980 10    Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street.
N14 0990  8       Neither spoke till they reached their horses. Pat
N14 1000  4    paused there, looking across at the young fellow. It'll
N14 1010  2    be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord
N14 1020  1    and tell him about it, Russ". He started to return
N14 1020 11    it.
N14 1020 12       To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand. "Not
N14 1030 10    me", he ruled decidedly. I've had enough. It was you
N14 1040  7    that tracked it down anyway, Stevens", he pursued strictly.
N14 1050  4    "I'll shove along home".
N14 1060  1       "Whatever you say". Pat swung into the saddle, yet
N14 1060 10    still he delayed, his brows puckered. "You owe it to
N14 1070  8    Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was
N14 1080  6    defending you, really", he observed mildly.
N14 1090  1       "Old Crip wasn't", retorted Cobb tartly. "He'll
N14 1100  1    know when you tell him. But I want this to sink in
N14 1100 13    awhile. Then maybe next time he won't be so quick on
N14 1110  9    the trigger".
N14 1110 11       "Pat had never pretended to give advice in such
N14 1120  9    affairs. "You're the doctor", he returned with a smile.
N14 1130  7    "But I still think Penny's an awful nice girl, Russ"-
N14 1140  6       "You don't have to tell me", flashed Cobb. Giving
N14 1150  5    the other a dark look, he hauled his bronc around and
N14 1160  3    trotted down off the street. Pat let him go, following
N14 1170  1    more leisurely. At the first restaurant he sensibly
N14 1170  9    pulled up to go in for his dinner, and as a consequence
N14 1180  8    did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth
N14 1190  5    of the canyon and head straight across the swells for
N14 1200  2    Antler.
N14 1200  3       The truth was, the puncher was both bewildered and
N14 1210  2    dismayed by his own mixed luck. "Penny's always glad
N14 1210 11    to see me over there", he mused bleakly. Yet had he
N14 1220  9    not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have
N14 1230  7    been involved in this latest tangle.
N14 1240  1       Over and above that, however, was his growing suspicion
N14 1240 10    of Chuck Stober's part in recent events. "Gyp Carmer
N14 1250  8    couldn't have known about Colcord's money unless he
N14 1260  7    was told- and who else would have told him"? he asked
N14 1270  6    himself. "It's the second time War Ax hands made a
N14 1280  5    play for that money.
N14 1280  9       How much of an accident could that be"?
N14 1290  4       Nearing home, he jerked to attention at the distant
N14 1300  3    crack of a gun. In town no one paid much attention
N14 1300 14    to an occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had
N14 1310  9    a meaning. Hauling up, Russ listened carefully. Two
N14 1320  5    minutes later it came again- a double explosion, followed
N14 1330  3    by a third, sounding more distant.
N14 1330  9       As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from
N14 1340  9    the direction of the Antler ranch house. He tightened
N14 1350  6    up in a twinkling. So far as he knew, only his father
N14 1360  4    could be there. What did it mean? Clapping spurs to
N14 1370  2    the bronc he set off at a sharp canter, with growing
N14 1370 13    alarm.
N14 1380  1       His first glimpse of the ranch house across the
N14 1380 10    brushy swells told him nothing. Still a quarter-mile
N14 1390  7    away, the fresh clap of guns only served to increase
N14 1400  3    his speed. Setting a course straight for the house,
N14 1410  1    he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed
N14 1410 11    past close to his face.
N14 1420  2       When it was followed by a second, whining even closer,
N14 1425  1    Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression. He knew
N14 1430  9    now what he was up against. Whoever was out there hiding
N14 1440  8    in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house
N14 1450  4    and, having spotted his approach, was determined to
N14 1460  2    drive him off before he could get into the fight.
N14 1460 12       Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few
N14 1470  9    days without a rifle in his saddle boot, Russ drew
N14 1480  6    his Colt and examined it briefly. If he wondered whether
N14 1490  3    the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested,
N14 1500  1    he had his answer a moment later.
N14 1500  8       "Over this way! He ain't gone far"! a harsh cry
N14 1510  6    floated to him across the brush.
N14 1520  1       A carbine cracked more loudly, and a slug clipped
N14 1520 10    fragments from the brush off at one side. The would-be
N14 1530  9    assassin had his position figured pretty close. Dismounting,
N14 1540  4    Russ looked about hastily. Toward the west this depression
N14 1550  4    led toward a draw. Leading his pony, he hurried that
N14 1560  2    way, not remounting till he was well below the level
N14 1560 12    of the surrounding range.
N14 1570  2       Swinging up then, and bending forward over the horn,
N14 1580  2    he urged his mount down the meandering draw. He had
N14 1580 12    not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from
N14 1590  9    somewhere behind. He had been sighted, and his attacker
N14 1600  6    pumping shot after shot. A shot or two went wild before
N14 1610  4    Cobb felt something tug at his foot. A slug had torn
N14 1620  1    half of his stirrup-guard away. A second twitched his
N14 1620 11    shirtsleeve, and he felt a brief burn on his upper
N14 1630 10    arm. Another snarled close overhead.
N14 1640  1       "Jumping Jerusalem! Let's get out of here"!
N14 1650  1       At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the
N14 1650 12    left toward the side of the winding draw. The long
N14 1660  9    minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless.
N14 1670  4    Sweeping a look around, he saw that he was safe for
N14 1680  4    the moment. He heard cries from behind him, but he
N14 1680 14    could make out no words.
N14 1690  5       He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw,
N14 1700  3    and made it. Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise
N14 1700 11    into an intersecting draw, he plunged forward with
N14 1710  7    undiminished speed. Gradually the wash climbed upward,
N14 1720  5    forcing him toward open range. Yet he must chance it.
N14 1730  3    He clambered out of the dwindling wash, the loose dirt
N14 1740  1    flying behind him, and flashed a look about.
