A29 0010  1       Greer Garson world-famous star of stage, screen
A29 0010  9    and television, will be honored for the high standard
A29 0020  8    in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has
A29 0030  5    created a high standard in her profession.
A29 0040  1       As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired
A29 0040 10    Miss Garson is a personification of the individual
A29 0050  7    look so important to fashion this season. She will
A29 0060  5    receive the 1961 "Oscar" at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus
A29 0070  3    Exposition, Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom
A29 0080  2    of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel.
A29 0080  7    ##
A29 0080  8    THE ONLY WOMAN recipient, Miss Garson will receive
A29 0090  6    the award with Ferdinando Sarmi, creator of chic, beautiful
A29 0100  6    women's fashions; Harry Rolnick, president of the Byer-Rolnick
A29 0110  6    Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats; Sydney
A29 0120  5    Wragge, creator of sophisticated casuals for women
A29 0130  3    and Roger Vivier, designer of Christian Dior shoes
A29 0130 11    Paris, France, whose squared toes and lowered heels
A29 0140  8    have revolutionized the shoe industry.
A29 0150  4       The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at
A29 0160  2    noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus, president of Neiman-Marcus,
A29 0170  1    Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will
A29 0170 10    be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral
A29 0180  6    Palsy Treatment Center.
A29 0190  1       The attractive Greer Garson, who loves beautiful
A29 0190  8    clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her
A29 0200 10    professional roles, prefers timeless classical designs.
A29 0210  4    Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for
A29 0220  4    a fun piece simple because "It's unlike me".
A29 0230  1    ##
A29 0230  1    IN PRIVATE LIFE, Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson
A29 0240  2    and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas,
A29 0245  1    where they maintain an apartment, to their California
A29 0250  8    home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch
A29 0260  7    in Pecos, New Mexico. Therefore, her wardrobe is largely
A29 0270  5    mobile, to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake
A29 0280  4    out without a wrinkle.
A29 0280  8       Her creations in fashion are from many designers
A29 0290  5    because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any
A29 0300  3    one designer any more than she wants "all of her pictures
A29 0310  1    by one painter".
A29 0310  4    ##
A29 0310  5    A FAVORITE is Norman Norell, however. She likes his
A29 0320  5    classic chemise. Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell,
A29 0330  4    a black and white organdy and silk jersey.
A29 0330 12       Irene suits rate high because they are designed
A29 0340  8    for her long-bodied silhouette. She also likes the
A29 0345  5    femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and
A29 0360  2    Helen Rose.
A29 0360  4       Balenciaga is her favorite European designer.
A29 0370  2       "I bought my first dress from him when I was still
A29 0380  1    a struggling young actress", she reminisces. "I like
A29 0380  9    his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate
A29 0390  8    the great impact he has on fashion".
A29 0400  3    ##
A29 0400  4    BLACK AND WHITE is her favorite color combination along
A29 0410  3    with lively glowing pinks, reds, blues and greens.
A29 0420  1       Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent, Greer Garson
A29 0420  8    was born in County Down, Ireland. Her mother was a
A29 0430 10    Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney
A29 0440  6    Isles.
A29 0440  7       Reared in England, she studied to be a teacher,
A29 0450  7    earned several scholarships and was graduated with
A29 0460  2    honors from the University of London. She took postgraduate
A29 0470  1    work at the University of Grenoble in France and then
A29 0470 11    returned to London to work on market research with
A29 0480  9    an advertising firm.
A29 0480 12    ##
A29 0490  1    HER ACTING began with the Birmingham Repertory Company
A29 0500  1    and she soon became the toast of the West End. Among
A29 0500 12    stage performances was a starring role in "Golden Arrow"
A29 0510  8    directed by Noel Coward. It was during "Old Music"
A29 0520  7    at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B.
A29 0530  5    Mayer spotted her.
A29 0530  8       After signing a motion-picture contract, she came
A29 0540  8    to America and had "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" as her first
A29 0550  6    assignment after a year's wait. Other triumphs include
A29 0560  4    "Random Harvest", "Madame Curie", "Pride and Prejudice",
A29 0570  4    "The Forsythe Saga" and "Mrs. Miniver" (which won her
A29 0580  5    the Academy Award in 1943).
A29 0580 10    ##
A29 0580 11    HONORS that have come to Greer Garson are countless.
A29 0590  9    Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time
A29 0600  9    for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt
A29 0610  7    in "Sunrise at Campobello". She gave a fine portrayal
A29 0620  6    of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared
A29 0630  4    in live television from "Captain Brassbound's Conversion"
A29 0640  2    to "Camille". She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in
A29 0650  2    London, a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary
A29 0650 12    colonel in many states.
A29 0660  4       She is adept at skeet shooting, trout fishing, Afro-Cuban
A29 0670  3    and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology.
A29 0680  1    She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas
A29 0680 12    Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and
A29 0690  8    on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine
A29 0700  7    Arts. She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis
A29 0710  5    and Cancer Associations. Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher
A29 0720  6    husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America
A29 0730  4    and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that
A29 0740  1    flourishes in New Mexico.
A29 0750  1       Back in college, today's handsome Gander was the
A29 0750  9    only male member of a Texas Tech class on food. The
A29 0760 10    pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long- but
A29 0770  6    he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.
A29 0780  1       Last October he gave a public speech in Washington,
A29 0780 10    D.C. entitled "Are Women Here to Stay"? So you can
A29 0790 10    see that Gerald G. Ramsey, director of SMU's food
A29 0800  7    services, is not the ordinary type of craven, women-trodden
A29 0810  7    chef. He is apt to rear back and claim his rights.
A29 0820  5    ##
A29 0820  6    RAMSEY, as SMU's food wrangler, buys enough groceries
A29 0830  5    to serve 32,000 meals a week. Tell that to the little
A29 0840  5    wife when she moans at the woman's burden!
A29 0850  1       He also dishes up 3,000 snacks. And he operates
A29 0850 10    three cafeterias in the Student Center, along with
A29 0860  7    McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables.
A29 0870  3       Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says, "I can't
A29 0880  3    remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me
A29 0890  1    to cook".
A29 0890  3    ##
A29 0890  4    HE WAS IN CHARGE of the Hockaday School meals from
A29 0900  3    1946 to 1950, before he moved to SMU. And you'll notice
A29 0910  2    that in both places, there are acres of charming young
A29 0910 12    ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line.
A29 0920 10       What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at
A29 0930  6    the training table?
A29 0940  1       "Mostly meat and potatoes- they have to have that
A29 0940  9    go-go-go without getting too fat", says Ramsey. So
A29 0950  7    he hides the mayonnaise. And to keep athletes' stomachs
A29 0960  4    from getting jumpy under physical duress, he bans all
A29 0970  4    highly flavored condiments.
A29 0970  7    ##
A29 0970  8    WHAT DO the pretty SMU girls like on their plates?
A29 0980  8       "Pretty much hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night,
A29 0990  7    maybe pizza", says the handsome food expert. "Unfortunately,
A29 1000  4    there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower".
A29 1010  4       Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman, Henry Cabot Lodge,
A29 1020  4    the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and other shiny
A29 1030  3    characters. Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron
A29 1030 11    robes, filed through the cafeteria line.
A29 1040  6       "They aren't supposed to look at women, you know",
A29 1050  7    Ramsey recalled. "What with all those pretty girls
A29 1060  4    around, they had a hard time".
A29 1060 10    #CHICKEN CADILLAC#
A29 1070  1    Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest. Salt
A29 1070 11    and pepper each breast. Dip in melted butter and roll
A29 1080  9    in flour. Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking
A29 1090  8    pan. Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until
A29 1100  3    lightly brown.
A29 1100  5       Add enough warmed cream, seasoned to taste with
A29 1110  4    onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts.
A29 1120  1    Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.
A29 1120  9       While this is baking, saute mushrooms, fresh or
A29 1130  5    canned, in butter. Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts.
A29 1140  4    Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham
A29 1150  1    and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.
A29 1150  7       (Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac,
A29 1160  8    says Ramsey.)
A29 1170  1       Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor
A29 1170  8    straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern, many
A29 1180  7    design facets, warmth, dignity and an effect of utter
A29 1190  6    comfort and livability.
A29 1190  9       That is the goal of two new collections being introduced
A29 1200  8    in Dallas this month.
A29 1210  1       Though there has been some avant garde indication
A29 1210  9    that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy
A29 1220  8    look of the '20's and '40's, two manufacturers chose
A29 1230  4    to take the approach of the sophisticated, but warm
A29 1240  3    look in contemporary. These two, Heritage and Drexel,
A29 1250  1    chose too not to produce the exactly matching design
A29 1250 10    for every piece, but a collection of correlated designs,
A29 1260  7    each of which could stand alone.
A29 1270  1       The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-Harris
A29 1270 10    and Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types
A29 1280  8    of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer
A29 1290  6    ever assembled together at one time. Called Perennian,
A29 1300  4    to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow quality,
A29 1310  2    the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical
A29 1310 10    pieces.
A29 1320  1       Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of
A29 1320  8    burl, hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble
A29 1330  8    are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of
A29 1340  7    permanence, the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled
A29 1350  4    floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring
A29 1360  1    in the outdoors. It is a collection with a custom-design
A29 1360 12    look, offering simplicity with warmth, variety and
A29 1370  6    vitality.
A29 1370  7       The Drexel collection, called Composite, to be shown
A29 1380  6    by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating,
A29 1390  4    a mature modern that is a variation of many designs.
A29 1400  2       Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled
A29 1410  1    doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus
A29 1410 10    softening arches, table tops are inlaid in Macassar
A29 1420  7    ebony or acacia. A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach
A29 1430  6    serving, a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked
A29 1440  3    under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch
A29 1450  1    long chest.
A29 1450  3       An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented,
A29 1460  1    with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers
A29 1460 10    and corner units and a canted headboard. The other
A29 1470  9    bedroom has heavier styling, door-fronted dressers
A29 1480  4    with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed with arched
A29 1490  3    acacia panels and matching mirror.
A29 1490  8       Colorful, bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with
A29 1500  5    the magenta, pink and white tones predominating as
A29 1510  3    well as golden shades are used with Composite. The
A29 1520  1    fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.
A29 1530  1       Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms
A29 1530  8    but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's
A29 1540  5    fall 1961 group, Composite. The spider-leg pedestal
A29 1550  5    table has a base finished in an ebony, to set off the
A29 1560  4    lustrous brown of the walnut top. See-through design
A29 1560 13    of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back
A29 1570  9    and an Oriental shoji flavor. To bring warmth to the
A29 1580  7    dining area, golden orange tones are used in the fabrics.
A29 1590  6       Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary manner, reflecting
A29 1600  3    the best aspects of today's design, with substance
A29 1610  1    and maturity, keynote the Perennian collection from
A29 1610  8    Heritage. Center panel, hand-screened wood, actually
A29 1620  6    is a back of one of the tall bookcases. Mellow bronzy-green-gold
A29 1630  6    fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic
A29 1640  5    accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander
A29 1650  1    Smith carpet in all wool loop pile.
A29 1660  1       The Vagabonds are "on the road" again. Members are
A29 1660 10    on their way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in
A29 1670 10    air-conditioned cars.
A29 1680  1       This coming weekend they have reserved the entire
A29 1680  9    Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club, Saledo,
A29 1690  6    for festivities. Invitations have been extended to
A29 1700  5    some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price
A29 1710  3    Daniel.
A29 1710  4       Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on
A29 1720  3    the Old Chisholm Trail.
A29 1720  7    ##
A29 1720  8    THE GET-TOGETHER Friday night will be a banquet at
A29 1730  8    the country club patio and pool, and an orchestra will
A29 1740  5    play for dancing.
A29 1740  8       Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm
A29 1750  5    Trail Days. Ginghams and calico will be popular dress
A29 1760  4    for the women. The men will be in western attire, including
A29 1770  2    Stetsons and colored vests.
A29 1770  6    ##
A29 1770  7    DECORATING the ballroom will be the yellow rose of
A29 1790  7    Texas, in tall bushes; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes.
A29 1800  4    There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with
A29 1810  3    eyes that flash at the guests.
A29 1810  9       Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the
A29 1820  8    Saledo trip. Committee members aiding them in planning
A29 1830  5    the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy McKee,
A29 1840  3    George McElyee, Jack Fanning, W. H. Roquemore and Joe
A29 1850  3    Darrow.
A29 1850  4    ##
A29 1850  5    THE TRAVEL CLUB is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples
A29 1860  5    who have as their motto "Go Somewhere, Anywhere, Everywhere".
A29 1870  2    Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of
A29 1880  2    1962 when they go to Europe.
A29 1880  8       In the past, the men and women have chartered planes
A29 1890  4    to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral Wells and
A29 1900  3    Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport
A29 1900 10    and Galveston.
A29 1910  2       Four parties are given a year. Two of these are
A29 1920  1    in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.
A29 1920 12       Serving on the club's board are Mmes R. P. Anderson,
A29 1930 10    president; A. F. Schmalzried, secretary; W. H. Roquemore,
A29 1950  1    treasurer, and the following chairmen: Mmes McKee,
A29 1950  8    publicity; Lawrence B. Jones, yearbook, and Sam Laughlin,
A29 1960  8    scrapbook.
