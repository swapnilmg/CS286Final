N25 0010  1       EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine. The enemy came
N25 0010 11    looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took
N25 0020 10    a hasty shot, then fled without knowing the result,
N25 0030  5    ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs
N25 0040  4    were rubbery. As his feet slowed, he felt ashamed of
N25 0040 14    the panic and resolved to make a stand. He crossed
N25 0050 10    the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle
N25 0060  7    trail resumed.
N25 0060  9       In the leafiest part of the tree, straddling a broad
N25 0070  8    horizontal limb, he could see over the meadow. For
N25 0080  1    a while he was content to let events develop in their
N25 0090  1    good time. He had no doubt the marine was the lead
N25 0090 12    scout of a column, and while his shot had probably
N25 0100  7    bred indecision, they would soon come hunting.
N25 0110  2       His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured
N25 0120  1    others for the sheer pleasure. Yesterday; today; tomorrow:
N25 0120  9    no surrender. His remembering the self-dictate brought
N25 0130  8    no peace- only a faint chill of doubt. He murmured
N25 0140  8    to himself, with firmness: "No surrender". It was best
N25 0150  5    to die fighting the marines. His superiors had also
N25 0160  3    preached this, saying it was the way for eternal honor.
N25 0170  1       What if the marines never came? His comrades were
N25 0170 10    all dead. He had no rice. Then it would be a choice
N25 0180 11    between starvation and suicide.
N25 0190  1       Whichever the way, he would rot in this vast choking
N25 0190 11    green, his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes.
N25 0200 11    He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk.
N25 0210  7    His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife. The
N25 0220  5    knife, an ammunition pouch, and a half-filled bottle
N25 0230  1    of purified water hung on his belt. Besides the belt
N25 0230 11    he wore a loin cloth.
N25 0240  2       As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer, he
N25 0240 13    saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing. Gloom
N25 0250 10    receded.
N25 0250 11       The marine came to the edge of the green jungle
N25 0260 10    mist and stayed, as though debating whether to brave
N25 0270  5    the sunlight. His fatigues made a streak of almost
N25 0280  3    phosphorescent green in the mist.
N25 0280  8       "Come out, come out in the meadow", Matsuo said
N25 0290  7    under his breath.
N25 0290 10       The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve
N25 0300  9    across his face. A signal? Matsuo lifted his rifle,
N25 0320  5    easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness.
N25 0330  2       Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when
N25 0340  1    his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills. They
N25 0340 10    had fought from caves, and the marines resorted to
N25 0350  7    burning them out. Even now, like a ringing in his ears,
N25 0360  6    he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great
N25 0370  2    orange billows. A wave of flame rippling through their
N25 0380  1    cave had reached Nagamo, his friend, and with a shriek
N25 0380 11    the man bolted through the entrance, then slowed to
N25 0390  7    the jerky walk of a puppet, his uniform blazing. The
N25 0400  4    marines let him advance. When he sank on his knees,
N25 0410  1    they had allowed him to char without administering
N25 0410  9    the stroke of mercy.
N25 0420  2       Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack
N25 0420 12    of corpses, both the burned and the unburned, the latter
N25 0430  9    decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun. The callous
N25 0440  7    marines had laughed at each other's retching, while
N25 0450  3    stacking bodies. Matsuo repeatedly choked down his
N25 0460  2    own nausea. At nightfall he had been able to sneak
N25 0460 12    down a hillside and into the jungle, reeking of death.
N25 0470  8       Apprehensively he peered to the left, to the right
N25 0490  7    into the leafy, vine-crisscrossed maze. He decided
N25 0500  3    that the marines must be deploying around the meadow,
N25 0500 12    with the one left to distract him. He strained his
N25 0510 10    hearing. Cautious feet stepping on leafmold; faint
N25 0520  5    creaking of belts and slings; whispers: he heard none
N25 0530  4    of these. Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering
N25 0540  2    call of a bird. Because he couldn't hear them, he was
N25 0550  1    more convinced they were there.
N25 0550  6       A spectacle occurred across the meadow: the lone
N25 0560  4    marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise
N25 0570  1    on a tree trunk, he embraced it. Humiliation made Matsuo
N25 0570 11    tremble. While his comrades cocked the trap, that one
N25 0580  9    behaved as if it was some dull maneuver. Taking aim
N25 0590  5    at the man's face, Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to
N25 0600  4    the point of discharge, and then he changed his mind.
N25 0610  1    He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear, and so
N25 0610 11    he aimed above the head.
N25 0620  2       The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes
N25 0620  8    of sound. Hush followed. Like a mischievous boy expecting
N25 0630  8    punishment, Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle.
N25 0640  6    How stupid to give his position away.
N25 0650  2       The jungle did not retort. The sitter remained seated
N25 0660  1    hugging the tree. Before long the atmosphere reverted
N25 0660  9    to its old normalcy, and insects hummed and birds occasionally
N25 0670  7    called. Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete
N25 0680  7    passiveness, concluding that he was the butt of a devilish
N25 0690  7    joke.
N25 0690  8       Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled
N25 0700  4    up and stepped into sunlight, immediately throwing
N25 0710  1    his hands over his eyes. He went into a whirling dance,
N25 0710 12    a sort of blind chasing of the tail. It ended when
N25 0720  9    he tumbled; but jumping right up, he staggered in no
N25 0730  6    particular direction. He wore no head cover of any
N25 0740  3    kind and, more odd, had no visible weapon.
N25 0740 11       With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's
N25 0750  6    direction, crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop.
N25 0760  5    When he got closer to the tree, Matsuo noted the wild
N25 0770  4    look on his face. The pockets of his jacket bulged.
N25 0770 14    Hand grenades.
N25 0780  2       the bobbing head was a poor target, so Matsuo shot
N25 0790  1    him in the upper trunk.
N25 0790  6       The marine spun, clapping a hand high on his chest,
N25 0800  4    and dived forward. In the hush that followed the echoes,
N25 0810  1    Matsuo was tense. They could come on him now without
N25 0810 11    difficulty. Gradually he reached a conclusion. The
N25 0820  7    marine was alone, for they were impatient people and
N25 0830  5    by now would have vied to knock him from the tree.
N25 0840  3       Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge
N25 0840 13    of foliage. The marine was sprawled some thirty yards
N25 0850  9    away, one arm extended. Matsuo jumped when the hidden
N25 0860  6    arm flopped out. Reflex?
N25 0870  1       Rifle leveled on the man, he made a rush. Heat,
N25 0870 11    in the sunlight, pressed in like an invisible crowd.
N25 0880  6       He squatted by the head, gently placing the rifle
N25 0900  1    on the ground. With a snakestrike motion he grasped
N25 0900 10    the hair, and, twisting, pulled the marine over on
N25 0910  9    his back. He was bearded. The bullet had penetrated
N25 0920  5    in the area of the right collarbone; around the hole,
N25 0930  4    blood glistened in a little patch. Maintaining his
N25 0940  1    clutch on the hair, Matsuo watched the closed eyes
N25 0940 10    while rummaging in the jacket pockets. In one: a package
N25 0950  8    of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter, both sticky
N25 0960  4    from the man's bleeding. In the other: a wristwatch
N25 0970  2    with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief.
N25 0970 10    One by one he tossed the objects aside. He didn't smoke
N25 0980 11    and could not light fires with a flintless lighter;
N25 0990  6    he had no use any longer for exact time, even had the
N25 1000  5    watch been running. Then there was no saying how many
N25 1010  2    times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief.
N25 1020  1       Too bad the marine had no water. From its holder
N25 1020 11    he took his own canteen. The cap was stuck and made
N25 1030  7    a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure. The
N25 1040  3    marine's eyes opened, squeezed shut, then opened squinted
N25 1050  1    in the glare.
N25 1050  4       So, alive. Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips.
N25 1060  3    The marine reached up a hand. Matsuo shook his head.
N25 1060 13    "None for you". The marine blinked, soon dropping his
N25 1070  9    hand. Not only had he no canteen, but he lacked even
N25 1080  9    the belt to hang one on. "You came well equipped to
N25 1090  5    die".
N25 1090  6       Some odor made him lean over the man. He sniffed
N25 1100  5    and recognized it. Sake. So that had been his difficulty.
N25 1110  2    Drunk on sake, he must have wandered off from his bivouac.
N25 1120  2       The marine tried to roll on his right side, and
N25 1120 12    moaned. When he rolled on the left side, propping on
N25 1130 10    his left elbow, Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him
N25 1140  7    back over. "Be a good turtle".
N25 1150  1       Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back
N25 1150 10    on the water bottle. The smell of sake had freshened
N25 1160  8    yesterday's events in his thoughts. In the caves, with
N25 1170  6    other supplies, they had kept cases of sake.
N25 1180  2       The marine shut his eyes. "Are you a thrower of
N25 1190  1    flame, marine"? Matsuo took the small knife from its
N25 1190 10    scabbard and laid it on the ground, out of the marine's
N25 1200 10    reach and away from their shadows. He waited in his
N25 1210  6    squat, gripping the hair.
N25 1210 10       Every so often he turned the knife. Its blade was
N25 1220 10    dazzling in the intense sunlight. The sun was noon
N25 1230  5    high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping.
N25 1240  2    Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had
N25 1240 12    an oily film. The man had thrown the left hand over
N25 1250 11    his eyes. Now and again he murmured something that
N25 1260  6    ended in a giggle. He must have saturated himself in
N25 1270  3    the drink, for the bullet not to shock him out of his
N25 1280  1    drunken haze. Matsuo shook his head. Strange.
N25 1280  8       At last he reached for the knife. Even the bone
N25 1290  7    handle scorched, and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief
N25 1300  4    to wrap it. First he barely touched the blade on the
N25 1310  4    hand which shaded the eyes. The marine yelled and flung
N25 1320  1    the hand away. With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo
N25 1320 13    applied the blade flat on a cheek. A shrill yelp, kicked
N25 1330 10    legs, and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist.
N25 1340  5    Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat;
N25 1350  4    burned the other cheek; burned each hand when they
N25 1360  2    came groping again. The marine commenced to weep and
N25 1360 11    it blighted the sense of enjoyment.
N25 1370  5       Matsuo stood up. "A small measure of payment, marine".
N25 1380  4    He dropped the knife in its scabbard, hung the rifle
N25 1390  2    behind a shoulder.
N25 1390  5       The marine, hands on cheeks, rolled by his unwounded
N25 1400  4    side onto his stomach. He ceased weeping.
N25 1410  1       Matsuo walked toward his tree, once glancing back.
N25 1410  8    The marine was still. He would soon die.
N25 1420  5       As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking
N25 1430  3    his feet against the trunk, a mood of gloom immersed
N25 1430 13    him like a jungle shadow. What now? In the jungle,
N25 1440  9    birds were mute, while insects preserved only the monotony
N25 1450  6    of living.
N25 1450  8       Someone called. It was the marine: head lifted,
N25 1460  7    he strained and called. Then he astonished Matsuo by
N25 1470  4    pushing and dragging himself until he sat. He cupped
N25 1480  2    his mouth and yelled. Matsuo hustled the rifle off
N25 1480 11    his shoulder. Once and for all he'd finish this marine
N25 1490  9    who would not die. He aimed, but listened. It sounded
N25 1500  6    as if the man were calling him: "Hey, Japanese ...
N25 1510  3    hey there, Japanese". The man tilted back his head
N25 1520  2    and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container.
N25 1520 12    He performed the act twice more, and the begging in
N25 1530 10    his tone grew more distinct.
N25 1540  1       "Sake"? Matsuo called.
N25 1540  4       The marine nodded vigorously.
N25 1550  2       Matsuo laughed, slung the rifle. The marine was
N25 1560  2    a winehead. His superiors had said that all marines
N25 1560 11    were depraved.
N25 1570  1       The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest
N25 1570 11    before an idol. Remembering his own thirst, Matsuo
N25 1580  8    took out his water bottle. One swallow was all he would
N25 1590  7    have; he was very thirsty, but he must observe water
N25 1600  3    discipline. His years of campaigning had taught him
N25 1610  1    the value of water discipline.
N25 1610  6       He began to uncap the bottle, the rusty cap squealing
N25 1620  5    on its threads. Popping upright, the marine waved both
N25 1630  2    hands and shouted.
N25 1630  5       Of course it was water he really craved; down in
N25 1640  4    the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out. The
N25 1650  1    marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice
N25 1650 11    had to crack. Matsuo shook his head. He had no water
N25 1660  8    for an enemy. And when this was gone, he hadn't even
N25 1670  5    a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he
N25 1680  3    were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.
N25 1680 10       He capped the bottle and replaced it. After all,
N25 1690  7    he had less reason to desire it than the marine.
N25 1700  4       Before much longer the marine quieted down. His
N25 1710  1    head slumped. The upper part of his packet had stained
N25 1710 11    dark. "Marine. There is nothing for you", Matsuo said.
N25 1720  8    "Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion,
N25 1730  8    besides the dishonor of it. I've nothing for you".
N25 1740  5       From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders
N25 1750  4    it was plain he had resumed the weeping. He reminded
N25 1760  1    Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China.
N25 1760 11    In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform,
N25 1770 10    smudged, blood-specked, with the village burning about
N25 1780  6    him and shells exploding.
