G60 0010  1    It usually turned out well for him because either he
G60 0010 11    liked the right people or there were only a few wrong
G60 0020  9    people in the town. Alfred wanted to invest in my father's
G60 0030  6    hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place.
G60 0040  4    It was a very tempting offer. My father would have
G60 0040 14    done it if it hadn't been for my mother, who had a
G60 0050 12    fear of being in debt to anyone- even Alfred Alpert.
G60 0060  6       In spite of his being well liked there were a few
G60 0070  6    people who were very careful about Alfred. They had
G60 0075  3    my mother's opinion of him: that he was too sharp or
G60 0080 10    a little too good to be true. One of the people who
G60 0090 11    was afraid of Alfred was his own brother, Lew. I don't
G60 0100  8    know how and I don't know why but the two stores, the
G60 0110  6    one in Margaretville and the one in Fleischmanns that
G60 0120  2    had been set up as a partnership, were dissolved, separated
G60 0130  1    from each other. Everything was all very friendly,
G60 0130  9    except when it came to Harry, the youngest brother.
G60 0140  6    Alfred, who was a good deal older than Harry, had treated
G60 0150  5    him like a son, and when Harry decided to stay in business
G60 0160  3    with Lew instead of going with Alfred, Alfred looked
G60 0170  1    on the decision as a betrayal. From that day on he
G60 0170 12    never spoke to Harry or to Lew, or to Lew's two boys,
G60 0180  9    Mort and Jimmy. The six miles between the towns became
G60 0190  6    an ocean and the Alperts became a family of strangers.
G60 0200  3       Time went on and everybody got older. I became fifteen,
G60 0210  2    sixteen, then twenty, and still Tessie Alpert sat on
G60 0210 11    the porch with a rose in her hair, and Alfred got richer
G60 0220 12    and sicker with diabetes. It was in the spring of the
G60 0230  9    year when he took to his bed and Tessie and Alfred
G60 0240  4    found out that they didn't know each other. They were
G60 0250  2    like two strangers. The store was their marriage, and
G60 0250 11    when Alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold
G60 0260 11    them together. Tessie, everybody thought, was a strong
G60 0270  6    woman, but she was only strong because she had Alfred
G60 0280  4    to lean on. And when Alfred was forced into his bed,
G60 0290  2    Tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at
G60 0290 13    home, rocking in her rocker in the living room, staring
G60 0300  9    out the window- the rose still in her hair. Tessie
G60 0310  6    could do nothing for Alfred. She couldn't cook or clean
G60 0320  4    or make him comfortable. Instead she waited for Alfred
G60 0330  1    to get better and take care of her.
G60 0330  9       Spring was life- and Alfred Alpert in his sickroom
G60 0340  6    was death. Alfred knew that, too. I remember him pointing
G60 0350  5    out of the window and saying that he wished he could
G60 0360  2    live to see another spring but that he wouldn't.
G60 0360 11       Alfred began to put his affairs in order, and he
G60 0370 10    went about it like a man putting his things into storage.
G60 0380  6    My father, who liked Alfred very much, was a constant
G60 0390  4    visitor. One day Alfred told him that he had decided
G60 0400  1    to leave everything to me. My father, a wise man, asked
G60 0400 12    him not to. He knew Alfred liked me; if he wanted to
G60 0410 11    leave me something let it be a trinket, nothing else.
G60 0420  7    By leaving me everything he wouldn't be doing me a
G60 0430  5    favor, my father told him, and he didn't want to see
G60 0440  1    his daughter involved in a lawsuit. He didn't want
G60 0440 10    Alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would
G60 0450  8    be, and Alfred understood.
G60 0460  1       Alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home.
G60 0460 12    The doctor wanted him in a hospital; the nearest one
G60 0470  9    was forty miles away in Kingston. The day Alfred left
G60 0480  7    his home and Fleischmanns he gave up the convictions
G60 0490  4    of a lifetime. He sent me for Meltzer the Butcher,
G60 0500  1    whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi.
G60 0500 12       Meltzer knew why I had come for him. Solemnly he
G60 0510  9    walked me back to Alfred's house without a word passing
G60 0520  6    between us. He entered the house in silence, walked
G60 0530  2    into Alfred's room, and closed the door behind him.
G60 0530 11    I sat down to wait, and I watched Tessie Alpert, who
G60 0540 11    hadn't moved or said a word but kept staring out of
G60 0550 10    the window.
G60 0550 12       For a few minutes there was nothing to hear. Then
G60 0560  7    Meltzer's voice, quiet, calm, strong, started the Kaddish,
G60 0570  5    the prayer for the dead. I could hear Alfred's voice
G60 0580  3    a few words behind Meltzer's like a counterpoint, punctuated
G60 0590  2    by sobs of sorrow and resignation. There was a finality
G60 0600  1    in the rhythm of the prayer- it was the end of a life,
G60 0600 14    the end of hope, and the wondering if there would ever
G60 0610  8    be another beginning.
G60 0620  1       Meltzer stayed with Alfred, and when the door opened
G60 0620 10    they both came out. Alfred was dressed for his trip
G60 0630  8    to the hospital. The car was waiting for him. Alfred,
G60 0640  5    leaning on Meltzer, stopped for a minute to look at
G60 0650  3    Tessie. She didn't turn away from the window. Alfred
G60 0650 12    nodded a little nod and went out through the door.
G60 0660 10       Outside, his brother Harry was waiting for him-
G60 0670  6    he had come to say good-bye. Alfred walked past him
G60 0680  4    without a word and got into the car. Harry ran to the
G60 0690  2    side of the car where Alfred was sitting and looked
G60 0690 12    at him, begging him to speak. Alfred looked straight
G60 0700  7    ahead. The car began to move and Harry ran after it
G60 0710  6    crying, "Alfred! Alfred! Speak to me". But the car
G60 0720  4    moved off and Alfred just looked straight ahead. Harry
G60 0730  1    followed the car until it reached the main road and
G60 0730 11    turned towards Kingston. He stood there watching until
G60 0740  7    it had gone from his sight.
G60 0750  1       I went to visit Alfred in the Kingston Hospital
G60 0750 10    a few times. The first time I went there he asked me
G60 0760 10    to bring him water from Flagler's well- water that
G60 0770  5    reminded him of his first days in the mountains- and
G60 0780  2    before I came the next time I filled a five-gallon
G60 0790  1    jug for him and brought it to the hospital. I don't
G60 0790 12    think he ever got to drink any of it.
G60 0800  7       The jug stayed at the hospital and the water- what
G60 0810  2    can happen to water?- it evaporated, disappeared, and
G60 0820  1    came back to the earth as rain- maybe for another well
G60 0820 12    or another stream or another Alfred Alpert.
G60 0830  6    #12 "WHERE IS IT WRITTEN"?#
G60 0840  1    Mr. Banks was always called Banks the Butcher until
G60 0840 10    he left town and the shop passed over to Meltzer the
G60 0850 10    Scholar who then became automatically Meltzer the Butcher.
G60 0860  5    Meltzer was a boarder with the Banks family. He came
G60 0870  5    to Fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought
G60 0880  2    him to America from Russia. He was a learned man and
G60 0880 13    a very gentle soul. He was filled with knowledge of
G60 0890  9    the Bible and the Talmud. He knew the whyfores and
G60 0900  6    the wherefores but he was weak, very weak, on the therefores.
G60 0910  4    Banks the Butcher took Meltzer the Scholar as an apprentice
G60 0920  4    and he made it very clear that a man of learning must
G60 0930  1    be able to do more than just quote the Commentaries
G60 0930 11    of the Talmud in order to live. So Meltzer learned
G60 0940  7    a new trade from Banks, who supplied the town and the
G60 0950  5    hotels with meat.
G60 0950  8       Banks had a family- a wife, a daughter, and a son.
G60 0970  8    The daughter, Lilly, was a very good friend of mine
G60 0980  4    and I always had hopes that someday she and Meltzer
G60 0980 14    would find each other. They lived in the same house
G60 0990 10    and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do, but
G60 1010  5    the sad realities of Lilly's life and the fact that
G60 1020  5    Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful
G60 1030  1    thinking.
G60 1030  2       Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard father,
G60 1040  2    a man who didn't seem to know the difference between
G60 1040 12    the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses
G60 1050  9    of his stock in trade. He treated both with equal indifference
G60 1060  7    and with equal contempt; perhaps he was a little more
G60 1070  7    sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently
G60 1080  3    from his hooks.
G60 1080  6       Lilly Banks and I became friends. She was the opposite
G60 1090  5    of everything she should have been- a positive pole
G60 1100  2    in a negative home, a living reaction of warmth and
G60 1100 12    kindness to the harsh reality of her father. And Lilly's
G60 1110 10    whole family seemed to be an apology for Mr. Banks.
G60 1120  8    Her brother Karl was a very gentle soul, her mother
G60 1130  4    was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard,
G60 1140  1    probing eyes. For every rude word of Mr. Banks's the
G60 1140 11    family had five in apology.
G60 1150  5       Every chance I got I left the hotel to visit Lilly.
G60 1160  3    I was free but she was bound to her duties that not
G60 1160 15    even the coming of Meltzer lightened. She had to clean
G60 1170 10    the glass on the display cases in the butcher shop,
G60 1180  7    help her brother scrub the cutting tables with wire
G60 1190  4    brushes, mop the floors, put down new sawdust on the
G60 1200  1    floors and help check the outgoing orders. When these
G60 1200 10    chores were finished, only then, was she allowed whatever
G60 1210  8    freedom she could find.
G60 1220  1       I helped Lilly in the store. To me it was a game,
G60 1220 13    to her it was the deadly seriousness of life. I wanted
G60 1230  9    to help so that we could find time to play. And Lilly
G60 1240  7    allowed me to help so that she could have her few little
G60 1250  5    hours of escape.
G60 1250  8       When the work was finished, we would walk. The road
G60 1260  6    past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream.
G60 1270  4    It ran north, away from the town and the people, through
G60 1280  1    woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard.
G60 1280  9       Lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk. I would
G60 1290  8    have liked the town and the busyness of its people
G60 1300  5    but I always followed Lilly into the peace of the silent
G60 1310  3    and unstaring road.
G60 1310  6       It wasn't hard to understand. To me Lilly was a
G60 1320  6    fine and lovely girl. To people who didn't know her
G60 1330  2    she was a gawky, badly dressed kid whose arms were
G60 1330 12    too long, whose legs were a little too bony. She had
G60 1340  9    the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that reminded
G60 1350  4    me of a string of beads strolling down the street.
G60 1360  2    And she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked.
G60 1360 12    It was unexpected, unexpected because Lilly walked
G60 1370  6    with her head bent down, down, and her mark of friendship
G60 1380  7    was to look into your face. I accepted her crossed
G60 1390  3    eyes as she accepted my childishness; childishness
G60 1390 10    compared to her grown-up understanding that life was
G60 1400  9    a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins. We were almost
G60 1410  7    the same age, she was fifteen, I was twelve, and where
G60 1420  6    I felt there was a life to look forward to Lilly felt
G60 1430  2    she had had as much of it as was necessary.
G60 1430 12       When we went for our walks Lilly's brother would
G60 1440  8    come along every once in a while. Karl was an almost
G60 1450  7    exact copy of his father physically and it was strange
G60 1460  3    to see the expected become the unexpected. This huge
G60 1460 12    hulk played the guitar and he would take it along on
G60 1470 11    our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods
G60 1480 10    or by the stream. Karl played well and his favorite
G60 1490  4    song was a Schubert lullaby. He spoke no German but
G60 1500  2    he could sing it and the words of the song were the
G60 1500 14    only ones he knew in a foreign language. The song,
G60 1510  7    he said, was called "The Stream's Lullaby", and when
G60 1520  4    he sang, "Gute ruh, Gute ruh, Mach't die augen zu"
G60 1530  4    there was such longing and such simple sadness that
G60 1540  1    it frightened me. Later, when I was older, I found
G60 1540 11    the song was part of Schubert's Die Scho^ne Mu^llerin.
G60 1550  6    And even hearing it in a concert hall surrounded by
G60 1560  8    hundreds of people the words and the melody would make
G60 1570  5    me a little colder and I would reach out for my husband's
G60 1580  2    hand.
G60 1580  3       The brother and sister seemed to be a sort of mutual-aid
G60 1590  4    society, a little fortress of kindness for each other
G60 1590 13    in a hard world. I felt very flattered to be included
G60 1600 11    in the protection of their company even though I had
G60 1610  8    nothing to be protected from.
