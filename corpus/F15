F15 0010  1    IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N. Y., in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital
F15 0020  1    presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum
F15 0020  8    to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign
F15 0030  7    from the hospital staff. Three agreed, but four declined
F15 0040  6    and were suspended. After a flood of protests, they
F15 0050  3    were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace
F15 0060  1    of the community was badly disturbed, and people across
F15 0070  7    the nation, reading of the incident, felt uneasy.
F15 0080  4       In New York City in 1958, the city's Commissioner
F15 0090  2    of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide
F15 0100  1    a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He
F15 0100  9    thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving
F15 0110  5    Protestants, Jews and Roman Catholics that continued
F15 0120  4    for two months, until the city's Board of Hospitals
F15 0130  3    lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.
F15 0130 10       A year later in Albany, N. Y., a Roman Catholic
F15 0140  9    hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his
F15 0150  6    connection with the Planned Parenthood Association.
F15 0160  2    Immediately, the religious groups of the city were
F15 0170  1    embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion
F15 0170 10    of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and
F15 0180  8    conscience.
F15 0180  9       These incidents, typical of many others, dramatize
F15 0190  6    the distressing fact that no controversy during the
F15 0200  4    last several decades has caused more tension, rancor
F15 0210  2    and strife among religious groups in this country than
F15 0210 11    the birth-control issue. It has flared up periodically
F15 0220  7    on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided
F15 0230  5    over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals
F15 0240  3    and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted
F15 0250  1    on the national level in the matter of including birth-control
F15 0260  1    information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped
F15 0260  9    countries. Where it is not actually erupting, it rumbles
F15 0270  8    and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano, ready
F15 0280  5    to explode at any moment.
F15 0280 10       The time has come for citizens of all faiths to
F15 0290 10    unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome
F15 0300  5    issue from the political and social life of our nation.
F15 0310  4       The first step toward the goal is the establishment
F15 0320  1    of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly
F15 0320 11    communication on other than the polemical level. Instead
F15 0330  8    of emotional recrimination, loaded phrases and sloganeering,
F15 0340  5    we need a dispassionate study of the facts, a better
F15 0350  6    understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more
F15 0360  1    serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until
F15 0360 10    a solution is reached.
F15 0370  2       "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara, managing
F15 0380  2    editor of Commonweal, "Catholics run roughshod over
F15 0390  1    Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure
F15 0390  8    to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position
F15 0400  6    and, particularly, by their jibes at the fact that
F15 0410  6    Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in
F15 0420  2    recent decades". All too often our language is unduly
F15 0425  1    harsh.
F15 0430  1       The second step is to recognize the substantial
F15 0430  9    agreement- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate
F15 0440  7    newspaper reporting- already existing between Catholics
F15 0450  7    and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives
F15 0460  4    of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being obliged
F15 0470  2    or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number
F15 0480  1    of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal
F15 0480 10    of responsible parenthood is stressed. Family planning
F15 0490  6    is encouraged, so that parents will be able to provide
F15 0500  6    properly for their offspring.
F15 0500 10       Pope Pius XII declared in 1951 that it is possible
F15 0510 10    to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood
F15 0520  6    for a long time and even for the whole duration of
F15 0530  4    married life, if there are serious reasons, such as
F15 0540  1    those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic,
F15 0540 10    economic and social "indications". This means that
F15 0550  6    such factors as the health of the parents, particularly
F15 0560  5    the mother, their ability to provide their children
F15 0570  2    with the necessities of life, the degree of population
F15 0570 11    density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities
F15 0580 10    may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining
F15 0590  7    the number of offspring.
F15 0600  1       These are substantially the same factors considered
F15 0600  8    by non-Catholics in family planning. The laws of many
F15 0610  8    states permit birth control only for medical reasons.
F15 0620  5    The Roman Catholic Church, however, sanctions a much
F15 0630  4    more liberal policy on family planning.
F15 0630 10       Catholics, Protestants and Jews are in agreement
F15 0640  7    over the objectives of family planning, but disagree
F15 0650  5    over the methods to be used. The Roman Catholic Church
F15 0660  3    sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also
F15 0670  1    known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The
F15 0670 12    Church considers this to be the method provided by
F15 0680  8    nature and its divine Author: It involves no frustration
F15 0690  5    of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent and disciplined
F15 0700  3    use of them. With the exception of the Roman Catholic
F15 0710  2    and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make
F15 0710 10    no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical
F15 0720  7    or chemical contraceptives, allowing the couple free
F15 0730  5    choice.
F15 0730  6       Here is a difference in theological belief where
F15 0740  4    there seems little chance of agreement. The grounds
F15 0750  2    for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),
F15 0760  1    the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early
F15 0760 11    Church, the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries,
F15 0770  6    the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority
F15 0780  3    and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent role
F15 0790  2    in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,
F15 0800  1    entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical
F15 0800  9    character of birth-prevention methods.
F15 0810  4       The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards
F15 0820  2    as self-evident that the primary objective purpose
F15 0820 10    of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering
F15 0830 10    of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary
F15 0840  8    and subjective end. This conclusion is based on two
F15 0850  5    propositions: that man by the use of his reason can
F15 0860  2    ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God
F15 0860 11    makes known His purpose by certain "given" physical
F15 0870  7    arrangements.
F15 0880  1       Thus, man can readily deduce that the primary objective
F15 0880  9    end of the conjugal act is procreation, the propagation
F15 0890  6    of the race. Moreover, man may not supplant or frustrate
F15 0900  6    the physical arrangements established by God, who through
F15 0910  4    the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for
F15 0920  1    the control of conception. Believing that God is the
F15 0920 10    Author of this law and of all laws of nature, Roman
F15 0930  9    Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those
F15 0940  5    laws, not frustrate or mock them.
F15 0940 11       Let it be granted then that the theological differences
F15 0950  9    in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics
F15 0960  5    appear to be irreconcilable. But people differ in their
F15 0970  5    religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without taking
F15 0980  2    up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is
F15 0980 12    it so different in regard to birth control? It is because
F15 0990 11    each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological
F15 1000  7    belief through legislation and thus indirectly force
F15 1010  5    its belief, or at least the practical consequences
F15 1020  2    thereof, upon others.
F15 1020  5       It is always a temptation for a religious organization,
F15 1030  5    especially a powerful or dominant one, to impose through
F15 1040  5    the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint
F15 1050  1    upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have
F15 1050  9    succumbed to this temptation in the past.
F15 1060  7       Consider what happened during World War I, when
F15 1070  5    the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition
F15 1080  2    law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe
F15 1090  1    that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree
F15 1090 13    is intrinsically evil and sinful. With over four million
F15 1100  8    American men away at war, Protestants forced their
F15 1110  3    distinctive theological belief upon the general public.
F15 1120  2    With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent
F15 1120 12    that the belief was not shared by the great majority
F15 1130 10    of citizens. The attempt to enforce that belief ushered
F15 1140  6    in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, hijackers and
F15 1150  3    gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled
F15 1160  1    in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came
F15 1160 10    to an inglorious end.
F15 1170  3       That tumultuous, painful and costly experience shows
F15 1180  2    clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot
F15 1180 11    be enforced when it has little correspondence with
F15 1190  7    the general view of society. That experience holds
F15 1200  4    a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today.
F15 1210  2       Up to the turn of the century, contraception was
F15 1210 11    condemned by all Christian churches as immoral, unnatural
F15 1220  8    and contrary to divine law. This was generally reflected
F15 1230  8    in the civil laws of Christian countries. Today, the
F15 1240  4    Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually
F15 1250  3    alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth
F15 1260  1    Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror
F15 1260  7    the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants
F15 1270  8    generally.
F15 1280  1       In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908
F15 1280  9    condemnation of contraception and issued "an emphatic
F15 1290  5    warning against the use of unnatural means for the
F15 1300  4    avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-
F15 1310  3    physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and
F15 1310 10    against the evils which the extension of such use threaten
F15 1320 10    the race". Denouncing the view that the sexual union
F15 1330  7    is an end in itself, the Conference declared: "We steadfastly
F15 1340  4    uphold what must always be regarded as the governing
F15 1350  4    considerations of Christian marriage. One is the primary
F15 1360  2    purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance
F15 1370  1    of the race through the gift and heritage of children;
F15 1370 11    the other is the paramount importance in married life
F15 1380  7    of deliberate and thoughtful self-control". The Conference
F15 1390  5    called for a vigorous campaign against the open or
F15 1400  4    secret sale of contraceptives.
F15 1400  8       In 1930, the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the
F15 1410  5    primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of
F15 1420  4    children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,
F15 1430  1    contraception might be morally legitimate.
F15 1430  6       In 1958, the Conference endorsed birth control as
F15 1440  7    the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere.
F15 1450  5       Many other Protestant denominations preceded the
F15 1460  3    Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out of
F15 1470  2    28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of
F15 1470 12    Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control.
F15 1480  6    "As to the necessity", the committee declared, "for
F15 1490  5    some form of effective control of the size of the family
F15 1500  5    and the spacing of children, and consequently of control
F15 1510  1    of conception, there can be no question ... There
F15 1510 10    is general agreement also that sex union between husbands
F15 1520  7    and wives as an expression of mutual affection without
F15 1530  5    relation to procreation is right".
F15 1540  1       Since then, many Protestant denominations have made
F15 1540  8    separate pronouncements, in which they not only approved
F15 1550  8    birth control, but declared it at times to be a religious
F15 1560  8    duty. What determines the morality, they state, is
F15 1570  4    not the means used, but the motive. In general, the
F15 1580  3    means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective
F15 1580 10    are considered the most ethical.
F15 1590  5       This development is reflected in the action taken
F15 1600  4    in February, 1961, by the general board of the National
F15 1610  1    Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization
F15 1610  8    in the US. The board approved and commended the use
F15 1620  9    of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility
F15 1630  8    in family planning. It called for opposition to laws
F15 1640  6    and institutional practices restricting the information
F15 1650  3    or availability of contraceptives.
F15 1650  7       The general board declared: "Most of the Protestant
F15 1660  7    churches hold contraception and periodic continence
F15 1670  4    to be morally right when the motives are right ...
F15 1680  3    The general Protestant conviction is that motives,
F15 1680 10    rather than methods, form the primary moral issue,
F15 1690  8    provided the methods are limited to the prevention
F15 1700  5    of conception".
F15 1700  7       An action once universally condemned by all Christian
F15 1710  5    churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not
F15 1720  5    only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant
F15 1730  1    denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to
F15 1730  9    be a positive religious duty. This viewpoint has now
F15 1740  7    been translated into action by the majority of people
F15 1750  7    in this country. Repeated polls have disclosed that
F15 1760  3    most married couples are now using contraceptives in
F15 1760 11    the practice of birth control.
F15 1770  5       For all concerned with social-welfare legislation,
F15 1780  2    the significance of this radical and revolutionary
F15 1790  1    change in the thought and habits of the vast majority
F15 1790 11    of the American people is clear, profound and far-reaching.
F15 1800  8    To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction
F15 1810  5    of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to
F15 1820  5    invite the same breakdown of law and order that was
F15 1830  1    occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.
F15 1830  8       This brings us to the fact that the realities we
F15 1840  9    are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation,
F15 1850  6    but in the realm of conscience and religion: They are
F15 1860  3    moral judgments and matters of theological belief.
F15 1870  1    Conscience and religion are concerned with private
F15 1870  8    sin: The civil law is concerned with public crimes.
F15 1880  7    Only confusion, failure and anarchy result when the
F15 1890  6    effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the
F15 1900  2    impossible task of policing private homes to preclude
F15 1900 10    the possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of
F15 1910  9    such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion
F15 1920  5    itself.
