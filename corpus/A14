A14 0010  1    _PHILADELPHIA, JAN. 23_
A14 0010  4       - Nick Skorich, the line coach for the football
A14 0020  2    champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to
A14 0020  9    head coach.
A14 0030  2       Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary
A14 0030 11    believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year.
A14 0040  9    He succeeds Buck Shaw, who retired at the end of last
A14 0050  8    season.
A14 0050  9       The appointment was announced at a news conference
A14 0060  6    at which Skorich said he would retain two members of
A14 0070  4    Shaw's staff- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.
A14 0080  1       Williams is a defensive coach. Gauer works with
A14 0080  9    the ends.
A14 0090  1    #CHOICE WAS EXPECTED#
A14 0090  4    The selection had been expected. Skorich was considered
A14 0100  3    the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin
A14 0110  1    permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota
A14 0110 11    Vikings, the newest National Football League entry.
A14 0120  7       Van Brocklin, the quarterback who led the Eagles
A14 0130  7    to the title, was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday.
A14 0140  4    Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection
A14 0150  2    after he had refused to reconsider his decision to
A14 0150 11    end his career as a player.
A14 0160  6       With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles are expected
A14 0170  3    to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing.
A14 0170 12    In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's
A14 0180 10    aerials.
A14 0190  1       Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced
A14 0190 10    attack- split between running and passing.
A14 0200  5    #COACH PLAYED 3 YEARS#
A14 0200  9    Skorich, who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati
A14 0210 10    University and then had a three-year professional career
A14 0220  8    as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh
A14 0230  4    Steelers.
A14 0230  5       An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948
A14 0240  6    season. He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh
A14 0250  1    Central Catholic High School in 1949. He remained there
A14 0260  1    for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic
A14 0260  9    Institute in Troy, N. Y. He was there one season before
A14 0270 11    rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach.
A14 0280  5       Four years later he resigned to take a similar job
A14 0290  5    with the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles signed him for
A14 0300  3    Shaw's staff in 1959.
A14 0300  7       Skorich began his new job auspiciously today. At
A14 0310  3    a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson
A14 0320  1    Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.
A14 0330  1       Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches
A14 0330 10    and team officials who received an engrossed copy of
A14 0340  8    an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks
A14 0350  7    shaped like a football.
A14 0360  1       With the announcement of a "special achievement
A14 0360  8    award" to William A. (Bill) Shea, the awards list was
A14 0370  9    completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth
A14 0380  6    annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter, Baseball
A14 0390  4    Writers' Association of America, at the Waldorf-Astoria
A14 0400  3    Hotel.
A14 0400  4       Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee,
A14 0410  3    will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn, the southpaw
A14 0420  3    pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves; Frank Graham,
A14 0430  1    the Journal-American sports columnist; Bill Mazeroski,
A14 0430  8    the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and
A14 0440  9    Casey Stengel, the former manager of the Yankees.
A14 0450  7       Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award.
A14 0460  6    Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees in the final
A14 0470  4    series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the
A14 0480  2    outstanding player in the 1960 world series.
A14 0480  9       Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service
A14 0490  7    to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial
A14 0500  5    Award. To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award
A14 0510  4    as the chapter's player of the year.
A14 0510 11    #SHOW FOLLOWS CEREMONIES#
A14 0520  3    A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies, which
A14 0530  2    will be followed by the show in which the writers will
A14 0530 13    lampoon baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.
A14 0540  8       The 53-year-old Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer
A14 0550  6    with a sports background, is generally recognized as
A14 0560  5    the man most responsible for the imminent return of
A14 0570  2    a National League club to New York. Named by Mayor
A14 0570 12    Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included
A14 0580  7    James A. Farley, Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea
A14 0590  7    worked relentlessly.
A14 0600  1       His goal was to obtain a National League team for
A14 0600 11    this city. The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers
A14 0610  8    to California left New York with only the Yankees.
A14 0620  5       Despite countless barriers and disappointments,
A14 0630  1    Shea moved forward. When he was unable to bring about
A14 0640  1    immediate expansion, he sought to convince another
A14 0640  8    National League club to move here.
A14 0650  5       When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid
A14 0660  2    in the formation of a third major league, the Continental,
A14 0670  1    with New York as the key franchise. The Continental
A14 0670 10    League never got off the ground, but after two years
A14 0680  9    it forced the existing majors to expand.
A14 0690  3    #FLUSHING STADIUM IN WORKS#
A14 0690  7    The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman
A14 0700  7    Payson. A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing
A14 0710  4    Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease is
A14 0720  2    signed the local club will be formally recognized by
A14 0720 11    Commissioner Ford C. Frick. Shea's efforts figure prominently
A14 0730  8    in the new stadium.
A14 0740  2       Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands
A14 0750  1    Point, L. I. Bill Jr., 20; Kathy, 15, and Patricia,
A14 0760  1    9, round out the Shea family.
A14 0760  7       Shea was born in Manhattan. He attended New York
A14 0770  4    University before switching to Georgetown University
A14 0780  1    in Washington. He played basketball there while working
A14 0780  9    toward a law degree.
A14 0790  4       Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians,
A14 0800  2    a minor league professional football team. He was the
A14 0800 11    lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National
A14 0810 10    Football League.
A14 0820  2    #@#
A14 0820  3    All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the
A14 0830  3    local National Leaguers yesterday. On Friday, Roger
A14 0830 10    Maris, the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American
A14 0840  9    League's most-valuable-player award, will meet with
A14 0850  5    Roy Hamey, the general manager. Maris is in line for
A14 0860  6    a big raise.
A14 0870  1       Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those
A14 0870 10    honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan
A14 0880  8    Golf Writers Association tonight. The dinner will be
A14 0890  6    held at the Hotel Pierre.
A14 0900  1       Palmer, golf's leading money-winner in 1960, and
A14 0900  8    Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada
A14 0910  8    Cup matches last June in Dublin. Deane Beman, the National
A14 0920  5    Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan district
A14 0930  2    champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder,
A14 0940  1    also will receive awards.
A14 0940  5       The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe
A14 0950  7    of Plainfield, N. J., and Palm Beach, Fla., for his
A14 0960  6    sponsorship of charity tournaments. Horton Smith of
A14 0970  3    Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers
A14 0980  1    Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for
A14 0980  9    his comeback following a recent illness.
A14 0990  5       The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington,
A14 1000  3    Democrat of Missouri.
A14 1010  1    #GOLF'S GOLDEN BOY#
A14 1010  4    ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure in golf over
A14 1020  4    the past twelve months. He won the Masters, the United
A14 1030  1    States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money. He
A14 1030 11    was heralded as "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated,
A14 1040  9    and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the "Professional
A14 1050  8    Athlete of the Year", a distinction that earned for
A14 1060  7    him the $10,000 diamond- studded Hickok Belt.
A14 1070  3       But he also achieved something that endeared him
A14 1080  2    to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot. A couple of
A14 1080 13    weeks ago, he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole.
A14 1090 11    It made him human. And it also stayed the hands of
A14 1100  7    thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating
A14 1110  2    the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were
A14 1110 10    driving them to despair. If such a paragon of perfection
A14 1120 10    as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege, there
A14 1130  7    was hope left for all.
A14 1140  1       It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a
A14 1140 10    yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold.
A14 1150  4    He merely became victimized by a form of athletics
A14 1160  3    that respects no one and aggravates all. The world's
A14 1170  1    best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole
A14 1170 11    of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every
A14 1180  9    intention of delivering a final crusher. He boomed
A14 1190  6    a 280-yard drive. Then the pixies and the zombies took
A14 1200  3    over while the banshees wailed in the distance.
A14 1200 11    #NO MARGIN FOR ERROR#
A14 1210  3    On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole, Arnold whipped
A14 1220  1    into his second shot. The ball went off in a majestic
A14 1220 12    arc, an out-of-bounds slice. He tried again and once
A14 1230 10    more sliced out of bounds. He hooked the next two out
A14 1240  7    of bounds on the opposite side.
A14 1250  1       "It is possible that I over-corrected", he said
A14 1250 10    ruefully. Each of the four wayward shots cost him two
A14 1260  9    strokes. So he wound up with a dozen.
A14 1270  2       "It was a nice round figure, that 12", he said as
A14 1280  1    he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.
A14 1280 10       From the standpoint of the army of duffers, however,
A14 1290  8    this was easily the most heartening exhibition they
A14 1300  3    had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during
A14 1310  2    his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open. The
A14 1310 13    idol of the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who
A14 1320  9    achieved a 19 in the United States Open. Their secondary
A14 1330  5    hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm, who drank his
A14 1340  4    lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way
A14 1350  2    out of a rock-strewn gully. Willie's partner was Long
A14 1350 12    Jim Barnes, who tried to keep count.
A14 1360  6    #STICKLER FOR RULES#
A14 1360  9    "How many is that, Jim"? asked Willie at one stage
A14 1370  9    of his excavation project.
A14 1380  1       "Thirteen", said Long Jim.
A14 1380  5       "Nae, man", said Willie, "ye must be countin' the
A14 1390  8    echoes". He had a 16.
A14 1400  1       Palmer's dozen were honestly earned. Nor were there
A14 1400  9    any rules to save him. If there had been, he would
A14 1410 10    have found a loophole, because Arnold is one golfer
A14 1420  5    who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote
A14 1430  3    the book. This knowledge has come in handy, too.
A14 1430 12       His first shot in the Open last year landed in a
A14 1440 11    brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway.
A14 1450  7    The ball floated downstream. A spectator picked up
A14 1460  3    the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped
A14 1460 14    this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.
A14 1470  9       Arnold sent for Joe Dey, the executive secretary
A14 1480  6    of the golf association. Joe naturally ruled that a
A14 1490  4    ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had
A14 1500  1    originally entered the stream.
A14 1500  5       "I knew it all along", confessed Arnold with a grin,
A14 1510  5    "but I just happened to think how much nicer it would
A14 1520  4    be to drop one way up there".
A14 1520 11       For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious
A14 1530  8    intensity, Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor
A14 1540  5    that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from
A14 1550  2    jangling like banjo strings. Yet he remains the fiercest
A14 1550 11    of competitors. He'll even bull head-on into the rules
A14 1560  9    when he is sure he's right. That's how he first won
A14 1570  8    the Masters in 1958.
A14 1580  1       It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155-yarder. Arnold's
A14 1580 11    iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding
A14 1590  8    the green, an embankment that had become soft and spongy
A14 1600  7    from the rains, thereby bringing local rules into force.
A14 1610  4    #RULING FROM ON HIGH#
A14 1610  8    "I can remove the ball, can't I"? asked Palmer of an
A14 1620  7    official.
A14 1620  8       "No", said the official. "You must play it where
A14 1630  8    it lies".
A14 1630 10       "You're wrong", said Arnold, a man who knows the
A14 1640  9    rules. "I'll do as you say, but I'll also play a provisional
A14 1650 10    ball and get a ruling".
A14 1660  1       He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the
A14 1660 13    provisional one. The golfing fathers ruled in his favor.
A14 1670  9    So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball
A14 1680  5    and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke.
A14 1690  3       Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer was
A14 1700  2    some god-like creature who had nothing in common with
A14 1700 12    the duffers. But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became
A14 1710 10    one of the boys, a bigger hero than he ever had been
A14 1720  7    before.
A14 1730  1       A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis
A14 1730 10    Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule
A14 1740  8    to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football
A14 1750  6    League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today.
A14 1760  4       Other items on the agenda during the meetings, which
A14 1770  3    are expected to continue through Saturday, concern
A14 1770 10    television, rules changes, professional football's
A14 1780  5    hall of fame, players' benefits and constitutional
A14 1790  4    amendments.
A14 1790  5       The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team
A14 1800  8    league to play a home-and-home series with teams in
A14 1810  4    its division, plus two games against teams in the other
A14 1820  1    division. However, this would require a lengthening
A14 1820  8    of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks.
A14 1830  6       Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner, pointed out:
A14 1840  3       "We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and
A14 1850  5    weather at the other".
A14 1850  9       Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks
A14 1860  6    and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates.
