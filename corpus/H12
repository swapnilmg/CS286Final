H12 0010  1    _(E)_
H12 0010  2       In addition to the penalties provided in title 18,
H12 0010 11    United States Code, section 1001, any person guilty
H12 0020  8    of any act, as provided therein, with respect to any
H12 0030  6    matter under this Title, shall forfeit all rights under
H12 0040  4    this Title, and, if payment shall have been made or
H12 0050  1    granted, the Commission shall take such action as may
H12 0050 10    be necessary to recover the same.
H12 0060  4    _(F)_
H12 0060  5       In connection with any claim decided by the Commission
H12 0070  3    pursuant to this Title in which an award is made, the
H12 0080  1    Commission may, upon the written request of the claimant
H12 0080 10    or any attorney heretofore or hereafter employed by
H12 0090  6    such claimant, determine and apportion the just and
H12 0100  5    reasonable attorney's fees for services rendered with
H12 0110  2    respect to such claim, but the total amount of the
H12 0110 12    fees so determined in any case shall not exceed 10
H12 0120  8    per centum of the total amount paid pursuant to the
H12 0130  5    award. Written evidence that the claimant and any such
H12 0140  3    attorney have agreed to the amount of the attorney's
H12 0140 12    fees shall be conclusive upon the Commission: Provided,
H12 0150  8    however, That the total amount of the fees so agreed
H12 0160  9    upon does not exceed 10 per centum of the total amount
H12 0170  6    paid pursuant to the award. Any fee so determined shall
H12 0180  2    be entered as a part of such award, and payment thereof
H12 0190  1    shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury by deducting
H12 0190 12    the amount thereof from the total amount paid pursuant
H12 0200  8    to the award. Any agreement to the contrary shall be
H12 0210  6    unlawful and void. The Commission is authorized and
H12 0220  3    directed to mail to each claimant in proceedings before
H12 0230  1    the Commission notice of the provisions of this subsection.
H12 0230 10    Whoever, in the United States or elsewhere, pays or
H12 0240  9    offers to pay, or promises to pay, or receives on account
H12 0250  7    of services rendered or to be rendered in connection
H12 0260  3    with any such claim, compensation which, when added
H12 0270  1    to any amount previously paid on account of such services,
H12 0270 11    will exceed the amount of fees so determined by the
H12 0280  9    Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and,
H12 0290  5    upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than
H12 0300  2    $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twelve months, or
H12 0300 11    both, and if any such payment shall have been made
H12 0310  9    or granted, the Commission shall take such action as
H12 0320  6    may be necessary to recover the same, and, in addition
H12 0330  2    thereto, any such person shall forfeit all rights under
H12 0330 11    this title.
H12 0340  2    _(G)_
H12 0340  3       The Attorney General shall assign such officers
H12 0350  1    and employees of the Department of Justice as may be
H12 0350 11    necessary to represent the United States as to any
H12 0360  7    claims of the Government of the United States with
H12 0370  4    respect to which the Commission has jurisdiction under
H12 0380  2    this title. Any and all payments required to be made
H12 0380 12    by the Secretary of the Treasury under this title pursuant
H12 0390  9    to any award made by the Commission to the Government
H12 0400  7    of the United States shall be covered into the Treasury
H12 0410  5    to the credit of miscellaneous receipts.
H12 0420  1    _(H)_
H12 0420  2       The Commission shall notify all claimants of the
H12 0420 10    approval or denial of their claims, stating the reasons
H12 0430  9    and grounds therefor, and if approved, shall notify
H12 0440  5    such claimants of the amount for which such claims
H12 0450  2    are approved. Any claimant whose claim is denied, or
H12 0450 11    is approved for less than the full amount of such claim,
H12 0460 10    shall be entitled, under such regulations as the Commission
H12 0470  7    may prescribe, to a hearing before the Commission,
H12 0480  4    or its duly authorized representatives, with respect
H12 0490  2    to such claim. Upon such hearing, the Commission may
H12 0490 11    affirm, modify, or revise its former action with respect
H12 0500  9    to such claim, including a denial or reduction in the
H12 0510  7    amount theretofore allowed with respect to such claim.
H12 0520  4    The action of the Commission in allowing or denying
H12 0530  1    any claim under this title shall be final and conclusive
H12 0530 11    on all questions of law and fact and not subject to
H12 0540  9    review by the Secretary of State or any other official,
H12 0550  6    department, agency, or establishment of the United
H12 0560  3    States or by any court by mandamus or otherwise.
H12 0570  1    _(I)_
H12 0570  1       The Commission may in its discretion enter an award
H12 0570 10    with respect to one or more items deemed to have been
H12 0580 10    clearly established in an individual claim while deferring
H12 0590  4    consideration and action on other items of the same
H12 0600  4    claim.
H12 0600  5    _(J)_
H12 0600  6       The Commission shall comply with the provisons of
H12 0610  2    the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 except as
H12 0610 10    otherwise specifically provided by this title.
H12 0620  6    _SEC. 5._
H12 0620  8       The Commission shall, as soon as possible, and in
H12 0630  8    the order of the making of such awards, certify to
H12 0640  4    the Secretary of the Treasury and to the Secretary
H12 0650  1    of State copies of the awards made in favor of the
H12 0650 12    Government of the United States or of nationals of
H12 0660  9    the United States under this Title. The Commission
H12 0670  4    shall certify to the Secretary of State, upon his request,
H12 0680  4    copies of the formal submissions of claims filed pursuant
H12 0690  1    to subsection (b) of section 4 of this Act for transmission
H12 0700  1    to the foreign government concerned.
H12 0710  5    _SEC. 6._
H12 0710  7       The Commission shall complete its affairs in connection
H12 0720  6    with settlement of United States-Yugoslav claims arising
H12 0730  3    under the Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 1948 not later
H12 0740  4    than December 31, 1954: Provided, That nothing in this
H12 0750  3    provision shall be construed to limit the life of the
H12 0750 13    Commission, or its authority to act on future agreements
H12 0760  9    which may be effected under the provisions of this
H12 0770  6    legislation.
H12 0770  7    _SEC. 7. (A)_
H12 0770 10       Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided,
H12 0780  6    the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed
H12 0790  5    to pay, as prescribed by section 8 of this Title, an
H12 0800  5    amount not exceeding the principal of each award, plus
H12 0810  1    accrued interests on such awards as bear interest,
H12 0810  9    certified pursuant to section 5 of this Title, in accordance
H12 0820  9    with the award. Such payments, and applications for
H12 0830  4    such payments, shall be made in accordance with such
H12 0840  3    regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
H12 0850  1    _(B)_
H12 0850  2       There shall be deducted from the amount of each
H12 0850 11    payment made pursuant to subsection (c) of section
H12 0860  8    8, as reimbursement for the expenses incurred by the
H12 0880  5    United States, an amount equal to 5 per centum of such
H12 0890  4    payment. All amounts so deducted shall be covered into
H12 0900  1    the Treasury to the credit of miscellaneous receipts.
H12 0900  9    _(C)_
H12 0900 10       Payments made pursuant to this Title shall be made
H12 0910  9    only to the person or persons on behalf of whom the
H12 0920  7    award is made, except that-
H12 0920 12    _(1)_
H12 0930  1       if such person is deceased or is under a legal disability,
H12 0930 11    payment shall be made to his legal representative:
H12 0940  7    Provided, That if the total award is not over $500
H12 0950  7    and there is no qualified executor or administrator,

H12 0980  6    with the requirements of law with respect to the administration
H12 0990  5    of estates;
H12 0990  7    _(2)_
H12 0990  8       in the case of a partnership or corporation, the
H12 1000  6    existence of which has been terminated and on behalf
H12 1010  4    of which an award is made, payment shall be made, except
H12 1020  1    as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), to the person
H12 1020 11    or persons found by the Comptroller General of the
H12 1030  7    United States to be entitled thereto;
H12 1040  2    _(3)_
H12 1040  3       if a receiver or trustee for any such partnership
H12 1050  1    or corporation has been duly appointed by a court of
H12 1050 11    competent jurisdiction in the United States and has
H12 1060  7    not been discharged prior to the date of payment, payment

H12 1120  9    award, or any part thereof, payment shall be made to
H12 1130  6    the assignee, as his interest may appear; and

H12 1190  7    General of the United States, as the case may be, shall
H12 1200  7    find that any person is entitled to any such payment,
H12 1210  2    after such payment shall have been received by such
H12 1210 11    person, it shall be an absolute bar to recovery by
H12 1220 10    any other person against the United States, its officers,
H12 1230  6    agents, or employees with respect to such payment.
H12 1240  4    _(E)_

H12 1250 12    of this Title.
H12 1260  2    _(F)_
