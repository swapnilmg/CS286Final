A42 0010  1    #THE PRESIDENCY: TALKING AND LISTENING#
A42 0010  6    Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned
A42 0020  6    with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament
A42 0030  3    adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev,
A42 0040  1    his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy
A42 0040  9    involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign
A42 0050  9    policy last week.
A42 0060  1       High up on the President's priority list was the
A42 0060 10    thorny question of Bizerte. On this issue, the President
A42 0070  8    received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador
A42 0080  6    Adlai Stevenson, who had just returned from Paris,
A42 0090  4    and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving
A42 0100  1    way- for both Paris and Tunis- out of the imbroglio.
A42 0110  1    Ideally, the President would like the French to agree
A42 0110 10    on a "status quo ante" on Bizerte, and accept a new
A42 0120  9    timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean
A42 0130  6    base. To continue their important conversations about
A42 0140  3    the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems,
A42 0150  3    Mr. Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend.
A42 0170  1       The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock
A42 0170  8    with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense
A42 0180 10    Minister Bahi Ladgham, who flew to Washington last
A42 0190  7    week to seek U.S. support. The conversation apparently
A42 0200  4    convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France
A42 0210  4    and Tunisia were not irreconcilable. Through Ladgham,
A42 0220  1    Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian
A42 0230  1    President Habib Bourguiba; and one U.S. official said:
A42 0230  9    "The key question now is which side picks up the phone
A42 0240 11    first".
A42 0250  1       On the Latin American front, the President held
A42 0250  9    talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon
A42 0260  6    before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American
A42 0270  5    Economic and Social Council (which the President himself
A42 0280  2    had originally hoped to attend). Main purpose of the
A42 0290  1    meeting: To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for
A42 0290  8    Progress.
A42 0300  1       And that was not all. In conferences with Nationalist
A42 0300 10    China's dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng,
A42 0310  7    Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that
A42 0320  7    the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission
A42 0330  8    of Red China to the United Nations. Chen was equally
A42 0340  5    adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer
A42 0350  3    Mongolia; however the President, who would like to
A42 0350 11    woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking
A42 0360  9    and Moscow, would promise Chen nothing more than an
A42 0370  7    abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission
A42 0380  3    comes to a vote.
A42 0380  7       The President also conferred with emissaries from
A42 0390  6    Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid.
A42 0400  4    To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser, his brother,
A42 0410  3    Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission
A42 0420  1    to the Ivory Coast. All week long the President clearly
A42 0420 11    was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs;
A42 0430  8    in effect, he was practicing what he preached in his
A42 0440  6    Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared: "We
A42 0450  2    shall always be prepared to discuss international problems
A42 0460  1    with any and all nations that are willing to talk,
A42 0460 11    and listen, with reason".
A42 0470  2    #CRIME: 'SKYJACKED'#
A42 0470  4    From International Airport in Los Angeles to International
A42 0480  6    Airport in Houston, as the great four-jet Boeing 707
A42 0490  6    flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes, including
A42 0500  2    stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. When
A42 0510  1    Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off
A42 0510  9    at 11:30 one night last week, there was no reason to
A42 0520  9    think it would take any longer.
A42 0530  1       The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix.
A42 0540  1    Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso,
A42 0540 12    hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers
A42 0550 12    paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who
A42 0560  9    had come aboard. At 3:58 a.m., with the plane about
A42 0570  5    twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert Berry,
A42 0580  2    a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the
A42 0590  1    man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up
A42 0590 10    the aisle toward the cockpit. "The man was bent over
A42 0600  8    with his hand on his stomach", Berry said. "I figured
A42 0610  5    he was sick".
A42 0610  8       John Salvador, a farmer from Palm Desert, Calif.,
A42 0620  6    was sitting up front and could see through the door
A42 0630  5    as the trio entered the cockpit. "The kid had a .45
A42 0640  3    automatic, like they issue in the Army", he said. "The
A42 0640 13    other fellow had a .38". Salvador saw the youth hold
A42 0650 10    his .45 against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey;
A42 0660  6    the man put his .38 at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards.
A42 0670  6       To Rickards, a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the
A42 0680  6    air, it was an old story: His plane was being hijacked
A42 0690  3    in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930,
A42 0690 14    when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor
A42 0700 10    at Arequipa. But last week's pirates, like the Cuban-American
A42 0710  8    who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra (NEWSWEEK,
A42 0720  6    Aug. 7), wanted to go to Havana.
A42 0730  4    _STALLING:_
A42 0730  5       "Tell your company there are four of us here with
A42 0750  2    guns", the elder man told Rickards. The pilot radioed
A42 0760  1    El Paso International Airport with just that message.
A42 0760  9    But, he told the "skyjackers", the 707 didn't carry
A42 0770  8    enough fuel to reach Havana; they would have to refuel
A42 0780  7    at El Paso.
A42 0780 10       Most passengers didn't know what had happened until
A42 0790  7    they got on the ground. Jerry McCauley of Sacramento,
A42 0800  5    Calif., one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board,
A42 0810  4    awoke from a nap in confusion. "The old man came from
A42 0820  3    the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers
A42 0830  1    to go to Cuba", McCauley said, "and like a nut I raised
A42 0830 13    my hand. I thought he was the Air Force recruiter".
A42 0840  9       What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer
A42 0850  7    as hostages, along with the crew. They chose four:
A42 0860  4    Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines in Houston;
A42 0870  3    Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash.; Pfc. Truman
A42 0890  2    Cleveland of St. Augustine. Fla., and Leonard Gilman,
A42 0900  1    a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration
A42 0910  1    Service Border Patrol. Everybody else was allowed to
A42 0910  9    file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso
A42 0920  9    at 4:18 a.m.
A42 0930  1       They found a large welcoming group- El Paso policemen,
A42 0930 10    Border Patrol, sheriff's deputies, and FBI men, who
A42 0940  7    surged around the plane with rifles and submarine guns.
A42 0950  7    Other FBI men, talking with the pilot from the tower,
A42 0960  6    conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to
A42 0970  3    Havana. The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707
A42 0970 12    in twenty minutes, took fully three hours. Still more
A42 0980  8    time was consumed while the pilot, at the radioed suggestion
A42 0990  7    of Continental president Robert Six, tried to persuade
A42 1000  5    the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven
A42 1010  4    Douglas DC-7.
A42 1010  7       Actually, the officers on the ground had no intention
A42 1020  7    of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of
A42 1030  4    an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight
A42 1040  1    from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did
A42 1040 10    most others, that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel
A42 1050  8    Castro who had taken over the 707. Mr. Kennedy had
A42 1060  6    been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal
A42 1070  4    the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone. At
A42 1080  1    one time, while still under the impression that he
A42 1080 10    was dealing with a Cuban plot, the President talked
A42 1090  6    about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba.
A42 1100  4       As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas
A42 1110  1    sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police
A42 1110 10    got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage
A42 1120 10    compartment. From the luggage, they learned that the
A42 1130  6    two air pirates, far from being Cubans, were native
A42 1140  3    Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden,
A42 1150  1    50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz., and his
A42 1150 11    son, Cody, 16, a high-school junior.
A42 1160  6    _TENSION_
A42 1160  7       The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens.
A42 1170  6    The father, by accident or perhaps to show, as he said,
A42 1180  4    "we mean business", took the .45 and fired a slug between
A42 1190  2    the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons. At 7:30
A42 1190 11    a.m., more than three hours after landing, the Beardens
A42 1200  9    gave an ultimatum:
A42 1210  1       Take off or see the hostages killed.
A42 1210  8       The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m.,
A42 1220 10    and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway.
A42 1230  6       Several police cars, loaded with armed officers,
A42 1240  3    raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the big
A42 1250  2    jet. The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one
A42 1250 11    of the inboard engines; the plane slowed to a halt.
A42 1260  8    Ambulances, baggage trucks, and cars surrounded it.
A42 1270  5       The day wore on. At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled
A42 1280  5    up to the plane. A few minutes later, FBI agent Francis
A42 1290  2    Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane,
A42 1290 12    unarmed. While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses
A42 1300  7    Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door.
A42 1310 10    So did hostages Casey, Cleveland, and Mullen. That
A42 1320  5    left only the four crew members, Crosby, and Border
A42 1330  3    Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens. The
A42 1340  2    elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other
A42 1340 12    in a hip pocket. Gilman started talking to him until
A42 1350  7    he saw his chance. He caught officer Simmons' eye,
A42 1360  4    nodded toward young Bearden, and- "I swung my right
A42 1370  4    as hard as I could. Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy
A42 1380  1    and it was all over".
A42 1380  6       Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m., the
A42 1390  3    Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges
A42 1400  1    of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across
A42 1400  9    state lines. (Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the
A42 1410  7    plane to Castro, and live high in Cuba.) Back home
A42 1420  5    in Coolidge, Ariz., his 36-year-old wife, Mary, said:
A42 1430  3    "I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs".
A42 1440  2    #CONGRESS: MORE MUSCLE#
A42 1440  5    Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol
A42 1460  2    Hill last week was the military strength of the nation.
A42 1470  3    The Senate put other business aside as it moved with
A42 1470 13    unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0-
A42 1480  9    the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history.
A42 1490  6       With the money all but in hand, however, the Administration
A42 1500  7    indicated that, instead of the 225,000 more men in
A42 1510  6    uniform that President Kennedy had requested, the armed
A42 1520  3    forces would be increased by only 160,000. The "hold-back",
A42 1530  1    as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a
A42 1530  9    temporary expedient intended to insure that the army
A42 1540  8    services are built up gradually and, thus, the new
A42 1550  5    funds spent prudently.
A42 1550  8       In all, the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion,
A42 1560  7    which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested
A42 1570  4    the week before by President Kennedy, but tacked on
A42 1580  3    $754 million more than the President had asked for.
A42 1580 12    (The Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional
A42 1590  9    B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic
A42 1600  7    Air Command.) The House, which had passed its smaller
A42 1610  5    appropriation before the President's urgent call for
A42 1620  3    more, was expected to go along with the increased defense
A42 1630  1    budget in short order.
A42 1630  5       In other areas, Congressional action last week included:
A42 1640  3       @ The Senate (by voice vote) and the House (by 224-170)
A42 1650  4    passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm
A42 1660  2    bill which the President is expected to sign, not too
A42 1660 12    unhappily.
A42 1670  1       @ The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance
A42 1670 10    the government's health, welfare, and labor activities.
A42 1680  6       Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill, with
A42 1700  3    its controversial long-range proposals, had just begun
A42 1710  4    on the Senate floor at the weekend. White House legislative
A42 1720  2    aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.
A42 1730  1    #FOOD: STEW A LA MULLIGATAWNY#
A42 1730  6    Most members of the U.S. Senate, because they are human,
A42 1740  5    like to eat as high on the hog as they can. But, because
A42 1750  4    they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth
A42 1760  1    as the lowliest voter. As a result, ever since 1851
A42 1760 11    when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of
A42 1770  8    the Capitol Building, the senators have never ceased
A42 1780  4    to grumble about the food- even while they opposed
A42 1790  2    every move that might improve it.
A42 1790  8       Over the years, enlivened chiefly by disputes about
A42 1800  5    the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes, the
A42 1810  3    menu has pursued its drab all-American course. Individual
A42 1820  1    senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally
A42 1820 11    introduced smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from
A42 1830  8    Maryland, oysters from Washington, grapefruit from
A42 1840  5    Florida. But plain old bean soup, served daily since
A42 1860  2    the turn of the century (at the insistence of the late
A42 1870  2    Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho), made clear to the citizenry
A42 1870 12    that the Senate's stomach was in the right place.
A42 1880  9       In a daring stroke, the Senate ventured forth last
A42 1890  7    week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year
A42 1900  8    French-born maitre d'hotel.
