G71 0010  1    For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is
G71 0010  9    a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and
G71 0020  4    restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished
G71 0030  3    image of the species Man, or, as Malraux himself puts
G71 0040  1    it, "to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore
G71 0040 11    in themselves".
G71 0050  1    #I#
G71 0050  2    Andre Malraux's The Walnut Trees of Altenburg was written
G71 0060  3    in the early years of the second World War, during
G71 0070  1    a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner
G71 0070 11    by the Germans after the fall of France. The manuscript,
G71 0080  8    presumably after being smuggled out of the country,
G71 0090  6    was published in Switzerland in 1943. The work as it
G71 0100  5    stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at
G71 0100 15    that time- it is only the first section of a three-part
G71 0110 11    novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange; and this first section
G71 0120  9    was somehow preserved (there are always these annoying
G71 0130  6    little mysteries about the actual facts of Malraux's
G71 0140  4    life) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest. If we are
G71 0150  4    to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux's
G71 0150 13    latest book, La Metamorphose des Dieux, Vol. I (1957),
G71 0160  9    he is still engaged in writing a large novel under
G71 0180  8    his original title. But as he remarks in his preface
G71 0190  5    to The Walnut Trees, "a novel can hardly ever be rewritten",
G71 0200  4    and "when this one appears in its final form, the form
G71 0210  3    of the first part ... will no doubt be radically changed".
G71 0220  1    Malraux pretends, perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious
G71 0220 10    a modesty, that his fragmentary work will accordingly
G71 0230  7    "appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophiles" and
G71 0250  2    "to connoisseurs of what might have been". Even in
G71 0260  4    its present form, however, the first part of Malraux's
G71 0270  1    unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of
G71 0270  9    mid-twentieth century literature; and it should be
G71 0280  7    far better known than it is.
G71 0290  1       The theme of The Walnut Trees of Altenburg is most
G71 0290 11    closely related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux's
G71 0300  8    array of novels: Man's Hope (1937). This magnificent
G71 0310  6    but greatly underestimated book, which bodies forth
G71 0320  5    the very form and pressure of its time as no other
G71 0330  4    comparable creation, has suffered severely from having
G71 0340  1    been written about an historical event- the Spanish
G71 0340  9    Civil War- that is still capable of fanning the smoldering
G71 0350  9    fires of old political feuds. Even so apparently impartial
G71 0360  6    a critic as W. H. Frohock has taken for granted that
G71 0370  6    the book was originally intended as a piece of Loyalist
G71 0380  3    propaganda; and has then gone on to argue, with unimpeachable
G71 0390  1    consistency, that all the obviously non-propagandistic
G71 0390  8    aspects of the book are simply inadvertent "contradictions".
G71 0400  8       Nothing, however, could be farther from the truth.
G71 0410  8    The whole purpose of Man's Hope is to portray the tragic
G71 0420  8    dialectic between means and ends inherent in all organized
G71 0430  6    political violence- and even when such violence is
G71 0440  3    a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty,
G71 0440 11    justice and human dignity. Nowhere before in Malraux's
G71 0450  8    pages have we met such impassioned defenders of a "quality
G71 0460  8    of man" which transcends the realm of politics and
G71 0470  6    even the realm of action altogether- both the action
G71 0480  4    of Malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like Perken
G71 0490  1    and Garine, and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated
G71 0490 10    Communists like Kyo Gisors and Katow in Man's Fate.
G71 0500  9    "Man engages only a small part of himself in an action"
G71 0510 10    says old Alvear the art-historian; "and the more the
G71 0520  5    action claims to be total, the smaller is the part
G71 0530  4    of man engaged". These lines never cease to haunt the
G71 0540  2    book amidst all the exaltations of combat, and to make
G71 0540 12    an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community
G71 0550  8    than one based on the brutal necessities of war.
G71 0560  4       It is this larger theme of the "quality of man",
G71 0570  3    a quality that transcends the ideological and flows
G71 0570 11    into "the human", which now forms the pulsating heart
G71 0580  9    of Malraux's artistic universe. Malraux, to be sure,
G71 0590  7    does not abandon the world of violence, combat and
G71 0600  5    sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative
G71 0610  3    artist, and which is the only world, apparently, in
G71 0610 12    which his imagination can flame into life. The Walnut
G71 0620  9    Trees of Altenburg includes not one war but two, and
G71 0630  8    throws in a Turkish revolution along with some guerrilla
G71 0640  5    fighting in the desert for good measure. But while
G71 0650  2    war still serves as a catalyst for the values that
G71 0650 12    Malraux wishes to express, these values are no longer
G71 0660  8    linked with the triumph or defeat of any cause- whether
G71 0670  6    that of an individual assertion of the will-to-power,
G71 0680  4    or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation
G71 0690  1    of oppression- as their necessary condition. On the
G71 0690  9    contrary, the frenzy and furor of combat is only the
G71 0700  9    sombre foil against which the sudden illuminations
G71 0710  3    of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance
G71 0720  1    of a Caravaggio.
G71 0720  4    #II#
G71 0720  5    The Walnut Trees of Altenburg is composed in the form
G71 0730  6    of a triptych, with the two small side panels framing
G71 0740  2    and enclosing the main central episode of the novel.
G71 0740 11    This central episode consists of a series of staccato
G71 0750  9    scenes set in the period from the beginning of the
G71 0760  6    present century up to the first World War. The framing
G71 0770  3    scenes, on the other hand, both take place in the late
G71 0780  1    Spring of 1940, just at the moment of the defeat of
G71 0780 12    France in the second great world conflict. The narrator
G71 0790  7    is an Alsatian serving with the French Army, and he
G71 0800  6    has the same name (Berger) that Malraux himself was
G71 0810  3    later to use in the Resistance; like Malraux he was
G71 0810 13    also serving in the tank corps before being captured,
G71 0820  9    and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been
G71 0830  8    a writer. These biographical analogies are obvious,
G71 0840  3    and far too much time has been spent speculating on
G71 0850  2    their possible implications.
G71 0850  5       Much more important is to grasp the feelings of
G71 0860  4    the narrator (whose full name is never given) as he
G71 0870  1    becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass
G71 0870  9    of French prisoners clustered together in a temporary
G71 0880  6    prison camp in and around the cathedral of Chartres.
G71 0890  3    For as his companions gradually dissolve back into
G71 0900  2    a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity,
G71 0900 10    as they lose all the appanage of their acquired culture,
G71 0910  9    he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being
G71 0920  9    confronted with the essence of mankind. "As a writer,
G71 0930  4    by what have I been obsessed these last ten years,
G71 0940  2    if not by mankind? Here I am face to face with the
G71 0940 14    primeval stuff".
G71 0950  2       The intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening
G71 0960  1    pages is of crucial importance for understanding the
G71 0960  9    remainder of the text; and we must attend to it more
G71 0970 10    closely than has usually been done. What does the narrator
G71 0980  6    see and what does he feel? A good many pages of the
G71 0990  4    first section are taken up with an account of the dogged
G71 1000  1    determination of the prisoners to write to their wives
G71 1000 10    and families- even when it becomes clear that the Germans
G71 1010 11    are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the
G71 1020  8    wind. Awkwardly and laboriously, in stiff, unemotional
G71 1030  2    phrases, the soldiers continue to bridge the distance
G71 1040  1    between themselves and those they love; they instinctively
G71 1040  9    struggle to keep open a road to the future in their
G71 1050 11    hearts. And by a skillful and unobtrusive use of imagery
G71 1060  6    (the enclosure is called a "Roman-camp stockade", the
G71 1070  3    hastily erected lean-to is a "Babylonian hovel", the
G71 1080  2    men begin to look like "Peruvian mummies" and to acquire
G71 1090  1    "Gothic faces"), Malraux projects a fresco of human
G71 1090  9    endurance- which is also the endurance of the human-
G71 1100 11    stretching backward into the dark abyss of time. The
G71 1110  7    narrator feels himself catching a glimpse of pre-history,
G71 1120  4    learning of man's "age-old familiarity with misfortune",
G71 1130  1    as well as his "equally age-old ingenuity, his secret
G71 1140  1    faith in endurance, however crammed with catastrophes,
G71 1140  8    the same faith perhaps as the cave-men used to have
G71 1150  9    in the face of famine".
G71 1160  1       This new vision of man that the narrator acquires
G71 1160 10    is also accompanied by a re-vision of his previous
G71 1170  8    view. "I thought I knew more than my education had
G71 1180  4    taught me" notes the narrator, "because I had encountered
G71 1190  1    the militant mobs of a political or religious faith".
G71 1190 10    Is this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier
G71 1200 10    infatuation with the ideological? But now he knows
G71 1210  7    "that an intellectual is not only a man to whom books
G71 1220  6    are necessary, he is any man whose reasoning, however
G71 1230  2    elementary it may be, affects and directs his life".
G71 1230 11    From this point of view the "militant mobs" of the
G71 1240  9    past, stirred into action by one ideology or another,
G71 1250  6    were all composed of "intellectuals"- and this is not
G71 1260  7    the level on which the essence of mankind can be discovered.
G71 1270  2    The men around him, observes the narrator, "have been
G71 1280  1    living from day to day for thousands of years". The
G71 1280 11    human is deeper than a mass ideology, certainly deeper
G71 1290  7    than the isolated individual; and the narrator recalls
G71 1300  5    the words of his father, Vincent Berger: "It is not
G71 1310  4    by any amount of scratching at the individual that
G71 1310 13    one finally comes down to mankind".
G71 1320  6       The entire middle section of The Walnut Trees is
G71 1330  6    taken up with the life of Vincent Berger himself, whose
G71 1340  3    fragmentary notes on his "encounters with mankind"
G71 1350  1    are now conveyed by his son. "He was not much older
G71 1350 12    than myself" writes the narrator, "when he began to
G71 1360  8    feel the impact of that human mystery which now obsesses
G71 1370  5    me, and which makes me begin, perhaps, to understand
G71 1380  3    him". For the figure of Vincent Berger Malraux has
G71 1390  1    obviously drawn on his studies of T. E. Lawrence (though
G71 1390 11    Berger fights on the side of the Turks instead of against
G71 1400 11    them), and like both Lawrence and Malraux himself he
G71 1410  7    is a fervent admirer of Nietzsche. A professor at the
G71 1420  5    University of Constantinople, where his first course
G71 1430  2    of lectures was on Nietzsche and the "philosophy of
G71 1430 11    action", Vincent Berger becomes head of the propaganda
G71 1440  8    department of the German Embassy in Turkey. As an Alsatian
G71 1450  8    before the first World War he was of course of German
G71 1460  8    nationality; but he quickly involves himself in the
G71 1470  4    Young Turk revolutionary movement to such an extent
G71 1480  1    that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism.
G71 1480 10    And, after becoming the right-hand man of Enver Pasha,
G71 1490  8    he is sent by the latter to pave the way for a new
G71 1500  8    Turkish Empire embracing "the union of all Turks throughout
G71 1510  3    Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases on
G71 1520  2    the Silk Trade Route".
G71 1520  6       Vincent Berger's mission is a failure because the
G71 1530  6    Ottoman nationalism on which Enver Pasha counted does
G71 1540  3    not exist. Central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from
G71 1540 13    which nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation
G71 1550 10    in which nothing human any longer seemed to survive,
G71 1560  7    Vincent Berger begins to dream of the Occident. "Oh
G71 1570  5    for the green of Europe! Trains whistling in the night,
G71 1580  4    the rattle and clatter of cabs ...". Finally, after
G71 1590  1    almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could
G71 1590 11    not fight back because madmen are sacred to Islam-
G71 1600  7    he throws up his mission and returns to Europe. This
G71 1610  5    has been his first encounter with mankind, and, although
G71 1620  2    he has now become a legendary figure in the popular
G71 1620 12    European press, it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied.
G71 1630  7    Despite Berger's report, Enver Pasha refuses to surrender
G71 1640  7    his dream of a Turkish Blood Alliance; and Vincent
G71 1650  4    Berger learns that political ambition is more apt to
G71 1660  5    hide than to reveal the truth about men. But as he
G71 1660 16    discovers shortly, on returning among intellectuals
G71 1670  6    obsessed by le culte du moi, his experience of action
G71 1680  7    had also taught him a more positive lesson. "For six
G71 1690  4    years my father had had to do too much commanding and
G71 1700  2    convincing" writes the narrator, "not to understand
G71 1700  9    that man begins with 'the other'".
G71 1710  5       And when Vincent Berger returns to Europe, this
G71 1720  4    first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably
G71 1730  2    enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation. For
G71 1730 10    a dawning sense of illumination occurs in consequence
G71 1740  7    of two events which, as so often in Malraux, suddenly
G71 1750  7    confront a character with the existential question
G71 1760  2    of the nature and value of human life. One such event
G71 1770  1    is the landing in Europe itself, when the mingled familiarity
G71 1770 11    and strangeness of the Occident, after the blank immensities
G71 1780  8    of Asia, shocks the returning traveller into a realization
G71 1790  7    of the infinite possibilities of human life.
