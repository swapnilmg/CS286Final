G75 0010  1    There had been signs and portents like the regular
G75 0010 10    toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro di
G75 0020  8    Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo.
G75 0030  3       Something was happening all right, slowly it is
G75 0040  2    true, but you could feel it. The Italians felt it.
G75 0040 12    Little things. An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes
G75 0050  7    policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace,
G75 0060  6    the first time since the war. At least they hadn't
G75 0070  3    stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated, flat,
G75 0080  1    dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini's home district-
G75 0080  7    Dogumenti, per favore. But, who knew, that might be
G75 0090  9    coming one of these days. There were other Italians
G75 0100  5    who still bore scars they had earned in police station
G75 0110  4    basements, resisting. They laughed and, true to national
G75 0120  1    form and manners, never talked long or solemnly on
G75 0120 10    any subject at all, but some of them worried out loud
G75 0140  9    about short memories and ghosts.
G75 0150  1       We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while,
G75 0150 12    tall, lean, nervous and handsome, and, in our opinion,
G75 0170  8    the best novelist of them all except Pavese, and Pavese
G75 0180  6    is dead. Berto's The Sky Is Red had been a small masterpiece
G75 0190  7    and in its special way the best book to come out of
G75 0200  5    the war. Now he was married to a beautiful girl, had
G75 0210  1    a small son, and lived in an expensive apartment and
G75 0210 11    worked for the movies. On his desk was a slowly accumulating
G75 0220  9    treatment and script of The Count of Monte Cristo.
G75 0230  6    On his bookshelves were some of the latest American
G75 0240  4    novels, including Bellow's Seize the Day, but he hadn't
G75 0250  4    read them (they were sent by American publishers) and
G75 0260  1    wasn't especially interested in what the American writers
G75 0260  9    were up to. He was interested in Robert Musil's The
G75 0270  9    Man without Qualities. So were a lot of other people.
G75 0280  8    He was interested in Italo Svevo. He was thinking his
G75 0290  6    way into a new novel, a big one, one that people had
G75 0300  3    been waiting for. It was going to be hard going all
G75 0300 14    the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while,
G75 0310 10    except for a few stories, was tired of the old method
G75 0320  8    of realismo he had so successfully used in The Sky
G75 0330  5    Is Red. This one was going to be different. He had
G75 0340  3    bought a little piece of property down along the coast
G75 0350  1    of the hard country of Calabria that he knew so well.
G75 0350 12    He was going to do one or two more films for cash and
G75 0360 11    then chuck it all, leave Rome and its intellectual
G75 0370  4    cliques and money-fed life, go back to Calabria.
G75 0380  1       Berto seemed worried, too. He knew all about it
G75 0380 10    and had put it down in journal form in The War in a
G75 0390 11    Black Shirt, a wonderful book not, for some strange
G75 0400  6    reason, published in the U.S. He knew all about the
G75 0410  5    appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor, southern,
G75 0420  2    peasant boy. He knew all about the infection and the
G75 0420 12    fever, and, too, the moment of realization when he
G75 0430  9    saw for himself, threw up his hands and quit, ended
G75 0440  6    the war as a prisoner in Texas. Berto knew all about
G75 0450  3    Fascism. So did his friend, the young novelist Rimanelli.
G75 0460  1    Rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous,
G75 0460  9    says what he thinks. He had put it down in a war novel,
G75 0470 11    The Day of the Lion. These people were not talking
G75 0480  6    much about it, but you, a foreigner, sensed their apprehension
G75 0490  4    and disappointment.
G75 0490  6       So there we were talking around and about it. The
G75 0500  7    English lady said she had to go to Vienna for a while.
G75 0510  6    It was a pity because she had planned to lay a wreath
G75 0520  3    at the foot of the Garibaldi statue, towering over
G75 0520 12    Rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint
G75 0530  6    of the Gianicolo. Around that statue in the green park
G75 0540  7    where children play and lovers walk in twos and there
G75 0550  3    is a glowing view of the whole city, in that park are
G75 0550 15    the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men,
G75 0560  9    the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio
G75 0570  9    and, under fire all the way, up the long, straight
G75 0580  5    narrow lane to take, then lose the high ground of the
G75 0590  3    Villa Doria Pamphili. When they lost it, the French
G75 0590 12    artillery moved in, and that was the end for Garibaldi
G75 0600 10    that time, on 30 April 1849. Once out of the gate they
G75 0610  9    had charged straight up the narrow lane. We had walked
G75 0620  5    it many times and shivered, figuring what a fish barrel
G75 0630  3    it had been for the French. Now the park is filled
G75 0630 14    with marble busts and all the streets in the immediate
G75 0640 10    area have the full and proper names of the men who
G75 0650  7    fell.
G75 0650  8       We were at a party once and heard an idealistic
G75 0660  4    young European call that awful charge glorious. Our
G75 0670  2    companion was a huge, plain-spoken American sculptor
G75 0670 10    who had been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across
G75 0680  9    France in 1944. He said it was stupid butchery to order
G75 0690  7    men to make a charge like that, no matter who gave
G75 0700  4    the order and what for.
G75 0700  9       "Oh, it would be butchery all right", the European
G75 0720  3    said. "We would see it that way, but it was glorious
G75 0730  4    then. It was the last time in history anybody could
G75 0740  1    do something gloriously like that".
G75 0740  6       I thought: Who is older now? Old world and new world.
G75 0750  8       The sculptor looked at him, bugeyed and amazed,
G75 0760  5    angry. He had made an assault once with 180 men. It
G75 0770  3    was a picked assault company. They went up against
G75 0770 12    an SS unit of comparable size, over a little rise
G75 0780  9    of ground, over an open field. Object- a village crossroads.
G75 0790  6    They made it, killed every last one of the Krauts,
G75 0800  5    took the village on schedule. When it was over, eight
G75 0810  2    of his company were still alive and all eight were
G75 0810 12    wounded. The whole thing, from the moment when they
G75 0820  8    jumped heavily off the trucks, spread out and moved
G75 0830  5    into position just behind the cover of that slight
G75 0840  1    rise of ground and then jumped off, took maybe between
G75 0840 11    twenty and thirty minutes. The sculptor looked at him,
G75 0850  8    let the color drain out of his face, grinned, and looked
G75 0860  7    down into his drink, a bad Martini made with raw Italian
G75 0870  5    gin.
G75 0870  6       "Bullshit", he said softly.
G75 0880  1       "Excuse me", the European said. "I am not familiar
G75 0880 10    with the expression".
G75 0890  3       The apartment where we were talking that afternoon
G75 0900  1    in March faced onto the street Garibaldi's men had
G75 0900 10    charged up and along. Across the way from the apartment
G75 0910 10    building is a ruined house, shot to hell that day in
G75 0920  8    1849, and left that way as a memorial. There is a bronze
G75 0930  5    wreath on the wall. Like everything else in Rome, ruins
G75 0940  2    and monuments alike, that house is lived in. I have
G75 0940 12    seen diapers strung across the ruined roof.
G75 0950  6       The English lady really wanted to put a wreath on
G75 0960  7    the Garibaldi monument on the 30th of April. She had
G75 0970  3    her reasons for this. For one thing, there wasn't going
G75 0980  1    to be any ceremony at all this year. There were a few
G75 0980 13    reasons for that, too: Garibaldi had been taken up
G75 0990  7    and exploited by the Communists nowadays. Therefore
G75 1000  3    the government wanted no part of him. (It is sort of
G75 1010  3    as if our government should decide to disown Washington
G75 1010 12    or Lincoln for the same reason.) And then there were
G75 1020  9    ecclesiastical matters, the matter of Garibaldi's
G75 1030  5    anti-clericalism.
G75 1030  7    There was a new Pope and the Vatican was making itself
G75 1040  7    heard and felt these days. As it happens the English
G75 1050  5    lady is a good Catholic herself, but of more liberal
G75 1060  2    political persuasion. Nothing was going to be done
G75 1060 10    this year to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful
G75 1080  7    defense of Rome. All that the English lady wanted to
G75 1090  7    do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath
G75 1100  5    at its base. This would show that somebody, even a
G75 1100 15    foreigner living in Rome, cared. And then there were
G75 1110  9    other things. Some of the marble busts in the park
G75 1120  8    are of young Englishmen who fought and died for Garibaldi.
G75 1130  5    She also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers
G75 1140  3    at the bust of Lauro di Bosis.
G75 1140 10       It is hard for me to know how I feel about Lauro
G75 1150  8    di Bosis. I suffer from mixed feelings. He was a well-to-do,
G75 1160  7    handsome, and sensitive young poet. His bust shows
G75 1170  2    an intense, mustached, fine-featured face. He flew
G75 1170 10    over Rome one day during the early days of Mussolini
G75 1180  9    and scattered leaflets over the city, denouncing the
G75 1190  5    Fascists. He was never heard of again. He is thought
G75 1200  4    either to have been killed by the Fascists as soon
G75 1200 14    as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out
G75 1210 11    to sea and crashing his plane. He was, thus, an early
G75 1220  8    and spectacular victim. And there is something so wonderfully
G75 1230  5    romantic about it all. He really didn't know how to
G75 1240  4    fly. He had crashed on take off once before. Gossip
G75 1240 14    had it (for gossip is the soul of Rome) that a famous
G75 1250 12    American dancer of the time had paid for both the planes.
G75 1260 10    It was absurd and dramatic. It is remembered and has
G75 1270  6    been commemorated by a bust in a park and a square
G75 1280  2    in the city which was renamed Piazzo Lauro di Bosis
G75 1280 12    after the war. Most Romans, even some postmen, know
G75 1290  8    it by the old name.
G75 1300  1       Faced with a gesture like Di Bosis', I find usually
G75 1300 11    that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor
G75 1310  9    friend. The things that happened in police station
G75 1320  5    basements were dirty, grubby, and most often anonymous.
G75 1330  2    No poetry, no airplanes, no dancers. That is how the
G75 1330 12    real routine of resistance goes on, and its strength
G75 1340  9    is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant
G75 1350  6    people who can let themselves be taken to pieces, piece
G75 1360  5    by piece, without quitting. It is an ugly business
G75 1370  1    and there are few, if any, wreaths for them. I keep
G75 1370 12    thinking of a young woman I knew during the Occupation
G75 1380 10    in Austria. She was from Prague. She had been picked
G75 1390  7    up by the Russians, questioned in connection with some
G75 1400  4    pamphlets, sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage.
G75 1410  1    She escaped, crawled through the usual mine fields,
G75 1410  9    under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a river, and we
G75 1420 10    finally picked her up in Linz. She showed us what had
G75 1430  6    happened to her. No airplanes, no Nathan Hale statements.
G75 1440  3    Just no spot, not even a dimesize spot, on her whole
G75 1450  1    body that wasn't bruised, bruise on top of bruise,
G75 1450 10    from beatings. I understand very well about Lauro di
G75 1460  8    Bosis and how his action is symbolic. The trouble is
G75 1470  6    that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic
G75 1480  4    one.
G75 1480  5       The English lady wanted to pay tribute to Garibaldi
G75 1490  3    and to Lauro di Bosis, but she wasn't going to be here
G75 1500  1    to do it. Were any of us interested enough in the idea
G75 1500 13    to do it for her, by proxy so to speak? There was a
G75 1510 10    pretty thorough silence at that point. My spoon stirring
G75 1520  6    coffee, banging against the side of the cup, sounded
G75 1530  3    as loud as a bell. I thought: What the hell? Why not?
G75 1540  2    I said I would do it for her.
G75 1540 10       I had some reasons, too. I admire the English lady.
G75 1550  6    I hate embarrassing silences and have been known to
G75 1560  4    make a fool out of myself just to prevent one. I also
G75 1570  1    had and have feelings about Garibaldi. Like every Southerner
G75 1570 10    I can't escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats,
G75 1580  8    forlorn lost causes. Though Garibaldi's fight was small
G75 1590  6    shakes compared to Pickett's Charge- which, like all
G75 1600  4    Southerners, I view in almost Miltonic terms, fallen
G75 1610  3    angels, etc.- I associated the two. And to top it all
G75 1620  3    I am often sentimental on purpose, trying to prove
G75 1620 12    to myself that I am not afraid of sentiment. So much
G75 1630 10    for all that.
G75 1640  1       The English lady was pleased and enthusiastic. She
G75 1640  9    gave me the names of some people who would surely help
G75 1650  8    pay for the flowers and might even march up to the
G75 1660  5    monument with me. The idea of the march pleased her.
G75 1670  1    Maybe twenty, thirty, fifty. ... Maybe I could call
G75 1670 10    Rimanelli at the magazine Rottosei where he worked.
