A16 0190  4    #'BACK WITH THE MET'#
A16 0190  8    "We are back with the 'Met' again now that the 'Met'
A16 0200  8    is back in Chicago", bulletins Mrs. Frank S. Sims,
A16 0210  6    president of the women's board of the University of
A16 0220  5    Chicago Cancer Research Foundation. The New York Metropolitan
A16 0230  3    Opera Company will be here in May, and the board will
A16 0240  2    sponsor the Saturday night, May 13, performance of
A16 0240 10    "Turandot" as a benefit. Birgit Nilsson will be starred.
A16 0250  9       "Housed in the new McCormick Place theater, this
A16 0260  8    should prove to be an exciting evening", adds Mrs.
A16 0270  5    Sims. The board's last money raising event was a performance
A16 0280  5    by Harry Belafonte- "quite off-beat for this group",
A16 0290  4    decided some of the members. Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of
A16 0300  3    Winnetka, a new board member, will be chairman of publicity
A16 0310  1    for the benefit. Her husband recently was appointed
A16 0310  9    vice president of the university, bringing them back
A16 0320  7    here from the east.
A16 0320 11    #PARICHY-HAMM#
A16 0330  1    Because of the recent death of the bride's father,
A16 0330 10    Frederick B. Hamm, the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm
A16 0340  9    to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow
A16 0350  9    in St. Bernadine's church, Forest Park. A small reception
A16 0360  6    will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel.
A16 0370  2       Mrs. Hamm will not come from Vero Beach, Fla., for
A16 0380  2    the wedding. However, Mr. Parichy and his bride will
A16 0380 11    go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip, and will stay
A16 0390 11    in the John G. Beadles' beach house. The Beadles formerly
A16 0400  7    lived in Lake Forest.
A16 0410  1       Harvey B. Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece
A16 0410 10    in marriage. Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and the bride's other
A16 0420 10    uncles and aunts, the Rush C. Butlers, the Homer E.
A16 0430 10    Robertsons, and the David Q. Porters, will give the
A16 0440  8    bridal dinner tonight in the Stevenses' home.
A16 0450  3    #HERE AND THERE#
A16 0450  6    The Chicago Press club will fete George E. Barnes,
A16 0460  5    president of the United States Lawn Tennis association,
A16 0470  3    at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning at
A16 0480  2    5:30 p. m. tomorrow. Later, a bus will carry members
A16 0480 12    to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional
A16 0490  8    tennis matches at 8 p. m.
A16 0510  1       WITH loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the
A16 0510 10    Presbyterian-St. Luke's Fashion show still ringing
A16 0520  6    in her ears, its director, Helen Tieken Geraghty [Mrs.
A16 0530  5    Maurice P. Geraghty] is taking off tomorrow on a 56
A16 0540  8    day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim
A16 0550  3    as director of entertainment for next summer's International
A16 0560  1    Trade fair. Armed with letters from embassies to ministers
A16 0570  1    of countries, especially those in the near and far
A16 0570 10    east, Mrs. Geraghty "will beat the bushes for oriental
A16 0580  8    talent".
A16 0580  9       "We [the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry]
A16 0590  8    expect to establish closer relations with nations and
A16 0600  6    their cultural activities, and it will be easy as a
A16 0610  8    member of the fair staff to bring in acts", explains
A16 0620  2    Mrs. Geraghty. "For instance, Djakarta, Indonesia,
A16 0630  1    has three groups of dancers interested in coming here.
A16 0630 10    I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes
A16 0640  8    of Damascus"!
A16 0640 10       The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling
A16 0650  8    trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria
A16 0660  7    called upon her to explain that his brother would meet
A16 0670  5    her at the border of that country- so newly separated
A16 0680  2    from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't
A16 0690  1    been able to obtain a visa.
A16 0690  7    #FIRST, HONOLULU#
A16 0690  9    Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop. Then Japan,
A16 0700  7    Hong Kong, Manila, India, Pakistan, Damascus, Beirut,
A16 0710  5    and to Rome, London, and Paris "to look over wonderful
A16 0720  5    talent".
A16 0720  6       Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return;
A16 0730  5    the Geraghtys' youngest daughter, Molly, bows in the
A16 0740  5    Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night. Molly
A16 0750  3    already has her cotillion gown, and it's fitted, says
A16 0760  1    her mother. Also, invitations have been addressed to
A16 0760  9    Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts
A16 0770 10    club.
A16 0770 11       It won't be a "tea", however, but more of an international
A16 0780 10    folk song festival, with singers from Chicago's foreign
A16 0790  6    groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world.
A16 0800  6    The international theme will be continued with the
A16 0810  3    Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys
A16 0810 12    will give in the Racquet club after the tea. Miss Abra
A16 0820 11    Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind
A16 0830  9    up the day.
A16 0830 12    #BURKE-ROSTAGNO#
A16 0840  1    The Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting
A16 0850  1    for the wedding reception for their daughter, Helen
A16 0850  9    Lambert, and the young Italian she met last year while
A16 0860  8    studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith
A16 0870  6    college. He is Aldo Rostagno, son of the Guglielmo
A16 0880  2    Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year
A16 0880 11    in Europe. The Burkes, who now live in Kankakee, are
A16 0890 10    telling friends of the engagement.
A16 0900  4       Miss Burke, a graduate of Miss Hall's school, stayed
A16 0910  3    on in Florence as a career girl. Her fiance, who is
A16 0910 14    with a publishing firm, translates many books from
A16 0920  8    English into Italian. He will be coming here on business
A16 0930  8    in December, when the wedding is to take place in Wayne.
A16 0940  7    Miss Burke will arrive in December also.
