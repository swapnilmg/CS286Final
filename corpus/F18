F18 0010  1    The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor.
F18 0010 11    Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole
F18 0020  9    of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate
F18 0030  7    men who wore the blue and the gray. Some of their figures
F18 0040  4    of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate
F18 0050  1    observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise
F18 0050  9    on a hen and a dam site ornraier". Another reported
F18 0060  8    that his comrades were "in fine spirits pitching around
F18 0070  6    like a blind dog in a meat house". A third wrote that
F18 0080  5    it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".
F18 0090  1       Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression.
F18 0090  8    One wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off
F18 0100 12    his horse + snap at the stirups". A second reported
F18 0110  8    that the dilapidated houses in Virginia "look like
F18 0120  5    the latter end of original sin and hard times". A third
F18 0130  3    remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved about
F18 0140  2    from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry
F18 0140 13    leaches on the neck of a wooden god". Still another,
F18 0150 10    annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive,
F18 0160  6    wrote: "Yore letter was short and sweet, jist like
F18 0170  4    a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following
F18 0180  1    description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of
F18 0180 10    your one-horse girls. She is a regular stub and twister,
F18 0190  9    double geered. ... She is well-educated and refined,
F18 0200  7    all wildcat and fur, and Union from the muzzle to the
F18 0210  5    crupper".
F18 0210  6       Humor found many modes of expression. A Texan wrote
F18 0220  4    to a male companion at home: "What has become of Halda
F18 0230  3    and Laura? ... When you see them again give them my
F18 0240  1    love- not best respects now, but love by God". William
F18 0240 10    R. Stillwell, an admirable Georgian whose delightful
F18 0250  6    correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department
F18 0260  5    of Archives and History, liked to tease his wife in
F18 0280  5    his letters. After he had been away from home about
F18 0290  1    a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and
F18 0290 13    receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit
F18 0300 10    that I was married I don't feel much like a maryed
F18 0310  8    man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other
F18 0320  6    lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so
F18 0340  2    forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence,
F18 0340 10    wrote: "I am growing so fat ... I am a burden 2 myself".
F18 0350 13    Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer:
F18 0360  7    "Now I lay me down to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my
F18 0370  8    body creep; If they should bite before I wake, I pray
F18 0380  6    the Lord their jaws to break"".
F18 0385  1       Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed
F18 0390  7    from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was
F18 0400  9    the owner of a large plantation, well-educated, and
F18 0410  4    nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like
F18 0420  1    his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near
F18 0420 10    the end of his service he wrote that when the war was
F18 0430  9    over he was going to buy two pups, name one of them
F18 0440  5    "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and then shoot
F18 0450  3    them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and
F18 0460  1    'close-up'".
F18 0460  3       The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of
F18 0470  2    the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked
F18 0470 12    and wrote much about the elemental functions of the
F18 0480  9    body. One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea.
F18 0490  7    Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this
F18 0500  4    condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but a much
F18 0510  3    more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan
F18 0510 12    soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect
F18 0520  9    to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia
F18 0530 12    Shitts". Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued
F18 0540  8    with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front
F18 0550  5    often informed their families that they were suffering
F18 0560  1    from the "the Virginia quickstep".
F18 0560  6       A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description
F18 0570  7    of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea: "I have
F18 0580  5    bin a little sick with diorah two or three days ...
F18 0590  3    I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack
F18 0600  1    and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his
F18 0600 11    brother: "I am well at present with the exception I
F18 0610 10    have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find
F18 0620  8    you the same".
F18 0620 11       The letters which poured forth from camps were usually
F18 0630  8    written under adverse circumstances. Save for brief
F18 0640  4    periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers rarely
F18 0650  2    enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most
F18 0650 12    of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp,
F18 0660 10    on stumps, pieces of bark, drum heads, or the knee.
F18 0670  7    In the South, after the first year of the war, paper
F18 0680  4    and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many
F18 0690  1    Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing,
F18 0690  9    i.e., after writing from left to right of the page
F18 0700  8    in the usual manner, they gave the sheet a half turn
F18 0710  5    and wrote from end to end across the lines previously
F18 0720  1    written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets
F18 0720  8    were whizzing about their heads. A Yank writing from
F18 0730  8    Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, stated "Not less than 50 balls
F18 0740  7    have passed over me since I commenced writing ...
F18 0750  3    I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we take
F18 0760  2    no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg
F18 0760 12    informed his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge
F18 0770 11    pretty often ... for you can see that very plainly
F18 0780  9    by the blots in this letter. Just count each blot a
F18 0790  5    dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time".
F18 0800  2    Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before
F18 0800  9    Atlanta reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am
F18 0810  9    afraid they will knock over my ink, so I will close".
F18 0820 10    #III#
F18 0820 11    The most common type of letter was that of soldier
F18 0830  9    husbands to their wives. But fathers often addressed
F18 0840  4    communications to their small children; and these,
F18 0850  2    full of homely advice, are among the most human and
F18 0850 12    revealing of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves
F18 0860  9    occasionally would include in their letters admonitions
F18 0870  5    or greetings to members of the Negro community. Occasionally
F18 0880  3    they would write to the slaves. Early in the war it
F18 0890  3    was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp
F18 0890 13    Negro "body servants" to perform the menial chores
F18 0900  8    such as cooking, foraging, cleaning the quarters, shining
F18 0910  5    shoes, and laundering clothes. Sometimes these servants
F18 0920  4    wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of
F18 0930  2    their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and
F18 0930 10    to members of their owners' families.
F18 0940  5       Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with
F18 0950  3    sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages
F18 0960  1    characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters
F18 0960  8    usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth
F18 0970  6    of feeling.
F18 0970  8       Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly
F18 0980  7    to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits
F18 0990  4    in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or Nashville.
F18 1000  2    But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama
F18 1000 10    soldier whose feminine associations were of the more
F18 1020  7    admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements
F18 1030  4    among the Virginia belles: "They thout I was a saint.
F18 1040  5    I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all
F18 1050  2    ... I would tell them I got a letter from home stating
F18 1050 14    that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies
F18 1060 10    But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had
F18 1070 10    a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like
F18 1080  6    a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".
F18 1090  1       Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An
F18 1090  8    Ohio soldier who, from a comrade just returned from
F18 1100  7    leave, received an unfavorable comment on the conduct
F18 1110  4    of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself
F18 1120  1    thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy
F18 1120 12    was a runing together all the time and he though he
F18 1130 11    wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you
F18 1140  8    for he thought it was no more yuse ... I think you
F18 1150  4    made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler
F18 1150 16    as Alf dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed
F18 1160  9    card playing Sun of a bich com to Sea you, the god
F18 1170 10    damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion, he is
F18 1180  4    too orney for hel ... i will Shute him as shore as
F18 1190  1    i Sea him".
F18 1190  4       Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier
F18 1200  2    correspondents choice comments about their experiences
F18 1200  8    and reactions. A Federal infantryman wrote to his father
F18 1210  8    shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear
F18 1220  6    Pa ... Went out a Skouting yesterday. We got to one
F18 1230  6    house where there were five secessionist they brok
F18 1240  2    + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns
F18 1240 13    of biches and we all let go at them. Thay may say what
F18 1250 12    they please but godamit Pa it is fun".
F18 1260  5       Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in
F18 1270  2    their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers.
F18 1270 10    A Mississippi soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis
F18 1280  7    ... is a vain, stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian
F18 1290  7    wrote: "Col. Henry is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing
F18 1300  7    higher than the cultivation of corn". A Floridian stated
F18 1310  6    that his officers were "not fit to tote guts to a bear".
F18 1320  6    On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H. Fay, an unusual
F18 1330  4    Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard
F18 1340  3    University and who before the war was headmaster of
F18 1340 12    a private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife:
F18 1350 10    "I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke
F18 1360  8    I ever saw ... His head cannot contain enough sense
F18 1370  5    to command a regiment, much less a corps ... Jackson
F18 1380  3    ... runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to
F18 1380 13    follow their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he
F18 1390 10    is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born
F18 1400  7    to command".
F18 1400  9       Similar comments about officers are to be found
F18 1410  7    in the letters of Northern soldiers. A Massachusetts
F18 1420  3    soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War version
F18 1430  2    of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves
F18 1440  1    as made of a different material from the low fellows
F18 1440 11    in the ranks ... They get all the glory and most of
F18 1450 10    the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average,
F18 1460  6    the drunken rascals". Private George Gray Hunter of
F18 1470  4    Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My own
F18 1480  2    Mind that had it not been for officers this war would
F18 1480 13    have ended long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted
F18 1490  8    as to state: "I wish to God one half of our officers
F18 1500  9    were knocked in the head by slinging them against [the
F18 1510  4    other half]".
F18 1510  6       No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation
F18 1520  7    than the doctors. One Federal soldier wrote: "The docters
F18 1530  5    is no a conte ... hell will be filde with do[c]ters
F18 1540  3    and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after
F18 1550  1    the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing
F18 1550  9    Yank wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending
F18 1560  9    me to the hospital for treatment. I insisted on takeing
F18 1570  7    the field and prevailed- thinking that I had better
F18 1580  8    die by rebel bullets than [by] Union quackery".
F18 1590  2       The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward
F18 1600  1    each other were very much the same and ranged over
F18 1600 11    the same gamut of feeling, from friendliness to extreme
F18 1610  7    hatred. The Rebs were, to a Massachusetts corporal,
F18 1620  4    "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey + gunpowder
F18 1630  3    put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier wrote
F18 1640  2    that "they were the hardest looking set of men that
F18 1640 12    Ever i saw they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar
F18 1650 11    and shavings ...". Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the
F18 1660  7    Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary: "I strolled
F18 1670  6    among the Alabamans on the right ... found some of
F18 1680  5    the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe
F18 1690  1    their ignorance being little less than the slave they
F18 1690 10    despise with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned
F18 1700  8    as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all'".
F18 1710  8    In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side,
F18 1720  5    Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers,
F18 1730  2    in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that my
F18 1740  2    heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied
F18 1740 13    to have staid at home when my country is invaded by
F18 1750  9    a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto
F18 1760  5    is Booty ...
