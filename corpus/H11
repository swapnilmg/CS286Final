H11 0010  1    Another recent achievement was the successful development
H11 0010  8    of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter
H11 0020  9    of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively
H11 0030  6    non-volatile. This work gave a heat of formation of
H11 0040  4    aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value
H11 0050  1    which had been determined by a less direct method,
H11 0050 10    and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted
H11 0060  8    a few years ago. Similar measurements are being initiated
H11 0070  4    to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation
H11 0080  4    of another important combustion product, beryllium
H11 0080 10    fluoride.
H11 0090  1       The development and testing of new apparatus to
H11 0090  9    measure other properties is nearing completion. In
H11 0100  7    one of these, an exploding-wire device to study systems
H11 0110  5    thermodynamically up to 6,000 **f and 100 atmospheres
H11 0120  3    pressure, a major goal was achieved. The accuracy of
H11 0130  1    measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding
H11 0130  9    wire during a few microseconds was verified when two
H11 0140  8    independent types of comparison with the heat energy
H11 0150  5    produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent.
H11 0160  2    This agreement is considered very good for such short
H11 0160 11    time intervals. The method of calibration employs a
H11 0170  7    fixed resistance element as a calorimeter. The element
H11 0180  6    is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the
H11 0190  9    exploding wire, and the calorimetric heating of the
H11 0200  7    element is measured with high accuracy. This is used
H11 0210  4    as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and
H11 0220  1    the electrical energy obtained from the measured current
H11 0220  9    through the element and the measured voltage across
H11 0230  7    the element.
H11 0230  9       A high-speed shutter has been developed in order
H11 0240  7    to permit photographic observation of any portion of
H11 0250  5    the electrical wire explosion. The shutter consists
H11 0260  1    of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing
H11 0260 12    part. Using Edgerton's method, the fast-closing action
H11 0270  7    is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding
H11 0280  7    a series of parallel lead wires. The fast-opening of
H11 0290  5    the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil (approximately
H11 0300  2    **f) placed directly in front of the camera lens so
H11 0300 12    that no light may pass into the camera. The opening
H11 0310 10    action is obtained when a capacitor, charged to high
H11 0320  7    voltage, is suddenly discharged through the foil. During
H11 0330  4    the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage
H11 0340  2    of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward
H11 0340 13    toward its center line, thus allowing light to pass
H11 0350  9    into the camera. Experiments have shown that the shutter
H11 0360  6    is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds. The
H11 0370  2    shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing
H11 0380  1    the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input
H11 0380 10    to the foil.
H11 0390  1    _LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF INTERSTELLAR RADIO SPECTRA._
H11 0390  7       Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength,
H11 0400 10    the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain
H11 0410  6    sharp lines characteristic of other atoms, ions, and
H11 0420  6    small molecules. The detection and study of such line
H11 0430  4    spectra would add considerably to present information
H11 0430 11    on interstellar gas clouds and, perhaps, planetary
H11 0440  7    atmospheres. Among the most likely producers of detectable
H11 0450  6    radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides
H11 0460  3    OH and CH; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier
H11 0470  4    hydrides SH, SiH, and ScH. Very small concentrations
H11 0480  2    of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar
H11 0490  1    gas, concentrations as low as **f molecules/**f may
H11 0490  9    be sufficient, as compared to the **f hydrogen atoms
H11 0500  8    **f required for detection of the 21-cm line.
H11 0510  5       High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved
H11 0520  1    by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore,
H11 0520  9    only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies
H11 0530  7    is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of
H11 0540  7    these molecules feasible. To secure precise measurements
H11 0550  2    of these frequencies, a research program in free radical
H11 0560  1    microwave spectroscopy has been started. Since conventional
H11 0560  8    methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these
H11 0570  9    molecular transitions, the paramagnetic resonance method
H11 0580  5    is being used instead. This involves the application
H11 0590  4    of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor, which
H11 0600  2    shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently
H11 0600 10    high microwave range, where they may be measured with
H11 0610  8    optimum sensitivity.
H11 0620  1       The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic
H11 0620  9    resonance method was the OH radical. Results of this
H11 0630  9    experiment include the frequencies of the two strong
H11 0640  7    spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar
H11 0650  5    gas; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 **f, with
H11 0660  4    an uncertainty of 0.10 **f. Success in observing these
H11 0670  1    spectral lines has so far, apparently, been confined
H11 0670  9    to the laboratory; extraterrestrial observations have
H11 0680  4    yet to be reported. Preparations are being made for
H11 0690  5    similar experiments on CH and SH radicals.
H11 0700  2    _LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOMETRY._
H11 0700  5       The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide
H11 0710  6    a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services
H11 0720  2    in the range 1.5 to 20 **f. The efforts and accomplishments
H11 0730  1    fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry
H11 0730  8    based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas, secondary
H11 0740 10    thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior
H11 0750  6    of germanium resistors, and helium-4 vapor-pressure
H11 0760  3    measurements (see p. 144).
H11 0770  1    _ACOUSTICAL INTERFEROMETER._
H11 0770  1       An acoustical interferometer has been constructed
H11 0770  7    and used, with helium gas as the thermometric fluid,
H11 0780  9    to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 **f. Such
H11 0790  7    an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature
H11 0800  2    measurement, and may be used as an alternative to the
H11 0810  2    gas thermometer. When values of temperature derived
H11 0810  9    with this instrument were compared with the accepted
H11 0820  6    values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures,
H11 0830  5    differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively
H11 0840  1    were found. This result is preliminary, and work is
H11 0840 10    continuing.
H11 0850  1    _RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS._
H11 0850  3       Carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors
H11 0860  3    have been investigated for use as precision secondary
H11 0870  1    thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region.
H11 0870  8    Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled
H11 0880  7    from 300 to 4.2 **f and their resistances have been
H11 0890  5    found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when
H11 0900  2    temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer
H11 0910  1    whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid
H11 0910 10    helium. Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have
H11 0920  6    been made from 4.21 to 2.16 **f at every 0.1 **f. The
H11 0930  7    estimated standard deviations of the data for two of
H11 0940  3    the resistors were @ 1 millidegree; and for the third
H11 0940 13    resistor, @ 3.3 millidegrees.
H11 0950  4    _VAPOR PRESSURE METHOD._
H11 0950  7       The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers
H11 0960  6    have been investigated in conjunction with a "constant
H11 0970  6    temperature" liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 **f.
H11 0980  6    Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist
H11 0990  2    in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter
H11 0990 12    metallic storage dewars. The gradient was about one
H11 1000  7    half of a millidegree at 4.2 **f but increased to several
H11 1010  6    millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater
H11 1020  2    than the |l point. A hydrostatic head correction has
H11 1030  1    been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination
H11 1030  9    of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid
H11 1040  7    helium. However, the surface temperature gradient can
H11 1050  4    produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the
H11 1060  3    bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to
H11 1060 11    isolate the tube (which passes through the surface
H11 1070  8    to the vapor pressure bulb) from the liquid helium
H11 1080  5    surface. It has also been observed, in helium II,
H11 1090  2    that large discrepancies can exist between surface
H11 1090  9    vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor
H11 1100  8    pressure thermometer. This has been attributed to helium
H11 1110  6    film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer. In this
H11 1120  3    case also the design of the thermometer can be modified
H11 1130  1    to reduce the helium film flow.
H11 1140  1    _PRESSURE TRANSDUCER FOR PVT MEASUREMENTS._
H11 1140  2       Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements
H11 1140  7    on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet
H11 1150  9    rugged pressure transducer. A prototype which fulfills
H11 1160  5    the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested.
H11 1170  3    The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs
H11 1180  1    a stretched diaphragm, 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in
H11 1180 11    diameter. A small pressure unbalance displaces the
H11 1190  7    diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm
H11 1200  4    and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in.
H11 1210  3    apart (for **f). Spherical concave backing surfaces
H11 1220  1    support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are
H11 1220  8    applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm
H11 1230  6    from exceeding the elastic limit. Over a temperature
H11 1240  4    range from 25 to 200 **f and at pressures up to 250
H11 1250  2    atm, an overload of 300 psi, applied for a period
H11 1250 12    of one day, results in an uncertainty in the pressure
H11 1260  8    of, at most, one millimeter of mercury.
H11 1270  3    _TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF AIR._
H11 1270  7       A 6-year study of the transport properties of air
H11 1280  5    at elevated temperatures has been completed. This project
H11 1290  3    was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic
H11 1300  1    Missile Division of the Air Research and Development
H11 1300  9    Command, U.S. Air Force, and had as its goal the investigation
H11 1310 10    of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of
H11 1320  8    chemical binding. A significant effect discovered during
H11 1330  4    the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching
H11 1340  3    values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation
H11 1350  1    region. Another effect discovered is the large coefficient
H11 1350  9    of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from
H11 1360  7    the oxygen when temperature differences straddling
H11 1370  3    the nitrogen dissociation region are present. The results
H11 1380  3    of the study, based on collision integrals computed
H11 1380 11    from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular
H11 1390  8    forces in air, will be reported in the form of a table
H11 1400 10    of viscosity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusion,
H11 1410  3    and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000
H11 1420  3    to 10,000 **f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres
H11 1420 13    from **f to **f times normal density.
H11 1440  1    _INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES._
H11 1440  1       In March, 1961, representatives of the national
H11 1440  8    laboratories of Australia, Canada, The Netherlands,
H11 1450  6    United Kingdom, U.S.S.R., United States, and West Germany,
H11 1460  6    met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international
H11 1470  7    agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90
H11 1480  6    **f. As a first step toward this goal, arrangements
H11 1490  2    were worked out for comparing the scales now in use
H11 1490 12    through circulation of a group of standard platinum
H11 1500  8    resistance thermometers for calibration by each national
H11 1510  6    laboratory. Such a group of thermometers was obtained
H11 1520  3    and calibrated at the NBS. These thermometers have
H11 1530  2    now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration
H11 1530 11    at the National Physical Laboratory.
H11 1540  3    _TEMPERATURE SYMPOSIUM._
H11 1540  5       During the last week of march 1961, Columbus, Ohio
H11 1550  8    was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature,
H11 1560  4    Its Measurement and Control in Science and Industry.
H11 1570  3    The Symposium, which was jointly sponsored by the American
H11 1580  2    Institute of Physics, the Instrument Society of America,
H11 1590  1    and the National Bureau of Standards, attracted nearly
H11 1590  9    one thousand registrants, including many from abroad.
H11 1600  6    The Bureau contributed to the planning and success
H11 1610  6    of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack,
H11 1620  4    General Chairman, and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld, Program Chairman.
H11 1630  4    Dr. A. V. Astin, NBS Director, opened the 5-day session
H11 1640  7    with introductory remarks, following which a total
H11 1650  4    of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week
H11 1660  1    by NBS scientists, from both the Washington and Boulder
H11 1660 10    Laboratories.
H11 1670  1    #2.1.6. ATOMIC PHYSICS#
H11 1670  4    In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards,
H11 1680  4    spectroscopy, solid state physics, interactions of
H11 1690  2    the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary
H11 1690 11    to provide the foundation for technological progress,
H11 1700  7    the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory
H11 1710  5    astrophysics. The programs in infrared spectroscopy
H11 1720  3    are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards
H11 1730  1    in the far infrared, the application of infrared techniques
H11 1730 10    to solid state studies, and increased emphasis on high
H11 1740  9    resolution instrumentation. Two data centers have been
H11 1750  6    established for the collection, indexing, critical
H11 1760  3    evaluation, and dissemination of bibliographies and
H11 1770  1    critical values in the fields of transition probabilities
H11 1770  9    and collision cross sections.
H11 1780  3    _LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS._
H11 1790  1       _TRANSITION PROBABILITIES._
H11 1790  1       Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research
H11 1800  1    and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a data center
H11 1800 10    was established to gather and index all published information
H11 1810  8    on atomic transition probabilities. An exhaustive survey
H11 1820  5    was made of the literature, and a primary reference
H11 1830  5    file of approximately 600 references was catalogued.
H11 1840  1    Selected bibliographies and tables of available data
H11 1840  8    are now in preparation.
H11 1850  3       A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed
H11 1860  2    and used to study transition probabilities of atomic
H11 1860 10    hydrogen and oxygen. This apparatus will also be used
H11 1870  9    to measure transition probabilities of a large number
H11 1880  6    of other elements. A study of the hydrogen line profiles
H11 1900  3    indicates that a measurement of these profiles can
H11 1910  1    be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma
H11 1910 11    that is reliable to about **f percent.
H11 1920  5       A set of tables containing spectral intensities
H11 1930  1    for 39,000 lines of 70 elements, as observed in a copper
H11 1930 12    matrix in a d-c arc, was completed and published.
H11 1940 10    Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may
H11 1950  6    be converted to approximate transition probabilities.
H11 1960  2    These data are not of the precision obtainable by the
H11 1970  2    methods previously mentioned, but the vast number of
H11 1970 10    approximate values available will be useful in many
H11 1980  7    areas.
H11 1990  1    _ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS._
H11 1990  1       Research continues on the very complex spectra of
H11 1990  9    the rare earth elements. New computer and automation
H11 2000  6    techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable
H11 2010  4    success.
