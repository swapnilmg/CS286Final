G03 0010  1    Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident? What
G03 0010 10    steps have been taken to guard against the one sort
G03 0020  8    of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents?
G03 0030  4    Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster?
G03 0040  3    Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?
G03 0050  1    Will the danger increase or decrease?
G03 0050  7       I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon,
G03 0060  6    in the White House, in offices of key scientists across
G03 0070  4    the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for
G03 0080  2    months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes
G03 0080 11    which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately
G03 0090  7    known as "Sherwood Forest". I asked the same questions
G03 0100  7    inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile
G03 0110  6    base in Wyoming, where officers who wear sidearms are
G03 0120  3    manning the "commit buttons" that could start a war-
G03 0130  3    accidentally or by design- and in the command centers
G03 0130 12    where other pistol-packing men could give orders to
G03 0140  8    push such buttons.
G03 0140 11       To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits,
G03 0150  9    submarine compartments and the antiseptic, windowless
G03 0160  5    rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal
G03 0170  3    intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched.
G03 0180  1    There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate.
G03 0190  1    "Readiness exercises" are almost continuous. Each could
G03 0190  8    be the real thing.
G03 0200  2       In the command centers there are special clocks
G03 0200 10    ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since "E hour".
G03 0210 10    "E" stands for "execution"- the moment a "go order"
G03 0220  9    would unleash an American nuclear strike. There is
G03 0230  7    little time for the men in the command centers to reflect
G03 0240  5    about the implications of these clocks. They are preoccupied
G03 0250  4    riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing colored
G03 0260  2    lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like
G03 0260 12    business machines. They know little about their machinery
G03 0270  8    beyond mechanical details. Accidental war is so sensitive
G03 0280  7    a subject that most of the people who could become
G03 0290  4    directly involved in one are told just enough so they
G03 0300  2    can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.
G03 0310  1       Among the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists
G03 0310  7    and others charged with controlling the actions of
G03 0320  7    the button pushers and their "hardware", the answers
G03 0330  4    to my questions varied partly according to a man's
G03 0340  3    flair for what the professionals in this field call
G03 0340 12    "scenarios". As an Air Force psychiatrist put it: "You
G03 0350  9    can't have dry runs on this one". The experts are thus
G03 0360 10    forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have
G03 0370  6    never occurred, probably never will- but possibly might.
G03 0380  6    Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these
G03 0390  2    men: The more highly placed they are- that is, the
G03 0390 12    more they know- the more concerned they have become.
G03 0400  7       Already accidental war is a silent guest at the
G03 0410  8    discussions within the Kennedy Administration about
G03 0420  2    the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions
G03 0430  1    of national security. Only recently new "holes" were
G03 0440  1    discovered in our safety measures, and a search is
G03 0440 10    now on for more. Work is under way to see whether new
G03 0450  8    restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear
G03 0460  4    weapons.
G03 0460  5       Meanwhile, the experts speak of wars triggered by
G03 0470  4    "false pre-emption", "escalation", "unauthorized behavior"
G03 0480  2    and other terms that will be discussed in this report.
G03 0490  1    They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes"
G03 0490 10    and "gold phones". Their conversations were, almost
G03 0500  6    invariably, accompanied by the same gestures- arms
G03 0510  6    and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in
G03 0520  4    arclike semicircular motions. One arm represented our
G03 0520 11    bombers and missiles, the other arm "theirs". Yet implicit
G03 0530  9    in each movement was the death of millions, perhaps
G03 0540  8    hundreds of millions, perhaps you and me- and the experts.
G03 0550  7       These men are not callous. It is their job to think
G03 0560  7    about the unthinkable. Unanimously they believe that
G03 0570  2    the world would become a safer place if more of us-
G03 0570 13    and more Russians and Communist Chinese, too- thought
G03 0580  7    about accidental war.
G03 0590  2       The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's
G03 0590  9    box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago
G03 0600  9    by Fred Ikle, a frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist.
G03 0610  7    He was, and is, with the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit
G03 0620  5    pool of thinkers financed by the U. S. Air Force. His
G03 0630  6    investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental
G03 0640  3    war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.
G03 0660  1       In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense
G03 0660 11    policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration, basic
G03 0670  6    United States strategy has been modified- and large
G03 0680  6    new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war danger
G03 0690  2    and to reduce it as quickly as possible.
G03 0700  1       The chain starts at BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early
G03 0700  8    Warning System) in Thule, Greenland. Its radar screens
G03 0710  8    would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are
G03 0720  6    launched against the United States. BMEWS intelligence
G03 0730  3    is simultaneously flashed to NORAD (North American
G03 0740  3    Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, Colorado,
G03 0750  2    for interpretation; to the SAC command and control
G03 0760  1    post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air
G03 0760 11    Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War
G03 0770  7    Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and
G03 0780  7    to the President.
G03 0780 10       Telephones, Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems
G03 0790  7    and, in some cases, television, link all vital points.
G03 0800  5    Alternate locations exist for all key command centers.
G03 0810  2    For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command
G03 0820  1    posts on KC-135 jet tankers. Multiple circuits, routings
G03 0820 10    and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.
G03 0830  9       The same principle of "redundancy" applies to all
G03 0840  8    communications on these special networks. And no messages
G03 0850  6    can be transmitted on these circuits until senders
G03 0860  3    and receivers authenticate in advance, by special codes,
G03 0880  1    that the messages actually come from their purported
G03 0880  9    sources. Additional codes can be used to challenge
G03 0890  7    and counterchallenge the authentications.
G03 0900  1       Only the President is permitted to authorize the
G03 0910  1    use of nuclear weapons. That's the law. But what if
G03 0910 11    somebody decides to break it? The President cannot
G03 0920  7    personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear
G03 0930  5    trigger. He makes the momentous decision. Hundreds
G03 0940  2    of men are required to pass the word to the button
G03 0940 13    pushers and to push the buttons. What if one or more
G03 0950 11    of them turn irrational or suddenly, coolly, decide
G03 0960  5    to clobber the Russians? What if the President himself,
G03 0970  2    in the language of the military, "goes ape"? Or singlehandedly
G03 0980  3    decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets
G03 0990  1    without provocation?
G03 0990  3       Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers.
G03 1000  3    However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully,
G03 1010  1    so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.
G03 1010 11       Even the President cannot pick up his telephone
G03 1020  8    and give a "go" order. Even he does not know the one
G03 1030  8    signal for a nuclear strike- the "go code". In an emergency
G03 1040  6    he would receive available intelligence on the "gold-phone
G03 1050  5    circuit". A system of "gold"- actually yellow- phones
G03 1060  2    connects him with the offices and action stations of
G03 1070  1    the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
G03 1070 10    the SAC commander and other key men. All can be connected
G03 1080 10    with the gold circuit from their homes. All could help
G03 1090  7    the President make his decision. The talk would not
G03 1100  5    be in code, but neither would it ramble. Vital questions
G03 1110  2    would be quickly answered according to a preprepared
G03 1110 10    agenda. Officers who participate in the continual practice
G03 1120  8    drills assured me that the President's decision could
G03 1130  7    be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes
G03 1140  5    after the first flash from BMEWS.
G03 1150  1       If communications work, his decision would be instantly
G03 1150  9    known in all command posts that would originate the
G03 1160  9    actual go order. For these centers, too, are on the
G03 1170  7    gold circuit. They include the Navy's Atlantic Command
G03 1180  3    at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with the
G03 1190  2    Polaris subs; NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force
G03 1200  1    forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific,
G03 1200  9    which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases;
G03 1210  8    and SAC, which controls long-range bombers and Atlas
G03 1220  6    missiles.
G03 1220  7       Let us look in on one of these nerve centers- SAC
G03 1230  7    at Omaha- and see what must still happen before a wing
G03 1250  6    of B-52 bombers could drop their H-bombs.
G03 1260  1       In a word, plenty. The key man almost certainly
G03 1260 10    would be Col. William W. Wisman, SAC's senior controller.
G03 1270  9    He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants,
G03 1280 10    all full colonels, mans the heart of the command post
G03 1290  8    twenty-four hours a day. It is a quiet but impressive
G03 1300  3    room- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one
G03 1310  1    feet high. Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps
G03 1310 10    and charts are crammed with intelligence information.
G03 1320  6    And Bill Wisman, forty-three, a farmer's son from Beallsville,
G03 1330  6    Ohio, is a quiet but impressive man. His eyes are steady
G03 1340  6    anchors of the deepest brown. His movements and speech
G03 1350  3    are precise, clear and quick. No question ruffles him
G03 1360  1    or causes him to hesitate.
G03 1360  6       Wisman, who has had the chief controller's job for
G03 1370  3    four years, calls the signals for a team operating
G03 1380  1    three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights,
G03 1380 10    switches and buttons. At least a dozen men, some armed,
G03 1390  8    are never far away from him. In front of him is a gold
G03 1400  8    phone. In emergencies the SAC commander, Gen. Thomas
G03 1410  3    Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy
G03 1420  1    a balcony that stretches across the length of the room
G03 1420 11    above Wisman and his staff. At General Power's seat
G03 1430  8    in the balcony there is also a gold phone. General
G03 1440  6    Power would participate in the decision making. Wisman,
G03 1450  3    below, would listen in and act. His consoles can give
G03 1460  1    him instant contact with more than seventy bases around
G03 1460 10    the world and with every SAC aircraft.
G03 1470  5       He need only pick up one of the two red telephone
G03 1480  5    receivers at his extreme left, right next to the big
G03 1490  2    red button marked ALERT. (There are two receivers in
G03 1490 11    case one should be dropped and damaged.)
G03 1500  7       But Wisman, too, does not know the go code. He must
G03 1510  7    take it from "the red box". In point of fact, this
G03 1520  4    is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and
G03 1520 16    a half feet square and hung from the wall about six
G03 1530 10    feet from the door to Wisman's right. The box is internally
G03 1540  7    wired so the door can never be opened without setting
G03 1550  5    off a screeching klaxon ("It's real obnoxious").
G03 1560  1       Now we must become vague, for we are approaching
G03 1570  1    one of the nation's most guarded secrets. The codes
G03 1570 10    in the red box- there are several of them covering
G03 1580  9    various contingencies- are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof
G03 1590  7    "unique device". They are supplied, a batch at a time,
G03 1600  6    by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman
G03 1610  3    or his staff, at random intervals.
G03 1610  9       But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start
G03 1620  6    a war. They are mere fragments, just one portion of
G03 1630  5    preprepared messages. What these fragments are and
G03 1640  2    how they activate the go order may not be revealed.
G03 1640 12    The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared
G03 1650  9    messages by Wisman's staff. In addition to the authentication
G03 1660  6    and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow
G03 1670  5    the sending of the go messages, again in special codes,
G03 1680  2    each message also contains an "internal authenticator",
G03 1690  1    another specific signal to convince the recipient that
G03 1690  9    he is getting the real thing.
G03 1700  4       I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out
G03 1710  2    the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. "I'd
G03 1710 12    wind up full of .38 bullet holes", he said, and there
G03 1720 11    was no question that he was talking about bullets fired
G03 1730  7    by his coworkers.
G03 1730 10       Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's, on alert near
G03 1740 11    their "positive control (or fail-safe) points", the
G03 1750  6    spots on the map, many miles from Soviet territory,
G03 1760  3    beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific
G03 1770  1    orders to proceed to their targets. They, too, have
G03 1770 10    fragments of the go code with them. As Wisman put it,
G03 1780 10    "They have separate pieces of the pie, and we have
G03 1790  7    the whole pie. Once we send out the whole pie, they
G03 1800  3    can put their pieces into it. Unless we send out the
G03 1800 14    whole pie, their pieces mean nothing". Why does Wisman's
G03 1810  9    ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in
G03 1820  8    possession of the button pushers? The answer is a cryptographic
G03 1830  6    secret. At any rate, three men out of a six-man B-52
G03 1840  9    crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message.
G03 1850  5    Each must match Wisman's "pie" with the fragment that
G03 1860  3    he carries with him. All three must compare notes and
G03 1860 13    agree to "go".
G03 1870  3    ##
G03 1870  4    After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated
G03 1880  1    work, including six separate and deliberate actions
G03 1880  8    by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate
G03 1890  8    stations in a bomber, each with another man beside
G03 1900  5    him to help, for an armed bomb to be released. Unless
G03 1910  2    all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and
G03 1910 11    seals from the handles removed first- no damage can
G03 1920  9    be done.
