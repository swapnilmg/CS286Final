G06 0010  1    Die Frist ist um, und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben
G06 0010 10    Jahr, the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman, as he
G06 0020  8    told of his career and wanderings, explaining that
G06 0030  5    the number seven had significantly recurred in his
G06 0040  3    life several times.
G06 0040  6       The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra,
G06 0050  3    William Steinberg, has molded his group into a prominent
G06 0060  4    musical organization, which is his life. When he added
G06 0070  2    to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the
G06 0070 10    London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958, he conducted
G06 0080  7    one hundred fifty concerts within nine months, "commuting"
G06 0090  5    between the two cities. This schedule became too strenuous,
G06 0100  5    even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg.
G06 0110  3    His London contract was rescinded, and now, he explains
G06 0120  2    cheerfully, as a bright smile lightens his intense,
G06 0120 10    mobile face, "I conduct only one hundred and twenty
G06 0130  8    concerts"!
G06 0140  1       Our meeting took place in May, 1961, during one
G06 0140  9    of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York, before he
G06 0150  6    left for Europe. As we began to converse in the lounge
G06 0160  4    of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and sensitivity
G06 0170  2    to light and sound became immediately apparent. Seeking
G06 0180  1    an obscure, dark, relatively quiet corner in the airy
G06 0180 10    room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine, he
G06 0190  6    asked if the soft background music could be turned
G06 0200  4    off. Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically
G06 0210  1    is piped into the public rooms, and which nolens volens
G06 0210 11    had to be endured. As he talked about himself, time
G06 0220  9    and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe, Steinberg
G06 0230  6    began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew
G06 0240  3    faint and was dispelled.
G06 0240  7       Did he come from a musical family? Yes: though not
G06 0250  5    professional musicians, they were a music-loving family.
G06 0260  4    In his native Cologne, where his mother taught him
G06 0270  2    to play the piano, he was able to read notes before
G06 0270 13    he learned the alphabet. She even devised a system
G06 0280  7    of colors, whereby the boy could easily distinguish
G06 0290  3    the different note values. When he started school at
G06 0300  2    the age of five-and-a-half, he could not understand
G06 0300 13    why the alphabet begins with the letter A, instead
G06 0310  7    of C, as in the scale. Because, like many other children,
G06 0320  5    he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes, he
G06 0330  3    composed his own studies. When he was eight he began
G06 0340  1    violin lessons. Soon he was playing in the Cologne
G06 0340 10    Municipal Orchestra, and during World War I, when
G06 0350  7    musicians were scarce, he joined the opera orchestra
G06 0360  5    as well. Steinberg claims that these early years of
G06 0370  3    orchestra participation were of invaluable help to
G06 0370 10    his career. "By observing the conductor", he says with
G06 0380  8    a twinkle in his eyes, "I learned how not to conduct".
G06 0390  8       The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen,
G06 0400  7    but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium.
G06 0410  4    Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies at the
G06 0420  3    conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint
G06 0420  9    and harmony, as well in the violin and piano. His professional
G06 0430 10    career began when he was twenty; he became Otto Klemperer's
G06 0440  8    personal assistant at the Cologne Opera, and a year
G06 0450  8    later was promoted to the position of regular conductor.
G06 0460  4       Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such
G06 0470  3    a responsible post? Yes, the Maestro assented.
G06 0480  1       Had he always wished to be a conductor? No, originally
G06 0480 10    he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even
G06 0490  9    performed as such. However, when he assumed the duties
G06 0500  6    of a conductor, he relinquished his career as a pianist.
G06 0510  4       Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera, after
G06 0520  2    which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky,
G06 0520 12    teacher of Arnold Scho^nberg and Erich Korngold. In
G06 0530  8    1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the
G06 0540  7    German Theater at Prague. During his tenure he also
G06 0550  6    fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera.
G06 0560  3    Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt
G06 0560 12    Opera, where he remained until he lost this position
G06 0570  9    in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime. During
G06 0580  7    these years the youthful conductor had contributed
G06 0590  3    greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany.
G06 0600  1    He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's
G06 0605  1    Manon Lescaut and de Falla's La Vida Breve. The Frankfurt
G06 0620  1    years were particularly noteworthy for his performance
G06 0620  8    of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under
G06 0630  8    Erich Kleiber, and the world premiere of Scho^nberg's
G06 0640  7    Von heute auf morgen. At the outset of his career,
G06 0650  7    Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement
G06 0660  2    of contemporary music by vowing to do a Scho^nberg
G06 0660 11    work every year. In Frankfurt, too, he directed the
G06 0670  9    Museum and Opera House concerts which, in addition
G06 0680  6    to the standard repertoire, featured novelties like
G06 0690  3    Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony.
G06 0700  2       Because of the political upheaval in Germany in
G06 0700 10    the 1930's, Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities
G06 0710  8    to the Jewish community. Through the Frankfurt Jewish
G06 0720  6    Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues,
G06 0730  7    with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann. As more and more Jewish
G06 0740  6    musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations
G06 0750  2    Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund
G06 0760  1    Orchestra, which also gave guest performances in other
G06 0760  9    German cities. In 1936 he accepted the leadership of
G06 0770  9    the Berlin Kulturbund. In the fall of that year the
G06 0780  8    best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund
G06 0790  4    orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw
G06 0800  3    Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra-
G06 0810  1    now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra- with
G06 0820  1    Steinberg as founder-conductor.
G06 0820  5       In 1938, at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini,
G06 0830  4    Steinberg left Germany for the United States, by way
G06 0840  3    of Switzerland. After he had spent the first three
G06 0840 12    years in New York as associate conductor, at Toscanini's
G06 0850  9    invitation, of the NBC Orchestra, he made numerous
G06 0860  7    guest appearances throughout the United States and
G06 0870  5    Latin America. In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo
G06 0880  4    Philharmonic. Seven years later he was asked to become
G06 0890  1    director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. Since 1944 he
G06 0890  9    has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera,
G06 0900  7    where he made his debut with a memorable performance
G06 0910  5    of Verdi's Falstaff. In recent years he has traveled
G06 0920  5    widely in Europe, conducting in Italy, France, Austria,
G06 0930  2    and Switzerland. He returned to Germany for the first
G06 0940  1    time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne,
G06 0940 11    Frankfurt, and Berlin.
G06 0950  3       Where in Europe was he going now?
G06 0950 10       First of all, to Italy for a short vacation- Forte
G06 0960 10    dei Marmi, a place he loves. Since it is not far from
G06 0970  9    Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's house, as he never
G06 0980  5    fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory of the
G06 0990  3    composer of La Boheme, which he considers one of Puccini's
G06 1000  1    masterpieces. Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm
G06 1000  8    about Italy: "Rome is my second home. I consider it
G06 1010 10    the center of the world and make it a point to be there
G06 1020 10    once a year". He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia
G06 1030  6    di Santa Cecilia, as well as concerts in Munich and
G06 1040  4    Cologne. "Then I return to the United States for engagements
G06 1050  3    at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia", he added.
G06 1060  2       The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises
G06 1060  9    to be of unusual interest. There will be premieres
G06 1070  9    of new works, made possible through Ford Foundation
G06 1080  4    commissions: Carlisle Floyd's Mystery, with Phyllis
G06 1090  3    Curtin as soprano soloist. Other world premieres will
G06 1100  2    be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba
G06 1110  2    Concertante.
G06 1110  3       "And next year we will do- also a Ford commission-
G06 1120  4    a piano concerto by Elliott Carter, with Jacob Lateiner
G06 1130  2    as soloist. Of course, I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner
G06 1140  1    works in the coming season, as usual. We'll play Bruckner's
G06 1150  1    Fifth Symphony in the original version, and Mahler's
G06 1150  9    Seventh- the least accessible, known, and played of
G06 1160 10    Mahler's works. My Pittsburghers have become real addicts
G06 1170  5    to Mahler and Bruckner".
G06 1180  1       He added that he also stresses the works of these
G06 1180 11    favorite masters on tour, especially Mahler's First
G06 1190  6    and Fourth symphonies, and Das Lied von der Erde, and
G06 1200  7    Bruckner's Sixth- which is rarely played- and Seventh.
G06 1210  3    Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as "my travel symphony".
G06 1220  3    He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked
G06 1230  3    him for "still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans",
G06 1240  1    the public's response at the next concert was a standing
G06 1240 11    ovation.
G06 1250  1       "Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement
G06 1250  9    and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer
G06 1260  9    with us, I am probably the only one- with the possible
G06 1270  7    exception of Leonard Bernstein- who has this special
G06 1280  7    affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and
G06 1290  2    Mahler".
G06 1290  3       Since he introduces so much modern music, I could
G06 1300  3    not resist asking how he felt about it.
G06 1300 11       "There was always and at all times a contemporary
G06 1310  8    music and it expresses the era in which it was created.
G06 1320  6    But I usually stick to the old phrase: 'Ich habe ein
G06 1330  4    Amt, aber keine Meinung (I hold an office, but I do
G06 1340  3    not feel entitled to have an opinion). I consider it
G06 1340 13    to be my job to expose the public to what is being
G06 1350 10    written today".
G06 1350 12       With all his musical activities, did he have the
G06 1360  9    time and inclination to do anything else? He had just
G06 1370  7    paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire
G06 1380  3    his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals.
G06 1390  1    He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude
G06 1390 10    Lorrain, but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin
G06 1400  8    exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago.
G06 1410  8       And how did he feel about modern art? Again Steinberg
G06 1420  4    was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not
G06 1430  3    exposed to it enough to hazard comments. "As my wife
G06 1430 13    puts it", he said, again with a twinkle in his eyes,
G06 1440 11    "all you know is your music. But after all, you never
G06 1450  8    learned anything else"!
G06 1460  1       What did he do for relaxation? Like his late colleague,
G06 1460 11    Mitropoulos, he reads mystery stories, in particular
G06 1470  7    Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He cited Heine and Stendhal
G06 1480  6    as favorites in literature.
G06 1490  1       But his prime interest, apart from music, he insisted
G06 1490 10    seriously, was his family- his wife, daughter and son.
G06 1500  8    At the moment he was excited about his son's having
G06 1510  5    received the Prix de Rome in archaeology and was looking
G06 1520  4    forward to being present this summer at the excavation
G06 1530  1    of an Etruscan tomb. "Both children are musical and
G06 1530 10    my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and
G06 1540  8    judgment". "IS the attitude of German youth comparable
G06 1550  8    to that of "the angry young men' of England"? was the
G06 1560  7    topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische
G06 1570  4    Rundfunk in Munich.
G06 1570  7       I was chairman, the only not youthful participant.
G06 1580  6    Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts,
G06 1590  4    I added to my opening statement a sentence in which
G06 1600  2    I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm
G06 1600 12    which is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might
G06 1610  9    be classified as uninterested and bored rather than
G06 1620  5    angry. I was far from convinced of the truth of my
G06 1630  4    statement, but could not think of anything that might
G06 1630 13    evoke responses more quickly.
G06 1640  4       "It is easy for you to talk"; countered a twenty
G06 1650  4    year old law student, "you travel around the world.
G06 1660  1    We would like to do that too".
G06 1660  8       "But you want a job guaranteed when you return",
G06 1670  4    I continued my attack. "You must have some security",
G06 1680  3    said a young clerk.
G06 1680  7       When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I
G06 1690  7    did not even have the money for the return fare, but
G06 1700  3    had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient
G06 1700 13    amount, the young people looked at me doubtingly. One
G06 1710  9    girl expressed what was obviously in their minds.
G06 1720  5       "Would you advise us to act the same way? You might
G06 1730  5    have failed. I think it is rather foolhardy to trust
G06 1740  2    to luck".
G06 1740  4       Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends
G06 1760  2    or even strangers for help and that to be stranded
G06 1760 12    in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not
G06 1770  7    contribute to international understanding.
G06 1780  2       The debate needed no additional controversy and
G06 1790  2    soon I could ask each individually what he expected
G06 1790 11    from life, what his hopes were and what his fears.
G06 1800  8       Though the four boys and two girls, the youngest
G06 1810  5    nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four, came
G06 1820  2    from varying backgrounds and had different professional
G06 1820  9    and personal interests, there was surprising agreement
G06 1830  6    among them. What they wished for most was security;
G06 1840  6    what they feared most was war or political instability
G06 1850  2    in their own country.
G06 1850  6       The ideal home, they agreed, would be a small private
G06 1860  7    house or a city apartment of four to five rooms, just
G06 1870  4    enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and
G06 1880  1    two children. No one wanted a larger family or no children,
G06 1880 12    and none hoped for a castle or said that living in
G06 1890 10    less settled circumstances would be satisfactory.
G06 1900  3       All expressed interest in world affairs but no one
G06 1910  4    offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.
