J29 0010  1    _CONTROL OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS_
J29 0010  5       It would have been desirable for the two communities
J29 0020  4    to have differed only in respect to the variable being
J29 0030  2    investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method.
J29 0030 10    The structured schools were in an industrial city,
J29 0040  8    with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential
J29 0050  6    areas, but with one rather sizable section of middle-class
J29 0060  5    homes. The unstructured schools were in a large suburban
J29 0070  4    community, predominantly middle- to upper-middle class,
J29 0080  1    but fringed by an industrial area. In order to equate
J29 0080 11    the samples on socioeconomic status, we chose schools
J29 0090  7    in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status
J29 0100  4    of the neighborhoods. School principals and guidance
J29 0110  1    workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and
J29 0110  9    the research team made independent observations of
J29 0120  6    houses and dwelling areas. An objective scale was developed
J29 0130  6    for rating school neighborhoods from these data. Equal
J29 0140  4    proportions of children in each city were drawn from
J29 0150  1    upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods.
J29 0150  8    _SUBJECTS_
J29 0150  9       Individual differences in maturation and the development
J29 0160  7    of readiness for learning to read indicate that not
J29 0170  7    until the third grade have most children had ample
J29 0180  4    opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school
J29 0190  1    achievement. Therefore, third-grade children were chosen
J29 0190  8    as subjects for this study.
J29 0200  4       For purposes of sample selection only (individual
J29 0210  1    tests were given later) we obtained group test scores
J29 0210 10    of reading achievement and intelligence from school
J29 0220  6    records of the entire third-grade population in each
J29 0230  4    school system. The subjects for this study were randomly
J29 0240  2    selected from stratified areas of the distribution,
J29 0240  9    one-third as underachievers, one-third medium, and
J29 0250  7    one-third over-achievers. Children whose reading scores
J29 0260  5    were at least one standard deviation below the regression
J29 0270  4    line of each total third-grade school population were
J29 0280  2    considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample
J29 0280 10    selection. Over-achievers were at least one standard
J29 0290  8    deviation above the regression line in their school
J29 0300  5    system. The final sample was not significantly different
J29 0310  2    from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement
J29 0320  1    or intelligence test scores. Twenty-four classrooms
J29 0320  8    in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases,
J29 0330  5    87 boys and 69 girls. Eight classrooms in three structured
J29 0340  4    schools furnished 72 cases, 36 boys and 36 girls. Administrative
J29 0350  3    restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in
J29 0360  2    the structured schools.
J29 0360  5       It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely
J29 0370  4    random with respect to the personality variables under
J29 0380  2    investigation.
J29 0380  3    _RATING SCALE OF COMPULSIVITY_
J29 0380  7       An interview schedule of open-ended questions and
J29 0390  7    a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared, and
J29 0400  4    one parent of each of the sample children was seen
J29 0410  1    in the home. The parent was asked to describe the child's
J29 0410 12    typical behavior in certain standard situations in
J29 0420  7    which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies
J29 0430  4    toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others,
J29 0440  3    irrational conformity to rules, orderliness, punctuality,
J29 0450  1    and need for certainty. The interviewers were instructed
J29 0450  9    not to suggest answers and, as much as possible, to
J29 0460  8    record the parents' actual words as they described
J29 0470  5    the child's behavior in home situations.
J29 0480  1       The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed
J29 0480  8    by first perusing the interview records, categorizing
J29 0490  5    all evidence related to compulsivity, then arranging
J29 0500  3    a distribution of such information apart from the case
J29 0510  2    records. Final ratings were made on the basis of a
J29 0510 12    point system which was developed after studying the
J29 0520  7    distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning
J29 0530  4    weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant
J29 0540  3    from the discovered norms. Children scoring high in
J29 0540 11    compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension
J29 0550  8    or emotionality in situations where there was lack
J29 0560  5    of organization or conformity to standards and expectations,
J29 0570  3    or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals.
J29 0580  1    The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively
J29 0580 10    unconcerned about such matters. For instance, the following
J29 0590  8    statement was rated low in compulsivity, "She's naturally
J29 0600  6    quite neat about things, but it doesn't bother her
J29 0610  6    at all if her room gets messy. But she cleans it up
J29 0620  4    very well when I remind her".
J29 0630  1    _MEASUREMENT OF ANXIETY_
J29 0630  1       Castaneda, et al. revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale
J29 0630  9    for use with children. The Taylor Scale was adapted
J29 0640  9    from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory,
J29 0650  4    with item selection based upon clinical definitions
J29 0660  3    of anxiety. There is much research evidence to validate
J29 0670  2    the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals
J29 0670 10    who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees.
J29 0680  9    Reliability and validation work with the Children's
J29 0690  5    Anxiety Scale by Castaneda, et al. demonstrated results
J29 0700  4    closely similar to the findings with the adult scale.
J29 0710  4    Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing
J29 0720  2    device, in this study it was individually administered
J29 0720 10    by psychologically trained workers who established
J29 0730  5    rapport and assisted the children in reading the items.
J29 0750  1    _RELATIONSHIP OF ANXIETY TO COMPULSIVITY_
J29 0750  1       The question may be raised whether or not we are
J29 0750 11    dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity.
J29 0760  8    The two ratings yield a correlation of +.04, which
J29 0770  5    is not significantly different from zero; therefore,
J29 0780  2    we have measured two different characteristics. In
J29 0780  9    theory, compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing
J29 0790  8    anxiety, and one might expect a negative association
J29 0800  4    except for the possibility that for many children the
J29 0810  3    obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to
J29 0810 10    quell the amount of anxiety they suffer. The issue
J29 0820  9    of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will
J29 0830  5    be taken up later.
J29 0840  1    _CRITERION MEASUREMENT_
J29 0840  1       In the primary grades, reading permeates almost
J29 0840  8    every aspect of school progress, and the children's
J29 0850  6    early experiences of success or failure in learning
J29 0860  4    to read often set a pattern of total achievement that
J29 0870  2    is relatively enduring throughout the following years.
J29 0870  9    In establishing criterion measurements, it was therefore
J29 0880  6    thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading
J29 0890  6    act itself. The predicted interaction effect should,
J29 0900  3    if potent, extend its influence over all academic achievement.
J29 0910  1       The Stanford Achievement Test, Form J, was administered
J29 0920  1    by classroom teachers, consisting of a battery of six
J29 0920 10    sub-tests: Paragraph Meaning, Word Meaning, Spelling,
J29 0930  6    Language, Arithmetic Computation, and Arithmetic Reasoning.
J29 0940  5    All of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic
J29 0950  5    Computation. Scores are stated in grade-equivalents
J29 0960  4    on a national norm. The battery median grade-equivalent
J29 0970  1    was used in data analysis in this study.
J29 0970  9       The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was
J29 0980  6    administered to each sample third-grade child by a
J29 0990  6    clinical worker. The relationship of intelligence test
J29 1000  2    scores to school achievement is a well-established
J29 1000 10    fact (in this case, **f); therefore, in the investigation
J29 1010  7    of the present hypothesis, it was necessary to control
J29 1020  6    this factor.
J29 1020  8       The criterion score used in the statistical analysis
J29 1030  6    is an index of over- or under-achievement. It is the
J29 1040  4    discrepancy between the actual attained achievement
J29 1050  1    test score and the score that would be predicted by
J29 1050 11    the I.Q. For example, on the basis of the regression
J29 1060  9    equation, a child with an I.Q. of 120 in this sample
J29 1070  8    would be expected to earn an achievement test score
J29 1080  3    of 4.8 (grade equivalent). If a child with an I.Q.
J29 1090  1    of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement, his discrepancy score
J29 1090 10    would be +.7, representing .7 of one year of over-achievement.
J29 1100 10    A child with an I.Q. of 98 would be expected to earn
J29 1110  9    an achievement test score of 3.5. If such a child scored
J29 1120  8    3.0, his discrepancy score would be -.5, representing
J29 1130  2    .5 of one year of under-achievement. In this manner,
J29 1140  1    the factors measured by the intelligence test were
J29 1140  9    controlled, allowing discovered differences in achievement
J29 1150  5    to be interpreted as resulting from other variables.
J29 1160  4    #RESULTS#
J29 1170  1    _TEST OF INTERACTION OF COMPULSIVITY AND TEACHING METHODS_
J29 1170  4       Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical
J29 1180  3    analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the
J29 1190  1    descriptive variable. Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement
J29 1190  9    scores of each sub-group graphically. First of all,
J29 1200  8    as we had surmised, the highly compulsive children
J29 1210  3    in the structured setting score significantly better
J29 1220  2    (**f) on achievement than do similar children in the
J29 1220 11    unstructured schools. It can be seen too that when
J29 1230  9    we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured
J29 1240  4    schools, the high compulsive children do better (**f).
J29 1250  3    No significant difference was found in achievement
J29 1250 10    between high and low compulsive children within the
J29 1260  8    unstructured school. The hypothesis of there being
J29 1270  5    an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method
J29 1280  2    was supported, in this case, at the .05 level.
J29 1280 11       While we had expected that compulsive children in
J29 1290  8    the unstructured school setting would have difficulty
J29 1300  5    when compared to those in the structured, we were surprised
J29 1310  4    to find that the achievement of the high compulsives
J29 1320  1    within the schools where the whole-word method is used
J29 1320 11    in beginning reading compares favorably with that of
J29 1330  7    the low compulsives. Indeed their achievement scores
J29 1340  4    were somewhat better on an absolute basis although
J29 1350  2    the difference was not significant. We speculate that
J29 1350 10    compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater
J29 1360  8    strain because of the lack of systemization in their
J29 1370  7    school setting, but that their need to organize (for
J29 1380  4    comfort) is so intense that they struggle to induce
J29 1390  1    the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of
J29 1390 12    direction from the environment.
J29 1400  2       It is interesting to note that medium compulsives
J29 1410  1    in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement
J29 1410  9    scores (although not significantly lower). Possibly
J29 1420  5    their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them
J29 1430  5    to build their own structure.
J29 1430 10       Our conjecture is, then, that regardless of the
J29 1440  7    manner in which school lessons are taught, the compulsive
J29 1450  5    child accentuates those elements of each lesson that
J29 1460  3    aid him in systematizing his work. When helped by a
J29 1460 13    high degree of structure in lesson presentation, then,
J29 1470  8    and only then, does such a child attain unusual success.
J29 1490  1    _TEST OF INTERACTION OF ANXIETY AND TEACHING METHODS_
J29 1490  4       The statistical analyses of achievement in relation
J29 1500  2    to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions
J29 1500 10    of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Figure
J29 1510 10    2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each
J29 1520  5    group. As predicted, the highly anxious children in
J29 1530  2    the unstructured schools score more poorly (**f) than
J29 1530 10    those in the structured schools. The interaction effect,
J29 1540  7    which is significant at the .01 level, can be seen
J29 1550  8    best in the contrast of mean scores. While high anxiety
J29 1560  3    children achieve significantly less well (**f) in the
J29 1570  1    unstructured school than do low anxiety children, they
J29 1570  9    appear to do at least as well as the average in the
J29 1580  9    structured classroom.
J29 1580 11       The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated
J29 1590  8    is the marked decrement in performance suffered by
J29 1600  5    the highly anxious children in unstructured schools.
J29 1610  2    According to the theory proposed, this is a consequence
J29 1620  1    of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists
J29 1620 10    unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort
J29 1630  9    of school environment. The fact that such threat is
J29 1640  6    potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought
J29 1650  2    to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure
J29 1650 13    or under-achievement these children exhibit. The child
J29 1660  6    with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released
J29 1670  6    energy toward achievement, but because his distress
J29 1680  3    severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and
J29 1690  1    memorization of complex symbols, the child may fail
J29 1690  9    in his initial attempts to master the problem. Failure
J29 1700  6    confirms the threat, and the intensity of anxiety is
J29 1710  4    increased as the required learning becomes more difficult,
J29 1720  2    so that by the time the child reaches the third grade
J29 1720 13    the decrement in performance is pronounced.
J29 1730  6       The individual with high anxiety in the structured
J29 1740  5    classroom may approach the learning task with the same
J29 1750  4    increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination.
J29 1750 11    But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple. As
J29 1760 11    shown earlier, the highly anxious individual may be
J29 1770  6    superior in his memorizing of simple elements. Success
J29 1780  3    reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination
J29 1790  2    are improved. By the time the child first attacks the
J29 1800  1    actual problem of reading, he is completely familiar
J29 1800  9    and at ease with all of the elements of words. Apparently
J29 1810  8    academic challenge in the structured setting creates
J29 1820  3    an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety
J29 1830  2    is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic
J29 1830 13    state without becoming confused or panicked.
J29 1840  6       Sarason et al. present evidence that the anxious
J29 1850  6    child will suffer in the test-like situation, and that
J29 1860  4    his performance will be impaired unless he receives
J29 1870  1    supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher.
J29 1870  8    Although the present study was not a direct replication
J29 1880  8    of their investigations, the results do not confirm
J29 1890  5    their conclusion. Observers, in the two school systems
J29 1900  2    studied here, judged the teachers in the structured
J29 1900 10    schools to be more impersonal and demanding, while
J29 1910  8    the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged
J29 1920  5    to be more supporting and accepting. Yet the highly
J29 1930  4    anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only
J29 1940  1    in the unstructured school, and performed as well or
J29 1940 10    better than average in the structured setting.
