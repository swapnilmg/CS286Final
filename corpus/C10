C10 0020  1    Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives
C10 0030 12    the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience.
C10 0040  7    "Ring of Bright Water" by Gavin Maxwell is just that-
C10 0050  6    a haunting, warmly personal chronicle of a man, an
C10 0060  5    otter, and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands.
C10 0070  1       "He has married me with ... a ring of bright water",
C10 0090  1    begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes
C10 0090 10    his title, and it is this mystic bond between the human
C10 0100 10    and natural world that the author conveys. The place
C10 0110  5    is Camusfearna, the site of a long-vanished sea-village
C10 0120  3    opposite the isle of Skye. It is a land of long fjords,
C10 0130  1    few people, a single-lane road miles away- and of wild
C10 0130 12    stags, Greylag geese, wild swans, dolphins and porpoises
C10 0140  7    playing in the waters. How Maxwell recounts his first
C10 0150  6    coming to Camusfearna, his furnishing the empty house
C10 0160  4    with beach-drift, the subtle changes in season over
C10 0170  1    ten years, is a moving experience. Just the evocations
C10 0170 10    of time and place, of passionate encounter between
C10 0180  6    man and a natural world which today seems almost lost,
C10 0190  4    would be enough.
C10 0190  7       But it isn't. There is Mijbil, an otter who travelled
C10 0200  7    with Maxwell- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species-
C10 0210  6    from the Tigris marshes to his London flat. It may
C10 0220  4    sound extravagant to say that there has never been
C10 0220 13    a more engaging animal in all literature. This is not
C10 0230  9    only a compliment to Mijbil, of whom there are a fine
C10 0240  8    series of photographs and drawings in the book, but
C10 0250  5    to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened
C10 0260  1    otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London, then
C10 0260 11    by train (where he lay curled in the wash basin playing
C10 0270 10    with the water tap) to Camusfearna, with affectionate
C10 0280  5    detail.
C10 0280  6       Mij, as his owner was soon to learn, had strange,
C10 0290  7    inexplicable habits. He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting
C10 0300  5    visitors with his needle-sharp teeth. He preferred
C10 0310  1    sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow. Systematically
C10 0310 11    he would open and ransack drawers. Given a small ball
C10 0320 10    or marbles, he would invent games and play by himself
C10 0330  7    for hours. With curiosity and elan, he explored every
C10 0340  4    inch of glen, beach and burn, once stranding himself
C10 0350  1    for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff
C10 0350 13    and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell,
C10 0360  9    who nearly lost his life in doing so.
C10 0370  4       A year and a day of this idyll is described for
C10 0370 15    the reader, one in which not only discovery of a new
C10 0380 11    world of personality is charted, but self-discovery
C10 0390  6    as well. In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been
C10 0400  4    no loneliness. "To be quite alone where there are no
C10 0410  3    other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as
C10 0410 12    though some pressure had suddenly been lifted, allowing
C10 0420  7    an intense awareness ... a sharpening of the senses".
C10 0430  6       Now, with the increasing interdependence between
C10 0440  2    himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need,
C10 0450  1    that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.
C10 0450  9    Two other people in time shared Mijbil's love: "...
C10 0460  7    it remained around us three that his orb revolved when
C10 0470  6    he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave
C10 0480  4    and water ...; we were his Trinity, and he behaved
C10 0490  1    towards us ... with a mixture of trust and abuse, passion
C10 0490 12    and irritation. In turn each of us in our own way depended,
C10 0500 11    as gods do, upon his worship".
C10 0520  1       Yet the idyll ended. The brief details of Mijbil's
C10 0530  1    death lend depth to the story, give it an edge of ironic
C10 0530 13    tragedy. Man, to whom Mij gave endless affection and
C10 0540  9    fealty, was responsible in the form of a road worker
C10 0550  8    with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol
C10 0560  2    of the savage in man. But then, through a strange coincidence,
C10 0570  1    Maxwell manages to acquire Idal, a female otter, and
C10 0570 10    the fascinating story starts once more.
C10 0580  5       One is not sure who emerges as the main personality
C10 0590  4    of this book- Mijbil, with his rollicking ways, or
C10 0600  2    Maxwell himself, poet, portrait painter, writer, journalist,
C10 0600  9    traveller and zoologist, sensitive but never sentimental
C10 0610  7    recorder of an unusual way of life, in a language at
C10 0620  9    once lyrical and forceful, vivid and unabashed. This
C10 0630  4    reviewer read the book when it was first brought out
C10 0640  2    in England with a sense of discovery and excitement.
C10 0640 11    Now Gavin Maxwell's ring of bright water has widened
C10 0650  8    to enchant the world.
C10 0660  1    _NEW YORK_
C10 0660  3       - The performances of the Comedie Francaise are
C10 0660 10    the most important recent events in the New York theater.
C10 0670 10       They serve to contradict a popular notion that the
C10 0680  9    Comedie merely repeats, as accurately as possible,
C10 0690  5    the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed
C10 0700  2    in the 17th century. On the contrary, the old plays
C10 0700 12    are continually being reinterpreted, and each new production
C10 0710  7    of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie.
C10 0720  8       Of course, the well-received revivals last longer
C10 0730  4    than the others, and that further reminds us that the
C10 0740  4    Comedie is not insensitive to criticism. The directors
C10 0740 12    of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in
C10 0750 10    as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway
C10 0760  6    producers who, in two instances this season, closed
C10 0770  3    their plays after one performance. But they are aware
C10 0780  1    of the world outside, they court public approval, they
C10 0780 10    delight in full houses, and they occasionally dare
C10 0790  6    to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic.
C10 0800  2       In France, novel approaches to the classic French
C10 0810  1    plays are frequently attempted. The government pays
C10 0810  8    a subsidy for revival of the classics, and this policy
C10 0820  9    attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's
C10 0830  4    characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting
C10 0840  2    results.
C10 0840  3       So far as I know, the Comedie has never put Moliere's
C10 0850  3    people in the costumes of the 20th century, but they
C10 0860  2    do reinterpret plays and characters. Last season, the
C10 0860 10    Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief,
C10 0870  7    and, in consequence, we can expect fairly soon to see
C10 0880  6    still newer productions of Racine's "Phedre" and Moliere's
C10 0890  3    "School for Wives".
C10 0890  6       The new "Phedre" was done in 17th century setting,
C10 0900  8    instead of ancient Greek; perhaps that is the Comedie's
C10 0910  6    equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into
C10 0920  4    our own time. The speaking of the lines seemed excessively
C10 0930  2    slow and stately, possibly in an effort to capture
C10 0930 11    the spirit of 17th century elegance. A few literary
C10 0940  9    men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the
C10 0950  8    poetry at the expense of the drama, but the response
C10 0960  3    was mainly hostile and quite violent.
C10 0960  9       The new "School for Wives" was interpreted according
C10 0970  6    to a principle that is becoming increasingly common
C10 0980  5    in the playing of classic comedy- the idea of turning
C10 0990  4    some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.
C10 1000  1       Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago,
C10 1000  9    Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns,
C10 1010  9    while Fernand Ledoux, often performing at the Comedie,
C10 1020  6    made them more gross than Moliere may have intended.
C10 1030  3       Apparently, Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these
C10 1040  2    dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in "The
C10 1040 11    School for Wives". I say "apparently" although I saw
C10 1050  9    Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly
C10 1060  8    before his death; by that time, he seemed to have dropped
C10 1070  8    the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy.
C10 1080  4       Arnolphe, it will be recalled, is a man of mature
C10 1090  3    years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful
C10 1090 13    wife-to-be. The part can lend itself to serious treatment;
C10 1100  9    one influential French critic remarked: "Pity for Arnolphe
C10 1110  7    comes with age".
C10 1120  1       Accordingly, at the Comedie last year, Jean Meyer
C10 1120  9    played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for
C10 1130  8    turning the comedy into a tragedy. But the stuff of
C10 1140  7    tragedy was not truly present and the play became only
C10 1150  4    comedy acted rather slowly.
C10 1150  8       Wisely, the Comedie has brought Moliere's "Tartuffe"
C10 1160  5    on its tour and has left "The School for Wives" at
C10 1170  6    home. Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts
C10 1190  3    his benefactor's wife. Jouvet played him as a sincere
C10 1200  1    zealot, and Ledoux, at the Comedie, made him a gross
C10 1200 11    buffoon, or so the historians tell us.
C10 1210  6       Louis Seigner, who formerly played the deluded benefactor
C10 1220  4    opposite Ledoux, is the Tartuffe of the present production,
C10 1230  2    which he himself directed. His Tartuffe observes the
C10 1240  1    golden mean. His red face, his coarse gestures, and
C10 1240 10    his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality. But his
C10 1250  6    heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely
C10 1260  5    perfunctory; of course, they do not reflect sincerity,
C10 1270  2    but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of
C10 1270 14    his pious impersonation.
C10 1280  3       Occasionally, Seigner draws some justly deserved
C10 1290  2    laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to
C10 1290 11    another. The whole role, by the way, is a considerable
C10 1300  9    transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his
C10 1310  7    other parts. His normal specialty is playing the good-natured
C10 1320  4    old man, frequently stupid or deluded but never mean
C10 1330  2    or sly. Here, he is, quite persuasively, the very embodiment
C10 1330 12    of meanness and slyness.
C10 1340  4       Seigner is the dean of the company, the oldest actor
C10 1350  3    in point of continuous service. In that function, he
C10 1350 12    helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie. We
C10 1360  9    are often told that the Comedie has, unfortunately,
C10 1370  5    life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre
C10 1380  4    and lazy, drawing their pay without much acting but
C10 1390  1    probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying
C10 1390 10    off the stage. Seigner, however, is a fine actor and
C10 1400  8    probably the busiest man in the company; among his
C10 1410  4    other parts are the leads in "The Bourgeois Gentleman"
C10 1420  2    and "The Imaginary Invalid".
C10 1420  6       In Moliere's farce, "The Tricks of Scapin", Robert
C10 1430  7    Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles. Here
C10 1440  7    some innovation is attempted.
C10 1450  1       To begin with, Scapin is a trickster in the old
C10 1450 10    tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy
C10 1460  6    of courtship for his master. Hirsch's Scapin is healthy,
C10 1470  4    cheerful, energetic, revelling in his physical agility
C10 1480  2    and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen
C10 1480 10    whom he serves.
C10 1490  2       Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities
C10 1500  1    he has observed in the city toughs of the real world.
C10 1500 12    And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness, a no-nonsense
C10 1510 10    quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's
C10 1520  8    servant.
C10 1530  1       DJANGO REINHARDT, the ill-fated gypsy, was a true
C10 1530 10    artist, one who demonstrated conclusively the power
C10 1540  7    of art to renew itself and flow into many channels.
C10 1550  5       There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business
C10 1560  3    today who doesn't owe something to Django. And Django
C10 1570  1    owed much to Louis Armstrong. He told once of how he
C10 1570 12    switched his style of playing to jazz after listening
C10 1580  8    to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea
C10 1590  6    Market in Paris. It was the first jazz he had heard.
C10 1600  3       Django, who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in
C10 1610  1    Belgium and who died in 1953 in France, was an extraordinary
C10 1610 12    man. Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned
C10 1620 10    off when he fell asleep with a cigarette. And this
C10 1630  6    was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful
C10 1640  2    jazz.
C10 1640  3       You can catch up with him- if you haven't already-
C10 1650  1    on RCA-Victor's album. "Djangology", made up of tracks
C10 1660  4    he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet
C10 1660 12    of the Hot Club of France. This is a choice item and
C10 1670 12    Grappely deserves mention too, of course. He is one
C10 1680  8    of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin.
C10 1690  6       They play: "Minor Swing", "Honeysuckle Rose", "Beyond
C10 1700  3    the Sea", "Bricktop", "Heavy Artillery", "Djangology",
C10 1710  3    "After You've Gone", "Where Are You, My Love"? "I Saw
C10 1720  7    Stars", "Lover Man", "Menilmontant" and "Swing 42".
C10 1730  5       All this is great proceedings- get the minutes.
C10 1740  4       Kid Ory, the trombonist chicken farmer, is also
C10 1750  4    one of the solid anchor points of jazz. He dates back
C10 1760  2    to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into
C10 1760 12    New Orleans. His horn has blown loud and clear across
C10 1770  9    the land for more years than he cares to remember.
C10 1780  6       Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album
C10 1790  4    which he made. He is starred against Alvin Alcorn,
C10 1800  1    trumpet; Phil Gomez, clarinet; Cedric Haywood, piano;
C10 1800  8    Julian Davidson, guitar; Wellman Braud, bass, and Minor
C10 1810  8    Hall, drums.
C10 1820  1       The set contains "High Society", "Do What Ory Say",
C10 1830  2    "Down Home Rag", "Careless Love", Jazz Me Blues", "Weary
C10 1840  2    Blues", "Original Dixieland One-Step", "Bourbon Street
C10 1850  2    Parade", "Panama", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie", "Oh Didn't
C10 1860  3    He Ramble", "Beale Street Blues", "Maryland, My Maryland",
C10 1870  3    "1919 Rag", "Eh, La Bas", "Mood Indigo", and "Bugle
C10 1880  4    Call Rag".
C10 1880  6       All this will serve to show off the Ory style in
C10 1890  8    fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect
C10 1900  5    elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late
C10 1910  1    to lay hands on the gems.
