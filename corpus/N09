N09 0010  1       Miraculously, she found exactly the right statement.
N09 0010  8    She began it deliberately, so that none of her words
N09 0020  9    would be lost on him.
N09 0030  1       "I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord.
N09 0030 10    I'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as
N09 0040 11    my leg, and that I don't amount to anything. But"-
N09 0050  6       "But it don't matter a-tall", Lord supplied fondly.
N09 0060  6    "To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams, an'
N09 0070  6    the sweetest flower that grows".
N09 0080  1       Beaming idiotically, he pooched out his lips and
N09 0080  8    attempted to kiss her. She yanked away from him furiously.
N09 0090  7       "You shut up! shu-tt up-pp! I've got something to
N09 0100  7    say to you, and by God you're going to listen. Do you
N09 0110  6    hear me? You're going to listen"!
N09 0120  1       Lord nodded agreeably. He said he wanted very much
N09 0120 10    to listen. He knew that anything a brainy little lady
N09 0130  9    like her had to say would be plumb important, as well
N09 0140  6    as pleasin' to the ear, and he didn't want to miss
N09 0150  4    a word of it. So would she mind speaking a little louder?
N09 0160  1       "I think you stink, Tom Lord! I think you're mean
N09 0170  1    and hateful and stupid, and- louder"? said Joyce.
N09 0180  1       "Uh-huh. So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the
N09 0180 10    car. Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble".
N09 0190 11       He opened the door and got out. He waited at the
N09 0200  9    car side for a moment, looking down at her expectantly.
N09 0210  4       "Well? Wasn't you goin' to say somethin'"? Then,
N09 0220  3    helpfully, as she merely stared at him in weary silence,
N09 0230  2    "Maybe you could write it down for me, huh? Print it
N09 0240  1    in real big letters, an' I can cipher it out later".
N09 0240 12       "Aah, go on", she said. "Just go the hell on".
N09 0250 10       He grinned, nodded, and walked around to the front
N09 0260  8    of the car. Lips pursed mournfully, he stared down
N09 0270  4    at its crazily sagging left side. Then he hunkered
N09 0280  1    down on the heels of his handmade boots, peered into
N09 0280 11    the orderly chaos of axle, shock absorber, and spring.
N09 0290  8       He went prone on his stomach, the better to pursue
N09 0300  7    his examination. After a time, he straightened again,
N09 0310  2    brushing the red Permian dust from his hands, slapping
N09 0320  1    it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored, twenty-five-dollar
N09 0330  1    shirt.
N09 0330  2       He wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace
N09 0330 12    officer in this country. Never, he'd once told Joyce,
N09 0340  9    had he encountered any man or situation that called
N09 0350  7    for a gun. And he really feels that way, she thought.
N09 0360  5    That's really all he's got, all he is. Just a big pile
N09 0370  5    of self-confidence in an almost teensy package. If
N09 0380  1    I could make myself feel the same way ...
N09 0380 10       She studied him hopefully, yearningly; against the
N09 0390  5    limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy
N09 0400  4    to confirm her analysis. Here in the God-forsaken place,
N09 0410  2    the westerly end of nowhere, Tom Lord looked almost
N09 0410 11    insignificant, almost contemptible.
N09 0420  3       He was handsome, with his coal-black hair and eyes,
N09 0430  4    his fine-chiseled features. But she'd known plenty
N09 0440  2    of handsomer guys, and, conceding his good looks, what
N09 0440 11    was there left? He wasn't a big man; rather on the
N09 0450 10    medium side. Neither was he very powerful of build.
N09 0460  7    He could move very quickly, she knew (although he seldom
N09 0470  4    found occasion to do so), but he was more wiry than
N09 0480  1    truly strong. And his relatively small hands and feet
N09 0480 10    gave him an almost delicate appearance.
N09 0490  4       Just nothing, she told herself. Just so darned sure
N09 0500  5    of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone.
N09 0510  2    But, by gosh, I want him and I'm going to have him!
N09 0520  1       He caught her eye, came back around the car with
N09 0520 11    the boot-wearer's teetering, half-mincing walk. Why
N09 0530  6    did these yokels still wear boots, anyway, when most
N09 0540  5    had scarcely sat a horse in years? He slid in at her
N09 0550  5    side, tucked a cigar into his mouth, and politely proffered
N09 0560  1    one to her.
N09 0560  4       "Oh, cut it out, Tom"! she snapped. "Can't you stop
N09 0570  3    that stupid clowning for even a minute"?
N09 0580  1       "This ain't your brand, maybe", Lord suggested.
N09 0580  7    "Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar"?
N09 0590  8       "I feel like getting back to town, that's what I
N09 0600  7    feel like! Now, are you going to take me or am I supposed
N09 0610  6    to walk"?
N09 0610  8       "Might get there faster walkin'", Lord drawled,
N09 0620  4    "seein' as how I got a busted front spring. On the
N09 0630  4    other hand, howsomever, maybe you wouldn't either.
N09 0640  1    I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk, and I
N09 0640 12    c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of
N09 0650 10    hours".
N09 0650 11       "How- with what? There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes".
N09 0670  1       "Now, ain't it the truth"? Lord laughed with secret
N09 0670  9    amusement. "Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes, so
N09 0680  8    I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me".
N09 0690  7       "Tom! For God's sake"!
N09 0700  1       "Looky". He pointed, cutting her off. "See that
N09 0710  2    wildcat"?
N09 0710  3       She saw it then, the distant derrick of the wildcat-
N09 0720  1    a test well in unexplored country. And even with her
N09 0720 11    limited knowledge of such things, she knew that the
N09 0730  9    car could be repaired there; sufficiently, at least,
N09 0740  5    to get them back into town. A wildcatter had to be
N09 0750  4    prepared for almost any emergency. He had to depend
N09 0750 13    on himself, since he was invariably miles and hours
N09 0760  9    away from others.
N09 0770  1       "Well, let's get going", she said impatiently. "I"-
N09 0780  3    She broke off, frowning. "What did you mean by that
N09 0780 13    rattlesnake gag? Getting the boss rattlesnake to help
N09 0790  8    you"?
N09 0790  9       "Why, I meant what I said", Lord declared. "What
N09 0800  9    else would I mean, anyways"?
N09 0810  2       She looked at him, lips compressed. Then, with a
N09 0820  2    shrug of pretended indifference, she took a compact
N09 0820 10    from her purse and went through the motions of fixing
N09 0830  8    her make-up. In his mood, it was the best way to handle
N09 0840  7    him; that is, to show no curiosity whatsoever. Otherwise,
N09 0850  2    she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked
N09 0860  1    until she lost control of herself, and thus lost still
N09 0860 11    another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord
N09 0870  8    Vs. Joyce Lakewood.
N09 0880  1       The car lurched along at a snail's crawl, the left-front
N09 0880 12    mudguard banging and scraping against the tire, occasionally
N09 0890  8    scraping against the road itself. Lord whistled tunelessly
N09 0900  7    as he fought the steering wheel. He seemed very pleased
N09 0910  6    with himself, as though some intricate scheme was working
N09 0920  4    out exactly as he had planned. Along with this self-satisfaction,
N09 0930  3    however, Joyce sensed a growing tension. It poured
N09 0940  1    out of him like an electric current, a feeling that
N09 0940 11    the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were
N09 0950  8    coiling for action, and that that action would be all
N09 0960  5    that he anticipated.
N09 0960  8       Joyce had seen him like this once before- more than
N09 0970  6    once, actually, but on one particularly memorable occasion.
N09 0980  3    That was the day that he had practically mopped up
N09 0990  2    the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride, field
N09 0990 12    boss for the Highlands Oil + Gas Company.
N09 1000  8       Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long
N09 1010  7    time, just waiting to catch him out of line. McBride
N09 1020  3    gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town
N09 1020 13    with a pistol on his hip. He had a legitimate reason
N09 1030 11    for wearing it. It was payday for Highlands, and he
N09 1040  7    was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields.
N09 1050  4    Moreover, as long as the weapon was carried openly,
N09 1060  1    the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of
N09 1060 10    it.
N09 1060 11       "So what's this all about"? he demanded, when Lord
N09 1070  9    confronted him. I'm not the only man in town with a
N09 1080 10    gun, or the only one without a permit".
N09 1090  3       It was the wrong thing to say. By failing to do
N09 1100  1    as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return
N09 1100 13    the gun to his car- he had played into Lord's hands.
N09 1110  9       The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest.
N09 1120  8    The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting
N09 1130  6    him.
N09 1130  7       So, "How about it"? he said. "Why single me out
N09 1140  6    on this permit deal"?
N09 1140 10       "Well, I'll tell you about that", Lord told him.
N09 1150  9    "We aim t' be see-lective, y'know? Don't like to bother
N09 1160  6    no one unless we have to, which I figger we do, in
N09 1170  8    your case. Figger we got to be plumb careful with any
N09 1180  3    of you Highlands big shots".
N09 1180  8       McBride reddened. He himself had heard that there
N09 1190  7    was gangster money in the company, but that had nothing
N09 1200  5    to do with him. He was an honest man doing a hard job,
N09 1210  2    and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.
N09 1220  1       "Look, Lord", he said hoarsely. "I know you've got
N09 1230  1    a grudge against me, and maybe I can't blame you. You
N09 1230 12    think that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em
N09 1240  7    do it. But you're all wrong, man! I'm no lawyer. I
N09 1250  6    just do what I'm told, and"-
N09 1260  1       "Uh-huh. An' that could mean trouble with a fella
N09 1260 11    that's workin' for crooks. So you get rid of that pistol
N09 1270 11    right now, Mis-ter McBride. You do that or take you
N09 1280  8    out a permit right now".
N09 1290  1       McBride couldn't do either, of course. Not immediately,
N09 1290  9    as the deputy demanded. Not without a face-saving respite
N09 1300  9    of at least a few minutes. To do so would make his
N09 1310  8    job well-nigh impossible. Oil-field workers were a
N09 1320  4    rough-tough lot. How could he exert authority over
N09 1330  1    them- make them toe the line, as he had to- if he knuckled
N09 1330 13    under to this small-town clown?
N09 1340  5       "I'll get around to it a little later", he mumbled
N09 1350  4    desperately. "Just as soon as I go to the bank, and"-
N09 1360  1       "Huh-uh. Now, Mis-ter McBride", said Lord, and he
N09 1370  4    laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's
N09 1370 13    arm.
N09 1380  1       It was strictly the deputy's game, but McBride had
N09 1380 10    gone too far to throw in. Now, he could only play the
N09 1390 12    last card in what was probably the world's coldest
N09 1400  5    deck.
N09 1400  6       He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past
N09 1410  7    him, inadvertently shoving him into a storefront.
N09 1420  2       It was practically the last move that McBride made
N09 1430  1    of his own volition.
N09 1430  5       Lord slugged him in the stomach, so hard that the
N09 1440  3    organ almost pressed against his spine. Then, as he
N09 1440 12    doubled, gasping, vomiting the breakfast he had so
N09 1450  8    lately eaten, Lord straightened him with an uppercut.
N09 1460  5    A rabbit punch redoubled him. And then there was a
N09 1470  4    numbing blow to the heart, and another gut-flattening
N09 1470 13    blow to the stomach ...
N09 1480  5       But he couldn't keep up with them. No more could
N09 1490  3    he defend himself against them. He seemed to be fighting
N09 1500  1    not one man but a dozen. And he could no longer think
N09 1500 13    of face-saving, of honor, but only of escape.
N09 1510  7       Why, he's going to kill me, he thought wildly. I
N09 1520  5    meant him no harm. I've given willful hurt to no man.
N09 1530  4    I was just doing my job, just following orders, and
N09 1530 14    for that he's going to kill me. Beat me to death in
N09 1540 12    front of a hundred people.
N09 1550  2       Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he
N09 1550 10    was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would
N09 1560 10    probably not suffer for it: the murder would go unpunished.
N09 1570  7    He, McBride, would be cited as in the wrong, and he,
N09 1580  7    Lord, would go scot-free, an officer who had only done
N09 1590  3    his duty, though perhaps too energetically.
N09 1590  9       McBride staggered into the street, flopped sprawling
N09 1600  7    in the stinging dust. Fear-maddened, fleeing the lengthening
N09 1610  6    shadow of death, he scrambled to his feet again. He
N09 1620  6    couldn't see; he was long past the point of coherent
N09 1630  2    thinking. Dimly, he heard laughter, hoots of derision,
N09 1630 10    but he could not read the racket properly. He could
N09 1640 10    not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes
N09 1650  7    ago, and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing
N09 1660  4    but the air.
N09 1660  7       He hated them too much to understand- the people
N09 1670  3    of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's
N09 1680  3    world. This, he was sure, was the way they would act;
N09 1700  1    laughing at a dying man, laughing as a man was beaten
N09 1700 12    to death. And nothing would be done about it. Nothing
N09 1710  8    unless ...
N09 1710 10       Donna! Donna, his young wife, the girl who was both
N09 1720 10    daughter and wife to him. Donna was like he was. She
N09 1730  9    lived by the rules, never compromising, never blinded
N09 1740  3    or diverted by circumstance. And Donna would-
N09 1750  1       When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's
N09 1750  9    house, in the office of Doctor Lord, the deputy's deceased
N09 1760  9    father.
