E01 0010  2       Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his
E01 0010 11    training secretly either because his parents don't
E01 0020  6    want sonny-boy to "lift all those old barbell things"
E01 0030  5    because "you'll stunt your growth" ... or because childish
E01 0040  5    taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey ... lookit Mr.
E01 0050  3    America ... whaddya gonna do with all those muscles
E01 0050 12    (of which he has none at the time)"?
E01 0060  8       After all, a guy's gotta have a little ego!
E01 0070  5       Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about
E01 0080  5    an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to
E01 0090  2    train in secret ... has never heard one unkind word
E01 0090 12    from his parents ... and never has been taunted by
E01 0100  8    his schoolmates!
E01 0110  1       This happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition
E01 0110  9    is our new Junior Mr. Canada- Henri de Courcy.
E01 0120  7       Far from discouraging Henri, his parents urge him
E01 0130  6    on to greater and greater accomplishments. Instead
E01 0140  2    of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally
E01 0150  2    took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority,
E01 0160  1    Professor Roland Claude.
E01 0160  4       And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better
E01 0170  4    hands because "le professeur" knows his muscles from
E01 0180  2    the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down
E01 0180 11    to the tibialis anticus of the leg ... and better still,
E01 0190  9    he knows just what exercises work best for them and
E01 0200  7    what Weider principles to combine them with for fast,
E01 0210  5    fast muscle growth.
E01 0210  8       That's because the good professor teaches only Weider
E01 0220  6    methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which
E01 0230  4    is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal. Undoubtedly
E01 0240  2    you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning
E01 0250  1    pupils (every pupil has a physique title of some kind
E01 0250 11    or other). There's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest
E01 0260  8    Mr. Canada ... Jean-Paul Senesac, whose story appeared
E01 0270  8    here two issues ago ... Jack Boissoneault, who was
E01 0280  6    with us last month ... Charles Harve, who recently
E01 0290  3    won the "Most Muscular Man" subdivision award in the
E01 0300  3    Mr. Canada event ... and a host of others. Yesiree
E01 0300 13    ... the professor knows his muscles!
E01 0310  6       Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall
E01 0320  8    and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, and his greatest
E01 0330  4    desire was to pack on some weight. About that time
E01 0340  1    he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and
E01 0350  2    he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight
E01 0350 12    gaining. Seeing so many illustrations and reading so
E01 0360  7    many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein,
E01 0370  7    those two wonder-working Weider food supplements, he
E01 0380  5    decided to try them and see what they could do for
E01 0390  4    him.
E01 0390  5       Well, sir ... they did real great! For in almost
E01 0400  3    less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight
E01 0400 13    was increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising
E01 0410  9    ... he's crazy about water skiing and swimming and
E01 0420  7    this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added
E01 0430  4    food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his
E01 0440  3    skinny frame.
E01 0440  5       Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming
E01 0450  1    and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them
E01 0450 11    very much. But he was totally dissatisfied with his
E01 0460  8    upper body. It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical.
E01 0470  5    "A real 'nothing' torso", says Henri. "It never seemed
E01 0480  5    to widen ... it just got longer and longer".
E01 0490  1       That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at
E01 0500  1    once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just
E01 0500 12    how to correct it. In his gym the professor has some
E01 0510  9    of the most "knocked out" equipment since Vic Tanny.
E01 0520  4    Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and
E01 0530  2    he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull
E01 0540  1    Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set
E01 0540 12    is a pressing or "pushing" movement which accents one
E01 0550  9    sector of a muscle group in a specific way, followed
E01 0560  9    by a "pulling" exercise which works the opposing sector
E01 0570  6    of the same muscle group.
E01 0570 11       So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous
E01 0580  9    "moon" bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull
E01 0590 10    Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm
E01 0600  7    Pullover (the "pull" part of the Push-Pull Super-Set)
E01 0610  5    which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly
E01 0620  2    affects the muscles of the upper back and chest ...
E01 0620 12    and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically
E01 0630  8    works on the chest to build those wide, Reeves-type
E01 0640  6    "gladiator" pecs, while stimulating the upper lats
E01 0650  4    and frontal deltoids.
E01 0650  7       As you can see, in this Push-Pull Super Set the
E01 0660  8    entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised
E01 0670  3    in alternate sectors by alternate exercises ... so
E01 0680  1    the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!
E01 0680 10       Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull
E01 0690  8    Super-Sets No. 1, the professor allows him about a
E01 0700  7    five-minute rest period before starting him on four
E01 0710  4    complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2.
E01 0710 11       Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises,
E01 0720  9    but this time done with dumbbells, and using both "moon"
E01 0730  7    and flat benches. The "push" exercise of this Push-Pull
E01 0740  6    Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well
E01 0750  4    pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of
E01 0760  1    the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.
E01 0760  9    You need the barbell variation to build width and mass
E01 0770  8    in the pecs ... the dumbbell variation develops a
E01 0780  4    most classically sculptured outline to the pecs.
E01 0790  1       The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell
E01 0800  1    Bent-Arm Pullover. (Note how strongly the upper lats
E01 0820  4    and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because
E01 0830  2    of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell
E01 0830 12    variation affords).
E01 0840  2       In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push" exercise
E01 0850  2    is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull"
E01 0860  1    exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent
E01 0860 10    arms.
E01 0870  1       The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest
E01 0870 10    pectoral-ribcage
E01 0880  1    stretcher ever invented! This is true only if a very
E01 0880 11    wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible
E01 0890  9    stretch is achieved. You'll know when you've made the
E01 0900  8    greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will
E01 0910  5    touch! As you see, the professor has designed a piece
E01 0920  3    of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e
E01 0930  6    grip ... he has to; he just can't do anything about
E01 0930 17    it at all!
E01 0940  2       But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise
E01 0950  1    at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder-
E01 0960  1    looks as though he were having the time of his life!
E01 0960 12       The last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed
E01 0970  6    program for Henri is a single exercise, done in individual
E01 0980  5    sets with a bit longer pause between sets. By this
E01 0990  4    time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is
E01 1000  2    pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes
E01 1000 11    time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping
E01 1010  9    work. He has Henri do from four to six sets of the
E01 1020  8    Incline Bench Press (note the high incline). This gives
E01 1030  3    a wide flare to the pecs, causing them to flow dramatically
E01 1040  2    upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into
E01 1040  9    the serratus and lats.
E01 1050  4       This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests
E01 1060  3    ... that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks
E01 1070  1    of the great champions.
E01 1070  5       So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1,
E01 1080  5    four of No. 2, four of No. 3 and four to six sets of
E01 1090  4    the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de
E01 1090 14    Courcy has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping,
E01 1100  9    torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon.
E01 1120  1    @
E01 1120  2       Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size
E01 1120 10    alone ... rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe
E01 1130 10    of true Herculean build. The aspects of physical development
E01 1140  7    that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence
E01 1150  6    their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the
E01 1160  6    true champion- superior definition of the muscles.
E01 1170  1       Now good definition is one thing that all of us
E01 1170 11    can acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight
E01 1180 10    workouts. But contest definition- that dramatic muscular
E01 1190  7    separation of every muscle group that seems as though
E01 1200  7    it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel- is
E01 1210  2    something quite different. This comes not alone from
E01 1220  2    high-set, high-rep training, but from certain
E01 1220 10    definition-specialization
E01 1230  1    exercises which the champion selects for himself with
E01 1230  9    the knowledge of exactly what works best for him.
E01 1240  8       Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders
E01 1250  6    but less spectacularly for others. Because they are
E01 1260  4    "minority" exercises and have but a limited appeal
E01 1270  2    they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten.
E01 1270 12    Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe rediscovers
E01 1290  1    them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted
E01 1290 10    with them and once again see how effective they really
E01 1300  8    are.
E01 1300  9       The exercise I shall discuss in this- the first
E01 1310  7    of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization
E01 1320  3    of a particular body part- is the One Leg Lunge. Why
E01 1330  4    it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say
E01 1340  1    because it works perfectly for everyone, no matter
E01 1340  9    whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths!
E01 1350  7       It is the one exercise that drastically influences
E01 1360  4    the definition of the thighs at the hipline- that mark
E01 1370  5    of the champion that sets him apart from all other
E01 1380  1    bodybuilders ... a criterion of muscle "drama" that
E01 1380  9    is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ...
E01 1390  7    the facet of muscular development that wins prizes.
E01 1400  4       Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is
E01 1410  3    quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters
E01 1410 11    which is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is
E01 1420  9    a split and all lifters practice this in their regular
E01 1430  8    workouts.
E01 1430  9       But for purely definition purposes- used in conjunction
E01 1440  7    with your regular Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor
E01 1450  6    programs- a heavy weight is not needed. Indeed, a lighter
E01 1460  6    weight works much better because a greater, more extensive
E01 1470  3    split can be performed. Used in several sets of high
E01 1480  2    reps once or twice each week it will not be long before
E01 1480 14    your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition
E01 1490  9    in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing
E01 1500  5    and twisting under the skin!
E01 1500 10       Really there is no reason why this fine exercise
E01 1510  9    should not find its way into your leg program at all
E01 1520  7    times, for the following suggestions show why it is
E01 1530  4    so effective:
E01 1530  6    _1._
E01 1530  7       It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise.
E01 1550  2    _2._
E01 1550  3       It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from
E01 1560  5    start to finish of each repetition.
E01 1560 11    _3._
E01 1560 12       It improves over-all balance and control for the
E01 1570  9    bodybuilder, and helps to make Squats more easily and
E01 1580  7    more correctly performed.
E01 1580 10    _4._
E01 1580 11       It increases flexibility of the legs.
E01 1590  6    _5._
E01 1590  7       It speeds muscle growth and power development even
E01 1600  5    for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg
E01 1610  5    is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated
E01 1620  1    effort to be focused on each.
E01 1620  7       You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine
E01 1630  6    exercise and here's the way it's done:
E01 1640  2    _1._
E01 1640  3       Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their
E01 1650  1    height so that this will correspond to the height of
E01 1650 11    your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as
E01 1660 10    for a heavy Clean.
E01 1660 14    _2._
E01 1660 15       Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp
E01 1670  8    the bar (which will rest against the back of your neck);
E01 1680  8    extend your feet forward and backward until you are
E01 1690  5    in a deep leg split.
E01 1690 10       Now raise the weight by straightening your front
E01 1700  5    leg, without moving your feet. When the front knee
E01 1710  6    is straight and locked, allow it to bend again until
E01 1720  5    you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the
E01 1730  1    sides of the Power Stands.
E01 1730  6    _3._
E01 1730  7       After you have taken a breather, reverse the position
E01 1740  4    of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous
E01 1750  4    exercise is now to the rear, and the rear thigh now
E01 1760  4    to the front, and perform the same movement in the
E01 1770  3    same manner.
E01 1770  5       That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell. You should
E01 1780  3    have a couple of training partners to stand by when
E01 1780 13    you make your first experiments ... just for safety.
E01 1800  6    You should also begin this exercise with a very light
E01 1810  7    barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise.
E01 1820  5       Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first.
E01 1830  3    But don't worry. Before your first training experiment
E01 1840  1    has ended there will be a big improvement and almost
E01 1840 11    before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself
E01 1850  7    just like a veteran!
E01 1860  1       Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the
E01 1860 11    back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't
E01 1870  9    make some experiments with the bar held in front of
E01 1880  8    the neck. Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters
E01 1890  4    would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations
E01 1900  2    providing that they remember to make alternate sets
E01 1900 10    with the left and right leg to the front.
