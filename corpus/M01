M01 0010  1       Now that he knew himself to be self he was free
M01 0010 12    to grok ever closer to his brothers, merge without
M01 0020  6    let. Self's integrity was and is and ever had been.
M01 0030  6    Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves, the
M01 0040  2    many threes-fulfilled on Mars, corporate and discorporate,
M01 0040 10    the precious few on Earth- the unknown powers of three
M01 0050  9    on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish
M01 0060  8    now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished
M01 0070  4    himself.
M01 0070  5       Mike remained in trance; there was much to grok,
M01 0080  5    loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing-
M01 0090  3    all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel
M01 0090 15    Foster Tabernacle (not just cusp when he and Digby
M01 0100  9    had come face to face alone) ... why Bishop Senator
M01 0110  5    Boone made him warily uneasy, how Miss Dawn Ardent
M01 0120  3    tasted like a water brother when she was not, the smell
M01 0130  1    of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping
M01 0130 10    up and down and wailing-
M01 0140  1       Jubal's conversations coming and going- Jubal's
M01 0150  1    words troubled him most; he studied them, compared
M01 0150  9    them with what he had been taught as a nestling, struggling
M01 0160  9    to bridge between languages, the one he thought with
M01 0170  6    and the one he was learning to think in. The word "church"
M01 0180  4    which turned up over and over again among Jubal's words
M01 0190  2    gave him knotty difficulty; there was no Martian concept
M01 0200  1    to match it- unless one took "church" and "worship"
M01 0200 10    and "God" and "congregation" and many other words and
M01 0210  9    equated them to the totality of the only world he had
M01 0220 10    known during growing-waiting ... then forced the concept
M01 0230  6    back into English in that phrase which had been rejected
M01 0240  4    (by each differently) by Jubal, by Mahmoud, by Digby.
M01 0250  1       "Thou art God". He was closer to understanding it
M01 0260  2    in English now, although it could never have the inevitability
M01 0260 12    of the Martian concept it stood for. In his mind he
M01 0270 11    spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian
M01 0280  7    word and felt closer grokking. Repeating it like a
M01 0290  5    student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus
M01 0300  2    he sank into nirvana.
M01 0300  6       Before midnight he speeded his heart, resumed normal
M01 0310  4    breathing, ran down his check list, uncurled and sat
M01 0320  2    up. He had been weary; now he felt light and gay and
M01 0320 14    clear-headed, ready for the many actions he saw spreading
M01 0330  9    out before him.
M01 0340  1       He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as
M01 0340 11    his earlier necessity for quiet. He stepped out into
M01 0350  7    the hall, was delighted to encounter a water brother.
M01 0360  4    "Hi"!
M01 0360  5       "Oh. Hello, Mike. My, you look chipper".
M01 0370  4       "I feel fine! Where is everybody"?
M01 0380  1       "Asleep. Ben and Stinky went home an hour ago and
M01 0380 11    people started going to bed".
M01 0390  5       "Oh". Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left;
M01 0400  5    he wanted to explain his new grokking.
M01 0410  1       "I ought to be asleep, too, but I felt like a snack.
M01 0410 13    Are you hungry"?
M01 0420  1       "Sure, I'm hungry"!
M01 0420  4       "Come on, there's some cold chicken and we'll see
M01 0430  7    what else". They went downstairs, loaded a tray lavishly.
M01 0440  5    "Let's take it outside. It's plenty warm".
M01 0450  3       "A fine idea", Mike agreed.
M01 0450  8       "Warm enough to swim- real Indian summer. I'll switch
M01 0460  9    on the floods".
M01 0470  1       "Don't bother", Mike answered. "I'll carry the tray".
M01 0480  2    He could see in almost total darkness. Jubal said that
M01 0480 12    his night-sight probably came from the conditions in
M01 0490  9    which he had grown up, and Mike grokked this was true
M01 0500  8    but grokked that there was more to it; his foster parents
M01 0510  5    had taught him to see. As for the night being warm,
M01 0520  2    he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest
M01 0520 11    but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes
M01 0530  9    in temperature and pressure; he was considerate of
M01 0540  6    their weakness, once he learned of it. But he was looking
M01 0550  6    forward to snow- seeing for himself that each tiny
M01 0560  2    crystal of the water of life was a unique individual,
M01 0560 12    as he had read- walking barefoot, rolling in it.
M01 0570  6       In the meantime he was pleased with the warm night
M01 0580  6    and the still more pleasing company of his water brother.
M01 0590  4       "Okay, take the tray. I'll switch on the underwater
M01 0600  3    lights. That'll be plenty to eat by".
M01 0600 10       "Fine". Mike liked having light up through the ripples;
M01 0610  9    it was a goodness, beauty. They picnicked by the pool,
M01 0620  7    then lay back on the grass and looked at stars.
M01 0630  5       "Mike, there's Mars. It is Mars, isn't it? Or Antares"?
M01 0640  5       "It is Mars".
M01 0650  1       "Mike? What are they doing on Mars"?
M01 0650  7       He hesitated; the question was too wide for the
M01 0660  8    sparse English language. "On the side toward the horizon-
M01 0670  5    the southern hemisphere- it is spring; plants are being
M01 0680  4    taught to grow".
M01 0680  7       "'Taught to grow'"?
M01 0690  1       He hesitated. "Larry teaches plants to grow. I have
M01 0700  1    helped him. But my people- Martians, I mean; I now
M01 0700 11    grok you are my people- teach plants another way. In
M01 0710  9    the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs,
M01 0720  7    those who stayed alive through the summer, are being
M01 0740  3    brought into nests for quickening and more growing".
M01 0740 11    He thought. "Of the humans we left at the equator,
M01 0750 10    one has discorporated and the others are sad".
M01 0760  6       Yes, I heard it in the news".
M01 0770  1       Mike had not heard it; he had not known it until
M01 0770 12    asked. "They should not be sad. Mr. Booker T. W. Jones
M01 0780 11    Food Technician First Class is not sad; the Old Ones
M01 0790  9    have cherished him".
M01 0800  1       "You knew him"?
M01 0800  4       "Yes. He had his own face, dark and beautiful. But
M01 0810  5    he was homesick".
M01 0810  8       "Oh, dear! Mike ... do you ever get homesick? For
M01 0820  9    Mars"?
M01 0820 10       "At first I was homesick", he answered. "I was lonely
M01 0830 10    always". He rolled toward her and took her in his arms.
M01 0840 10    "But now I am not lonely. I grok I shall never be lonely
M01 0850  8    again".
M01 0850  9       "Mike darling"- They kissed, and went on kissing.
M01 0860  9       Presently his water brother said breathlessly. "Oh,
M01 0870  5    my! That was almost worse than the first time".
M01 0880  4       "You are all right, my brother"?
M01 0890  1       "Yes. Yes indeed. Kiss me again".
M01 0890  7       A long time later, by cosmic clock, she said, "Mike?
M01 0900  7    Is that- I mean, 'Do you know'"-
M01 0910  3       "I know. It is for growing closer. Now we grow closer".
M01 0920  3       "Well ... I've been ready a long time- goodness,
M01 0930  4    we all have, but ... never mind, dear; turn just a
M01 0930 15    little. I'll help".
M01 0940  3       As they merged, grokking together, Mike said softly
M01 0950  3    and triumphantly: "Thou art God".
M01 0950  8       Her answer was not in words. Then, as their grokking
M01 0960  9    made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost
M01 0970  6    ready to discorporate her voice called him back: "Oh!
M01 0980  4    ... Oh! Thou art God"!
M01 0980  9       "We grok God".
M01 0990  3    #XXV.#
M01 0990  4    On Mars humans were building pressure domes for the
M01 1000  4    male and female party that would arrive by next ship.
M01 1000 14    This went faster than scheduled as the Martians were
M01 1010  9    helpful. Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary
M01 1020  9    estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen
M01 1030  6    in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly
M01 1040  2    to future human generations.
M01 1040  6       The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan;
M01 1050  6    time was not yet. Their meditations were approaching
M01 1060  3    a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many
M01 1070  2    millennia. On Earth elections continued and a very
M01 1070 10    advanced poet published a limited edition of verse
M01 1080  7    consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces;
M01 1090  4    Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation
M01 1100  3    Assembly Daily Record should be translated into the
M01 1110  2    medium.
M01 1110  3       A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs
M01 1120  1    of plants and Mrs. Joseph ("Shadow of Greatness") Douglas
M01 1130  1    was quoted as saying: "I would no more sit down without
M01 1130 12    flowers on my table than without serviettes". A Tibetan
M01 1140  9    swami from Palermo, Sicily, announced in Beverly Hills
M01 1150  6    a newly discovered, ancient yoga discipline for ripple
M01 1160  5    breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction
M01 1170  3    between sexes. His chelas were required to assume the
M01 1190  1    matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while
M01 1190  9    he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined
M01 1200  9    their purses in another room- nothing was stolen; the
M01 1210  5    purpose was less immediate.
M01 1220  1       The President of the United States proclaimed the
M01 1220  9    first Sunday in November as "National Grandmothers'
M01 1230  6    Day" and urged America to say it with flowers. A funeral
M01 1240  8    parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting. Fosterite
M01 1250  2    bishops, after secret conclave, announced the Church's
M01 1260  2    second Major Miracle: Supreme Bishop Digby had been
M01 1270  1    translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel,
M01 1270 10    ranking with-but-after Archangel Foster. The glorious
M01 1280  8    news had been held up pending Heavenly confirmation
M01 1290  4    of the elevation of a new Supreme Bishop, Huey Short-
M01 1300  3    a candidate accepted by the Boone faction after lots
M01 1310  2    had been cast repeatedly.
M01 1310  6       L'Unita and Hoy published identical denunciations
M01 1320  3    of Short's elevation, l'Osservatore Romano and the
M01 1330  4    Christian Science Monitor ignored it, Times of India
M01 1340  4    snickered at it, and the Manchester Guardian simply
M01 1350  2    reported it- the Fosterites in England were few but
M01 1350 11    extremely militant.
M01 1360  2       Digby was not pleased with his promotion. The Man
M01 1370  2    from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished-
M01 1370 12    and that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse
M01 1380  9    it up. Foster listened with angelic patience until
M01 1390  5    Digby ran down, then said, "Listen, junior, you're
M01 1400  3    an angel now- so forget it. Eternity is no time for
M01 1410  1    recriminations. You too were a stupid jackass until
M01 1410  9    you poisoned me. Afterwards you did well enough. Now
M01 1420  7    that Short is Supreme Bishop he'll do all right, he
M01 1430  6    can't help it. Same as with the Popes. Some of them
M01 1440  4    were warts until they got promoted. Check with one
M01 1440 13    of them, go ahead- there's no professional jealousy
M01 1450  8    here".
M01 1460  1       Digby calmed down, but made one request.
M01 1460  8       Foster shook his halo. "You can't touch him. You
M01 1470  6    shouldn't have tried to. Oh, you can submit a requisition
M01 1480  5    for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself.
M01 1490  2    But, I'm telling you, it'll be turned down- you don't
M01 1500  1    understand the System yet. The Martians have their
M01 1500  9    own setup, different from ours, and as long as they
M01 1510  8    need him, we can't touch him. They run their show their
M01 1520  6    way- the Universe has variety, something for everybody-
M01 1530  3    a fact you field workers often miss".
M01 1530 10       "You mean this punk can brush me aside and I've
M01 1540 10    got to hold still for it"?
M01 1550  2       "I held still for the same thing, didn't I? I'm
M01 1560  2    helping you now, am I not? Now look, there's work to
M01 1560 13    be done and lots of it. The Boss wants performance,
M01 1570 10    not gripes. If you need a Day off to calm down, duck
M01 1580  9    over to the Muslim Paradise and take it. Otherwise,
M01 1590  4    straighten your halo, square your wings, and dig in.
M01 1600  2    The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll
M01 1600 12    feel angelic. Get Happy, junior"!
M01 1610  4       Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh. "Okay, I'm Happy.
M01 1620  4    Where do I start"?
M01 1620  8       Jubal did not hear of Digby's disappearance when
M01 1630  7    it was announced, and, when he did, while he had a
M01 1640  7    fleeting suspicion, he dismissed it; if Mike had had
M01 1650  3    a finger in it, he had gotten away with it- and what
M01 1650 15    happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all
M01 1660  9    as long as he wasn't bothered.
M01 1670  2       His household had gone through an upset. Jubal deduced
M01 1680  1    what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't
M01 1680 12    want to inquire. Mike was of legal age and presumed
M01 1690 10    able to defend himself in the clinches. Anyhow, it
M01 1700  6    was high time the boy was salted.
M01 1710  1       Jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way
M01 1710  9    the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting- ABC
M01 1720  6    vs D, then BCD vs A ... or AB vs CD, or AD
M01 1740  1    vs CB, through all ways that four women can gang
M01 1750 10    up on each other.
M01 1760  2       This continued most of the week following that ill-starred
M01 1770  1    trip to church, during which period Mike stayed in
M01 1770 10    his room and usually in a trance so deep that Jubal
M01 1780  8    would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before.
M01 1790  7    Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone
M01 1800  4    to pieces. The girls seemed to spend half their time
M01 1800 14    tiptoeing in "to see if Mike was all right" and they
M01 1810 11    were too preoccupied to cook, much less be secretaries.
M01 1820  7    Even rock-steady Anne- Hell, Anne was the worst! Absent-minded,
M01 1830  7    subject to unexplained tears ... Jubal would have bet
M01 1840  6    his life that if Anne were to witness the Second Coming,
M01 1850  3    she would memorize date, time, personae, events, and
M01 1860  1    barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes.
