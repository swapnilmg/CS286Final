G65 0010  1    The fall of Rome, the discovery of precious metals,
G65 0010 10    and the Protestant Reformation were all links and could
G65 0020  7    only be explained and understood by comprehending the
G65 0030  4    links that preceded and those that followed.
G65 0040  1       Often the historian must consider the use of intuition
G65 0040 10    or instinct by those individuals or nations which he
G65 0050  8    is studying. Unconsciously, governments or races or
G65 0060  5    institutions may enter into some undertaking without
G65 0070  2    fully realizing why they are doing so. They react in
G65 0070 12    obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been
G65 0080 10    impelled by natural law. A court may strike down a
G65 0090  8    law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law
G65 0100  4    is inimical to the numerical majority. A nation may
G65 0110  1    go to war on some trifling pretext, when in reality
G65 0110 11    it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct
G65 0120  6    that its very life was at stake. When the historian
G65 0130  3    encounters a situation in which he can perceive no
G65 0130 12    visible cause and effect sequence, he should be alert
G65 0140  9    to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides.
G65 0150  5       Adams firmly contended that the historian must never
G65 0160  6    underrate the impact of the geographical environment
G65 0170  2    on history. Here was another indispensable tool. Indeed,
G65 0180  1    he concluded that "geographical conditions have exercised
G65 0180  8    a great, possibly a preponderating, influence over
G65 0190  6    man's destiny". The failure of Greece to reach the
G65 0200  6    imperial destiny that Periclean Athens had seemed to
G65 0210  4    promise was almost directly attributable to her physical
G65 0220  1    conformation. All areas of history were either favorably
G65 0220  9    or adversely affected by the geographical environment,
G65 0230  6    and no respectable historian could pursue the study
G65 0240  5    of history without a thorough knowledge of geography.
G65 0250  2       Brooks Adams was consistent in his admonishments
G65 0260  1    to historians about the necessary tools or insights
G65 0260  9    they needed to possess. However, as a practicing historian,
G65 0270  6    he, himself, has left few clues to the amount of professional
G65 0280  6    scholarship that he used when writing history. In fact,
G65 0290  4    if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness
G65 0300  1    of his historicism, they must be based on scanty evidence.
G65 0300 11    What evidence is available would seem to indicate that
G65 0310  8    Brooks, unlike his older brother Henry, had most of
G65 0320  6    the methodological vices usually found in the amateur.
G65 0330  4    A credulousness, a distaste for documentation, an uncritical
G65 0340  1    reliance on contemporary accounts, and a proneness
G65 0340  8    to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was
G65 0350  9    provided were all evidences of his failure to comprehend
G65 0360  6    the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the
G65 0370  2    responsibilities of the historian to his reading public.
G65 0370 10    This is not to assume that his work was without merit,
G65 0380 11    but the validity of his assumptions concerning the
G65 0390  6    meaning of history must always be considered against
G65 0400  3    this background of an unprofessional approach.
G65 0410  1       His credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his
G65 0410  9    introduction to The Emancipation of Massachusetts,
G65 0420  4    which purports to examine the trials of Moses and to
G65 0430  6    draw a parallel between the leader of the Israelite
G65 0440  1    exodus from Egypt and the leadership of the Puritan
G65 0440 10    clergy in colonial New England. Much criticism has
G65 0450  7    been leveled at this rather forced analogy, but what
G65 0460  5    is equally significant is Adams' complete acceptance
G65 0470  2    of the Biblical record as "good and trustworthy history".
G65 0480  1    In light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by
G65 0480  9    the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement,
G65 0490  8    particularly coming from one who was well known for
G65 0500  8    his antifundamentalist views. The desire to substantiate
G65 0510  3    a thesis at the expense of sound research technique
G65 0520  1    smacks more of the propagandist than the historian.
G65 0530  6       A similar amateurish characteristic is revealed
G65 0540  4    in Adams' failure to check the accuracy and authenticity
G65 0550  4    of his informational sources. If he found data that
G65 0560  2    fitted his general plan, he used it and counted his
G65 0560 12    sources trustworthy. Conversely, if statistics were
G65 0570  5    uncovered which contradicted a cherished theory, the
G65 0580  5    sources were denounced as faulty. Such manipulations
G65 0590  1    are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression
G65 0600  1    of the monasteries during the English reformation.
G65 0600  8    Adams depended largely on the dispatches of foreign
G65 0610  6    ambassadors and observers in England, claiming that
G65 0620  3    the reports of such agents had to be accurate because
G65 0630  1    there were no newspapers. This is certainly an irrational
G65 0630 10    dogmatism, in which the modern mind attempts to understand
G65 0640  9    the spirit of the sixteenth century on twentieth-century
G65 0650  5    terms. Moreover, he rejects the contemporary accounts
G65 0660  3    of Englishmen, casually adjudging them to be distorted
G65 0670  1    by prejudice because "the opinions of Englishmen are
G65 0670  9    of no great value". What is exposited by this observation
G65 0680  9    is not the inherent prejudices of Englishmen but the
G65 0690  6    Anglophobia of Brooks Adams.
G65 0700  1       In all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made
G65 0700 11    no pretense at being an impartial historian. Impartiality
G65 0710  7    to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to
G65 0720  5    search for a synthesis. He deplored the impact of German
G65 0730  4    historiography on the writing of history, terming it
G65 0740  2    a "dismal monster". Ranke and his disciples had reduced
G65 0740 11    history to a profession of dullness; Brooks Adams preferred
G65 0750  9    the chronicles of Froissart or the style and theorizing
G65 0760  8    of Edward Gibbon, for at least they took a stand on
G65 0770  8    the issues about which they wrote. He wrote eloquently
G65 0780  2    to William James that impartial history was not only
G65 0790  1    impossible but undesirable. If the historian was convinced
G65 0790  9    of his own correctness, then he should not allow his
G65 0800  8    vision to become fogged by disturbing facts. It was
G65 0810  5    history that must be in error, not the historian. It
G65 0820  2    was this basic trait that separated Adams from the
G65 0820 11    ranks of professional historians and led him to commit
G65 0830  9    time and time again what was his most serious offense
G65 0840  6    against the historical method- namely, the tendency
G65 0850  3    to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting
G65 0860  1    it to the test of facts.
G65 0860  7       All of Adams' work reflects this dogmatic characteristic.
G65 0870  3    No page seems to be complete without the statement
G65 0880  1    of at least one unproved generalization. One example
G65 0880  9    of this was his assertion that "... all servile revolts
G65 0890  9    must be dealt with by physical force". There is no
G65 0900  6    explanation of terms nor a qualification that most
G65 0910  3    such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a
G65 0910 13    bald dogmatism that they must, because of some undefined
G65 0920  9    compulsion, be so repelled. On matters of race he was
G65 0930  9    similarly inflexible: "Most of the modern Latin races
G65 0940  6    seem to have inherited ... the rigidity of the Roman
G65 0950  4    mind". He cites the French Revolution as typifying
G65 0960  1    this rigidity but makes no mention of the Italians,
G65 0960 10    who have been able to adapt to all types of circumstances.
G65 0980  7    He pontificates that "one of the first signs of advancing
G65 0990  7    civilization is the fall in the value of women in men's
G65 1000  5    eyes". It made no difference that most evidence points
G65 1010  2    to an opposite conclusion. For Adams had made up his
G65 1010 12    mind before all the facts were available.
G65 1020  6       All critics of Adams and his methods have observed
G65 1030  5    this particular deficiency. J. T. Shotwell was appalled
G65 1040  3    by such spurious history as that which attributed the
G65 1050  1    fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade,
G65 1050 10    and he urged Adams to "transform his essay into a real
G65 1060  8    history, embodying not merely those facts which fit
G65 1070  5    into his theory, but also the modifications and exceptions".
G65 1080  3    A. M. Wergeland called the Adams method literally antihistorical,
G65 1090  2    while Clive Day maintained that the assumptions were
G65 1100  2    not confined to theories alone but were also applicable
G65 1100 11    to straight factual evidence. Moreover, stated Day,
G65 1110  6    "He always omits facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis".
G65 1120  8    Even D. A. Wasson, who compared The Emancipation of
G65 1130  6    Massachusetts to the lifting of a fog from ancient
G65 1140  6    landscapes, was also forced to admit the methodological
G65 1150  1    deficiencies of the author.
G65 1150  5       In summary, Brooks Adams felt that the nature of
G65 1160  6    history was order and that the order so discovered
G65 1170  1    was as much subject to historical laws as the forces
G65 1170 11    of nature. Moreover, he believed that most professional
G65 1180  7    historians lacked some of the essential instruments
G65 1190  5    for a proper study of history. However, despite the
G65 1200  3    insight of many of his observations, his own conclusions
G65 1210  1    are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ
G65 1210 11    at all times the correct research methods. This should
G65 1220  6    not prejudice an evaluation of his findings, but they
G65 1230  5    were not the findings of a completely impartial investigator.
G65 1240  2    What was perhaps more important than his concept of
G65 1250  1    the nature of history and the historical method were
G65 1250 10    those forces which shaped the direction of his thought.
G65 1260  7    In the final analysis his contribution to American
G65 1270  3    historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights
G65 1280  1    into religion, economics, and Darwinism, the three
G65 1280  8    factors which conditioned his search for a law of history.
G65 1290  9    #RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERNATURALISM#
G65 1300  1    Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant
G65 1310  1    manifestation of man's fear of the unknown. But it
G65 1310 10    was nothing more than that. Religion and the churches
G65 1320  8    were institutions which had been created by man, not
G65 1330  7    God. He did not deny God; he simply did not believe
G65 1340  4    that a Creator intervened or interfered in human affairs.
G65 1350  2    The historian need not be concerned with the philosophical
G65 1350 11    problems suggested by religion. There was no evidence,
G65 1360  8    either of a positive or negative type, of the actions
G65 1370  7    of a Divine Being in this world; and, since the historian
G65 1380  5    should only be interested in strictly terrestrial activity,
G65 1390  2    his research should eliminate the supernatural. Furthermore,
G65 1400  1    he must regard religion as the expression of human
G65 1400 10    forces. Certainly, he must recognize its power and
G65 1410  8    attempt to ascertain its influence on the flow of history,
G65 1420  7    but he must not confuse the natural and the mundane
G65 1430  4    with the divine.
G65 1430  7       Adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed
G65 1440  4    that the worship of an unseen power was in reality
G65 1450  1    a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment.
G65 1450 11    Students of anthropology and comparative religion had
G65 1460  7    long been aware that there was, indeed, a direct connection.
G65 1470  7    But Adams was one of the first to suggest that this
G65 1480  5    human incompetence was the only motivating factor behind
G65 1490  2    religion. It was this fear which explained the development
G65 1500  1    of a priestly caste whose function in society was to
G65 1500 11    mollify and appease the angry deities. To keep themselves
G65 1510  7    entrenched in power, the priests were forced to demonstrate
G65 1520  6    their unique status through the miracle. It was the
G65 1530  4    use of the supernatural that kept them in business.
G65 1540  1    The German barbarians of the fourth century offered
G65 1540  9    an excellent example:
G65 1550  1       "The Germans in the fourth century were a very simple
G65 1560  1    race, who comprehended little of natural laws, and
G65 1560  9    who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand
G65 1570  6    to supernatural intervention. This intervention could
G65 1580  4    only be controlled by priests, and thus the invasions
G65 1590  2    caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred
G65 1590 12    class. The power of every ecclesiastical organization
G65 1600  6    has always rested on the miracle, and the clergy have
G65 1610  6    always proved their divine commission as did Elijah".
G65 1620  3       Adams contended that once such a special class had
G65 1630  2    been created it became a vested interest and sought
G65 1630 11    to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over
G65 1640  7    the relationships between God and man. Thus, the Church
G65 1650  7    was born and because of its intrinsic character was
G65 1660  3    soon identified as a conservative institution, determined
G65 1670  1    to resist the forces of change, to identify itself
G65 1670 10    with the political rulers, and to maintain a kind of
G65 1680  8    splendid isolation from the masses. Doctrine was not
G65 1690  4    only mysterious; it was also sacred, "and no believer
G65 1700  2    in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons
G65 1700 11    examined as we should examine human laws". These basic
G65 1710  9    ideas concerning the nature of religion were, Adams
G65 1720  6    believed, some of the major keys to the understanding
G65 1730  3    of history and the movement of society. The dark views
G65 1740  1    about the Puritans found in The Emancipation of Massachusetts
G65 1750  1    were never altered.
G65 1750  4       Despite their adherence to the status quo, the forces
G65 1760  4    of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments
G65 1770  1    as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge.
G65 1770  7    In The Law of Civilization and Decay Brooks Adams traced
G65 1780  9    this evolution, always pointing to the fact that although
G65 1790  8    the forms became more rational, the substance remained
G65 1800  5    unchanged. The relic worship and monasticism of the
G65 1810  3    Middle Ages were more advanced forms than were primitive
G65 1820  1    fetish worship and nature myths. Yet, the idea imbedded
G65 1820 10    in each was identical: to surround the unknown with
G65 1830  8    mystery and to isolate that class which had been given
G65 1840  6    special dominion over the secrets of God. To Adams
G65 1850  3    that age in which religion exercised power over the
G65 1850 12    entire culture of the race was one of imagination,
G65 1860  9    and it is largely the admiration he so obviously held
G65 1870  6    for such eras that betrays a peculiar religiosity-
G65 1880  1    a sentiment he would have probably denied.
