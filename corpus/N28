N28 0010  1       On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers
N28 0010 11    stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise.
N28 0020  8    She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly
N28 0030  5    and kept her green, somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on
N28 0040  4    a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a
N28 0040 14    5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck.
N28 0050  8       The youth with the snake had a natural pride and
N28 0060  8    joy of life which appealed to the woman. Lithe and
N28 0070  3    muscular, he had well-molded features, and his light
N28 0080  1    color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate
N28 0080 11    with the slave women of his family.
N28 0090  5       The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished,
N28 0100  1    hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: "Look
N28 0110  1    at your watch, Col. Garvier. It is almost time for
N28 0110 11    and calinda to begin".
N28 0120  3       Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most
N28 0130  2    important and enlightened slave owners. He chuckled
N28 0130  9    and gave the signal for the dance to start. The slaves
N28 0140 10    ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered
N28 0150  6    around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name.
N28 0160  3       Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones
N28 0170  2    against the gourd which served as his drum. He showed
N28 0170 12    his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently,
N28 0180  7    his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook
N28 0190  5    and trembled in ecstasy.
N28 0190  9       The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity
N28 0200  7    as the dancers began the calinda, a sensual gyration
N28 0210  4    which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners
N28 0220  1    and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds.
N28 0220  9    The dance was of Haitian origin.
N28 0230  6       The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped
N28 0240  4    the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about
N28 0250  2    30, who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows. He
N28 0250 11    was possessive in his manner and, though a slave, obviously
N28 0260  9    was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners
N28 0270  6    of his owners. He proudly wore the blue livery of her
N28 0280  5    house, for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie, wife
N28 0290  2    of the prominent surgeon, Dr. Louis Lalaurie, who bore
N28 0290 11    one of the South's oldest and most cherished names.
N28 0300  9       Delphine was a pace-setter in high society. She
N28 0310  8    was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious
N28 0320  5    hostesses. Although New Orleans was not to learn of
N28 0330  4    it for a spell, she also was a sadist, a nymphomaniac
N28 0330 15    and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the
N28 0340  9    worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American
N28 0350  6    soil.
N28 0350  7       Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward
N28 0360  7    the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing
N28 0370  4    with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders.
N28 0380  1    The slender, handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon
N28 0380  9    by the other slaves. He was gifted with animal magnetism
N28 0390 10    and a potent allure for women of any race. But Dandy
N28 0400  8    had had little experience with girls on his master's
N28 0410  5    plantation in Bayou St. John.
N28 0410 10       Shy, actually, he avoided feminine overtures and
N28 0420  7    seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they
N28 0430  7    sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields,
N28 0440  4    in carriages and in boathouses.
N28 0440  9       This young slave was therefore quite unprepared
N28 0450  5    when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him
N28 0460  5    to draw near. The woman eyed the youth with the avidity
N28 0470  2    a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon
N28 0470 11    which is not yet in his collection.
N28 0480  6       "What is your name, boy? Come a bit closer. I won't
N28 0490  6    bite, you know".
N28 0490  9       He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris
N28 0500  6    perfume which emanated from her. Then he smiled shyly.
N28 0510  4    "My name is Dandy Brandon, missy. I belong to Master
N28 0520  3    Alexander Prieur".
N28 0520  5       She said with intense feeling: "Come near, let me
N28 0530  5    feel your arms. You look quite strong and healthy to
N28 0540  3    me, Dandy".
N28 0540  5       Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward
N28 0550  4    her waiting carriage. Lifting her skirts, she climbed
N28 0560  1    in, never relinquishing her grip on his arm. The woman
N28 0560 11    seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on
N28 0570  8    the floor in a torpor.
N28 0580  1       Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau, she
N28 0580  8    drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled
N28 0590  7    youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved
N28 0600  3    for army inductees. Satisfied at last, and after a
N28 0610  3    few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine
N28 0610 12    that Dandy was capable of learning new arts, she opened
N28 0620 10    the window and called to her liveried driver. This
N28 0630  6    was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling,
N28 0640  5    shaggy eyebrows.
N28 0640  7       "Aristide! I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at
N28 0650  6    once and give him this money for the boy's purchase.
N28 0660  3    There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack. If the old
N28 0670  2    fool argues about the price, tell him I shall order
N28 0670 12    my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer.
N28 0680 10    Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings.
N28 0690  6    Besides, he owns 300 slaves. One less shouldn't matter
N28 0700  4    to him".
N28 0700  6       Aristide Devol, the sardonic manservant who had
N28 0710  4    been brought in chains years before from his native
N28 0720  1    Sierra Leone, smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed
N28 0720 10    beaver hat. His bold eyes raked the woman, and a perceptive
N28 0730 11    spectator might sense that there was more to their
N28 0740  8    relationship than that of slave to owner.
N28 0750  2       "Another youth, Madame"? the coachman said softly.
N28 0760  1    "This one is a tender chicken, oui? Such delicate beauty,
N28 0770  1    such fine flesh. It will rip and shred easily for Madame".
N28 0780  1       "Be quiet, Devol! You are forgetting your place".
N28 0780  8       The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of
N28 0790  9    Alexander Prieur. Delphine Lalaurie took the reins
N28 0800  5    in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon- cowering
N28 0810  2    in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at
N28 0820  2    677 Perdido Street.
N28 0820  5       Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head
N28 0830  5    of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached
N28 0840  1    the pillared mansion. Dandy, curiosity overcoming his
N28 0840  8    apprehensions, peered out at the doctor from the window
N28 0850  9    of the vehicle. He saw a pint-sized man with a graying
N28 0860  9    spade beard and an unusually large head. Dr. Lalaurie
N28 0870  4    wore a maroon smoking jacket, and his myopic eyes were
N28 0880  3    blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses.
N28 0880 10    He was about 50 years old.
N28 0890  5       "Another young man, my dear? Really, you are most
N28 0900  4    indiscreet to drive him here yourself", he said, frowning
N28 0910  1    with displeasure.
N28 0910  3       Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss, and the
N28 0920  3    physician pecked it like a timid rooster.
N28 0920 10       "Dandy is to be our house guest, Louis. I want the
N28 0930 10    room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual
N28 0940  8    lad, quite precocious in many ways. He deserves a better
N28 0950  4    life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation".
N28 0960  1       "Quite so, my dear. His room will be ready shortly".
N28 0970  1       The physician led the horses to the stable after
N28 0970 10    a cursory glance at the cringing slave. Had Dandy been
N28 0980  9    older or wiser, instinct might have warned him that
N28 0990  6    he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries'
N28 1000  2    tender care if he valued his life.
N28 1000  9       But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume. Besides,
N28 1010  7    her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been
N28 1020  6    new and stirring experiences to the simple youth. Also,
N28 1030  3    he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony.
N28 1040  1       So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with
N28 1040  9    Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to
N28 1050  9    the attic room which was to be his new home. Airless
N28 1060  6    and dingy though it was, the attic represented luxury
N28 1070  2    to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers
N28 1070 14    and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou
N28 1080 10    St. John.
N28 1090  1       He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was
N28 1090 10    even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie- after closing
N28 1100  6    the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed
N28 1120  7    for something other than slumber.
N28 1130  1       It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed
N28 1130 11    himself to the hilt that first evening, for the room
N28 1140  8    was to become his prison cell. When he finally left
N28 1150  5    the sinister mansion on Perdido Street, he was carried
N28 1160  2    out in a coroner's basket.
N28 1160  7    ##
N28 1160  8    JUST six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the
N28 1170  6    mansion, the little surgeon and his svelte young wife
N28 1180  5    gave their annual open house and ball, to which only
N28 1190  2    New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited.
N28 1200  1       A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted
N28 1200  9    palms, and Delphine circulated graciously among her
N28 1210  5    guests, chatting airily of the forthcoming races, the
N28 1220  4    latest fashions from Paris, and Louisiana politics.
N28 1240  1       Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs, a despairing
N28 1250  1    boyish shriek, and the strains of the waltz faltered
N28 1250 10    and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition
N28 1260  7    descending the marble staircase.
N28 1270  1       It was Dandy Brandon, clad only in a bloody loincloth,
N28 1280  1    emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing
N28 1280 10    hard on him. The lad's once superb body was a mass
N28 1290  8    of scars and welts. His pinched face showed the ravages
N28 1300  5    of malnutrition.
N28 1300  7       Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie
N28 1310  6    and shouted: "Evil woman! You did this ... you like
N28 1320  7    to hurt ... to beat people ... I want ... to go home".
N28 1330  4       These were the last words he ever uttered. Convulsively,
N28 1340  1    he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of
N28 1340 12    Senator Gaston Berche, crimsoning the frilly shirt
N28 1350  7    and waistcoat the politician wore.
N28 1360  2       Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the
N28 1370  2    slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him
N28 1370 11    dead. The ball broke up in confusion. Guests stared
N28 1380  7    with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures.
N28 1390  5    Delphine stood like stone, her eyes alive with hate
N28 1400  3    as she looked down at the sheeted corpse.
N28 1400 11       But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright
N28 1410  8    story.
N28 1420  1       "I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities
N28 1420 10    and felt sorry for him. It was our hope to educate
N28 1430  9    him and to give him his freedom when the right time
N28 1440  5    came, for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed
N28 1450  2    worthy of our interest. After I paid Monsieur Prieur
N28 1450 11    for Dandy, I brought him home, but he was ill at ease
N28 1460 12    and ran away the same night. How he returned in such
N28 1470  8    a ghastly condition, or why, I cannot say. Dr. Lalaurie
N28 1480  5    and I didn't even know he was in the house until the
N28 1490  4    night of our ball when he came down the stairs".
N28 1500  1       She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief
N28 1500 11    and said with obvious emotion: "That poor boy! He must
N28 1510  9    have fallen in with evil companions, for he was a simple
N28 1520  9    youth and quite trusting and inexperienced. Ruffians
N28 1530  3    must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him
N28 1540  2    back to our house to die. Such a pitiful end"!
N28 1540 12       Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled
N28 1550  9    the coroner's panel, Dandy's accusation was adjudged
N28 1560  6    an aberration by the jury and disregarded. The Lalauries
N28 1570  5    were at the top rung of the social ladder, and even
N28 1580  3    a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity
N28 1590  1    of so illustrious a lady. Moreover, runaway slaves
N28 1590  9    frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans'
N28 1600  6    dives.
N28 1600  7       So the verict was "death at the hands of a person
N28 1610  8    or persons unknown", and the elite of the city, accepting
N28 1620  5    Delphine's testimony, welcomed her and the doctor back
N28 1630  3    into the fold. Once again life went its serene way-
N28 1630 13    soirees, fox hunts, balls and dinners.
N28 1640  6       The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated
N28 1650  4    and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed
N28 1660  3    her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing
N28 1670  1    cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county
N28 1670 10    hospital. Then, on July 2, there occurred another incident
N28 1680  8    which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip.
N28 1690  6       Mrs. Victor Dominique, socially prominent and a
N28 1700  4    neighbor of the Lalauries, chanced to glance out of
N28 1710  1    her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an
N28 1710 11    amazing sight. The manservant Devol and his mistress,
N28 1720  6    Delphine Lalaurie, were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon
N28 1730  6    of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the
N28 1740  4    Lalaurie mansion. The girl was not more than 16. She
N28 1750  1    was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of
N28 1750 11    black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her
N28 1760  7    back.
N28 1760  8       The bleeding girl was tiring fast; the coachman
N28 1770  5    and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down
N28 1780  2    Perdido Street.
N28 1780  4       The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice:
N28 1790  3    "Help me, somebody! They have pulled out all my teeth
N28 1800  3    and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw!
