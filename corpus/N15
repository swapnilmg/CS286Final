N15 0010  1    Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry
N15 0010 10    out the assigned missions. And Sweeney Squadron put
N15 0020  6    its first marks on the combat record. Every plane that
N15 0030  5    could fly was sent into the air.
N15 0040  1       Cricket took eight ships and went south across the
N15 0040 10    Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan.
N15 0050  8    Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target.
N15 0060  6    Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf
N15 0070  2    area, with his main task to get any kamikaze before
N15 0070 12    they got to the ships. Greg himself took two flights,
N15 0080 10    with Todman leading the second, to patrol and look
N15 0090  7    for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east
N15 0100  5    coast of Leyte. Each plane carried two five-hundred
N15 0110  1    pound bombs.
N15 0110  3       A weapons carrier took Greg, Todman, Belton, Banjo
N15 0120  2    Ferguson, and Walters and the others the two miles
N15 0120 11    from the bivouac area to the strip. It was a rough
N15 0130 10    long ride through the mud and pot holes. No one had
N15 0140  7    much to say. The sky glowered down at them. There was
N15 0150  3    a feeling that this mission would be canceled like
N15 0150 12    all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of
N15 0160 10    combat would go on forever.
N15 0170  1       The truck dropped them off at the various revetments
N15 0170 10    spread through the jungle. Donovan snatched Greg's
N15 0180  7    chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost
N15 0190  6    ran to the plane with it. His face was dark as the
N15 0200  4    sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for
N15 0200 16    his pilot. Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as
N15 0210  9    if he had never been in one before. But his hands and
N15 0220  8    those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and
N15 0230  3    arranging in the check-out procedure.
N15 0230  9       "I've got her as neat as I can", Donovan said, as
N15 0240 11    he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's
N15 0250  7    shoulders. "But this goddamn climate. It's for carabao
N15 0260  5    not airplanes".
N15 0260  7       "We'll make out. Don't you worry, chief", Greg replied,
N15 0270  8    wondering if he himself believed it.
N15 0280  3       "Yeah. See you", Donovan said as he jumped off the
N15 0290  3    wing. The expression was his trade-mark, his open sesame
N15 0290 13    to good luck, and his prayer that pilot and plane would
N15 0300 11    always return. At the prearranged time, Greg started
N15 0310  7    the engine and taxied out. From the time the chocks
N15 0320  5    were pulled until the plane was out of sight, he knew
N15 0330  3    Donovan would keep his back to the strip. He wondered
N15 0330 13    where the superstition had originated that it was bad
N15 0340  9    luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on
N15 0350  8    a combat mission. Yet long before the scheduled time
N15 0360  3    for return, Donovan would be watching for every speck
N15 0370  1    in the sky.
N15 0370  4       Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip, and
N15 0380  1    one by one the seven members of his flight fell in
N15 0380 12    behind him. The dark brown bombs hanging under each
N15 0390  6    wing looked large and powerful. The pilots' heads looked
N15 0400  4    ridiculously small. The control tower gave him immediate
N15 0410  2    take-off permission, and the clean roar of the engine
N15 0410 12    that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the
N15 0420 11    skill of Donovan.
N15 0430  1       Greg's mission was the last to leave, and as he
N15 0430 11    circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were
N15 0440  8    dropping down again. To the west, the dark green hills
N15 0450  5    of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their
N15 0460  3    slopes. Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied
N15 0460 13    gray. Water splashed against his windshield as he led
N15 0470  9    the flight in and out of showers. The metal strip they
N15 0480  8    had taken off from was coal black against the green
N15 0490  4    jungle around it. He possessed the fighter pilot's
N15 0500  1    horror of bad weather and instrument flying, and he
N15 0500 10    wondered, if the ceiling did drop, whether he and the
N15 0510  9    other flights would be able to find their way back
N15 0520  5    in this unfamiliar territory. He shivered in the warm
N15 0530  2    cockpit.
N15 0530  3       The overcast was solid above him. As far as he could
N15 0540  2    see there was no hole to climb through it. They would
N15 0540 13    have to go west through the narrow river valley that
N15 0550  9    separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't
N15 0560  6    close in before they returned.
N15 0570  1       Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle. "Todman,
N15 0570  9    let's try to go under this stuff. Stay in close and
N15 0580 10    we'll go up the valley".
N15 0590  1       "Roger, Sweeney", Todman called back, and pulled
N15 0590  8    his four in and slightly above Greg.
N15 0600  6       Greg took the formation wide around three A-26
N15 0610  5    attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf.
N15 0620  1    He dropped down to five hundred feet, swinging a little
N15 0620 11    north of the city of Tacloban, and punched into the
N15 0630  9    opening that showed against the mountain.
N15 0640  3       The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with
N15 0650  2    just about room enough for a properly performed
N15 0650 10    hundred-and-eighty-degree
N15 0660  1    turn. It was only a fifteen-minute flight, but before
N15 0660 11    it was through Greg felt himself developing a case
N15 0680  5    of claustrophobia. The ceiling stayed solid above them
N15 0690  5    at about eight hundred feet, and at times the sheer
N15 0700  3    cliffs seemed about to close in. If the other pilots
N15 0700 13    were worried, they did not show it. The formation remained
N15 0710  9    perfect.
N15 0720  1       When the sea was visible ahead of them, the relief
N15 0720 11    was as great as if the sun had come out. He spread
N15 0730  8    the flight out and led them across a point of land
N15 0740  4    and then down the coast. Although they drew light ground
N15 0750  1    fire they saw no signs of activity.
N15 0750  8       Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went
N15 0760  7    down to investigate while Greg covered him. "Somebody
N15 0770  2    beat us to it"! Todman said over the radio as he came
N15 0780  2    back up in formation.
N15 0780  6       Visibility continued to be limited, and Greg was
N15 0790  4    never able to get above a thousand feet. It was frustrating.
N15 0800  1    His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of
N15 0800 10    enemy contacts made by other flights. He thought once
N15 0810  8    that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of
N15 0820  4    Fleischman claiming a kill. But Greg's area remained
N15 0830  3    as placid as a Florida dawn.
N15 0830  9       Finally, as time began to run out, he headed into
N15 0840  8    Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence
N15 0850  3    had thought might contain Japanese supplies. The low
N15 0860  3    clouds made bombing difficult. There was not enough
N15 0860 11    room to make the usual vertical bomb run. The accuracy
N15 0870  9    was deplorable. One of Greg's bombs hung up, and he
N15 0880  8    was miles from the target before he could get rid of
N15 0890  5    it. Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and
N15 0900  1    the rest blew up jungle.
N15 0900  6       With their load of bombs gone, the planes moved
N15 0910  2    swiftly and easily. Greg went up tight against the
N15 0910 11    ceiling and led them back to their pass to home. Mercifully,
N15 0920 11    it was still open. Like a man making a deep dive, Greg
N15 0930  9    took full breath and plunged back into the valley.
N15 0940  5    He was about to make a gas check on his flight when
N15 0950  2    Todman's voice broke in: "Sweeneys! Three bogies. Twelve
N15 0960  1    o'clock level".
N15 0960  3       Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel.
N15 0970  2    He saw them, specks against the gray, but closing fast.
N15 0980  1    They were headed straight for each other on a collision
N15 0980 11    course. Friend or enemy? The same old question. And
N15 0990  8    only a few seconds to answer it.
N15 1000  2       "Zeros"! Todman said excitedly, and hopefully.
N15 1010  1       And then he thought Todman might be right. His mind
N15 1010 11    flicked through the mental pictures he had from the
N15 1020  9    hours of Aircraft Identification. He narrowed the shape
N15 1030  5    down to two: either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft.
N15 1040  5       If it were the enemy, tactically his position was
N15 1050  4    correct. Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability,
N15 1060  1    American on speed and firepower. His present maximum
N15 1060  9    altitude, up against the overcast, gave him the opportunity
N15 1070  9    to exploit his advantages. But it also made him conspicuous
N15 1080  8    to the enemy, if it was the enemy, and he hadn't been
N15 1090  7    spotted already. But the closing aircraft showed no
N15 1100  3    sign of deviating from their original course.
N15 1100 10       In seconds, Greg made his decision.
N15 1110  6       He pushed the radio button. "Sweeney Blue, hit the
N15 1120  5    deck. Lots of throttle. Todman, you take the one on
N15 1130  4    the left. I'll take the middle. Belton, the one on
N15 1130 14    the right. If ... if they're Japs. Let's make sure
N15 1140 10    first". Greg had the stick forward and the throttle
N15 1150  9    up before he heard the two "Rogers".
N15 1160  2       The planes, light with most of the gas burned out,
N15 1170  2    responded beautifully. Greg's airspeed indicator was
N15 1170  8    over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees.
N15 1180  9    The opposing aircraft continued to come on. They appeared
N15 1190  6    to be the enemy. Greg wished the Air Corps had continued
N15 1200  4    to camouflage planes. There was, of course, no way
N15 1210  2    for the other planes to get by them. It was a box.
N15 1210 14    But they could turn and escape to the east.
N15 1220  7       Greg pushed the radio button again. "Todman, drop
N15 1230  3    your second element back. If any of us miss, they can
N15 1240  2    pick up the pieces. Now let's make sure they're Japs".
N15 1250  1       Even as he said it, Greg knew they had found the
N15 1250 12    enemy. The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising
N15 1260  7    Suns were showing up, slightly brighter pinpoints in
N15 1270  4    the gray gloom.
N15 1270  7       Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned
N15 1280  6    on the guns and gun camera and gun sight. The circle
N15 1290  3    with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the
N15 1290 14    reflector glass in front of him. His hands shook. "Arm
N15 1300 10    your guns, Sweeneys".
N15 1310  1       "They're Japs. They're Japs", came a high-pitched
N15 1320  1    voice.
N15 1320  2       "Greg to Sweeney Blue. One pass only. No turns.
N15 1330  3    You'll bust your ass in this canyon. That's an order".
N15 1340  1       He moved the flights over against one wall. It gave
N15 1340 11    them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn
N15 1350 11    attack and a break-away that would not take them into
N15 1360  7    the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery. If the
N15 1370  3    turn was too tight, a barrel roll would bring them
N15 1370 13    out. A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll, but it
N15 1380 12    could be done.
N15 1390  1       Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed
N15 1390 11    up the RPM, and the engine responded as if it had
N15 1400  9    been waiting. The clearly identifiable enemy continued
N15 1410  4    on as if no one else were around. "They haven't seen
N15 1420  3    us", Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise.
N15 1430  1    "They haven't seen us". He hit the radio button. "Now,
N15 1430 11    Sweeneys, now. Let's take 'em home".
N15 1440  6       He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks
N15 1450  6    sag. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched his wingman
N15 1460  3    move out a bit and shoot up with him. Perfect, he thought.
N15 1470  1       With the rapid rate of closure, the approach from
N15 1470 10    below, the side, and ahead, there would be only a moment
N15 1480 11    when damage could be done. Just like shooting at a
N15 1490  8    duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board.
N15 1500  5       He tightened his turn. His nose up. It was going
N15 1510  3    to be dangerous. Eight aircraft in this small box.
N15 1510 12    Please, dear God, make my pilots good, he prayed.
N15 1520  9       He took a lead on the enemy, using a distance of
N15 1530  7    five of the radii in his circular sight and then added
N15 1540  4    another. The enemy did not veer. It did not seem possible
N15 1550  1    that they hadn't been spotted. Blind fools.
N15 1550  8       Now!
N15 1560  1       Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger. The
N15 1560  9    plane rumbled and slowed. Six red lines etched their
N15 1570  8    way into the gray and vanished. As if drawn by a wire
N15 1580  7    the enemy flew into them. Greg tightened his turn until
N15 1590  3    the plane shuddered. Luck was with him. His burst held
N15 1600  1    for a second on the engine section of the plane. The
N15 1600 12    Jap's propeller flew off in pieces. A large piece of
N15 1610  9    engine cowling vanished. It was all Greg had time to
N15 1620  7    see. His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near
N15 1630  3    the overcast, almost inverted and heading up into the
N15 1630 12    clouds. His speed was dropping rapidly. If he spun
N15 1640  9    out now, he would join his opponent on the ground.
N15 1650  6       Wingman, stay clear, he prayed. He pushed stick
N15 1660  3    and rudder and entered the overcast on his back. He
N15 1660 13    fought the panic of vertigo. He had no idea which was
N15 1670 11    up and which was down. He held the controls where they
N15 1680  8    had been. Sweat popped out over him and he felt the
N15 1690  6    slick between his palm and the stick grip. His air
N15 1700  2    speed dropped until he thought he would spin out.
