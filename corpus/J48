J48 0010  1       THE SUMMARY REPORT ON DESEGREGATION PROGRESS IN
J48 0010  8    EDUCATION IN THE MIDDLE-SOUTH REGION, 1959-1960" clearly
J48 0020  8    shows two pieces of information. The Summary Report,
J48 0030  5    which was prepared for this Conference, indicates,
J48 0040  2    first, that actual or pending school desegregation
J48 0040  9    is increasing; second, that both actual and pending
J48 0050  8    desegregation is, with few exceptions, the product
J48 0060  6    or result of court order. The Report together with
J48 0070  3    other information suggests that desegregation in the
J48 0080  1    schools is slow.
J48 0080  4       The Middle-South Region, as defined by the National
J48 0090  2    Association of Intergroup Relations Officials (NAIRO),
J48 0100  1    consists of the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee,
J48 0100  9    West Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the District
J48 0110  7    of Columbia. The states and the Nation's Capital all
J48 0120  7    have some desegregation, in fact some dating back to
J48 0130  6    1954; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest
J48 0140  3    opposition. Desegregation has been opposed by massive
J48 0150  1    resistance, interposition, pupil assignment (with no
J48 0150  7    assignments of Negro children), and hate bombings.
J48 0160  6    #DESEGREGATION AND COURT ORDER#
J48 0170  1    Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase
J48 0170 11    in desegregation and such increase as a result of court
J48 0180  9    order. First Kentucky. Elementary school desegregation
J48 0190  4    came to Owen and Union Counties, which already had
J48 0200  4    high school desegregation. The action was a result
J48 0210  1    of a court order, the citation for which (and for other
J48 0210 12    court action mentioned in this paper) is taken from
J48 0220  8    the Summary Report for this Conference. In Maryland
J48 0230  4    the Harford County Board of Education had prepared
J48 0240  3    a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which
J48 0250  2    a plaintiff had challenged; thus, county school board
J48 0250 10    and Federal court joined hands here to promote school
J48 0260  8    desegregation.
J48 0270  1       Additional school desegregation in Tennessee resulted
J48 0270  6    from a court order opening a school serving children
J48 0280  7    of military personnel. Similarly, further desegregation
J48 0290  3    may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities,
J48 0300  2    Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis. In West Virginia
J48 0310  1    the number of white and Negro children attending the
J48 0310 10    same school has increased almost twofold. There are
J48 0320  7    no court decisions here.
J48 0330  1       As in Maryland, a District court has approved an
J48 0330 10    official plan of school desegregation in Delaware.
J48 0340  6    As a result of the State Board of Education plan, Negro
J48 0350  6    children entered heretofore white elementary schools
J48 0360  3    in five districts. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals
J48 0370  2    is reviewing an appeal from the plan.
J48 0370  9       In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in
J48 0380  7    Charlottesville and Floyd Counties. Desegregation in
J48 0390  3    Pulaski County is pending because of court order, although
J48 0400  3    date of admission is not yet determined. Negro parents
J48 0410  1    have filed application for admission of additional
J48 0410  8    children to schools in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax,
J48 0420  5    and Warren Counties. Desegregation can also result
J48 0430  4    from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against
J48 0440  2    school boards in Newport News, Fairfax County, Arlington
J48 0450  1    County, and Norfolk.
J48 0450  4       As a school district, the District of Columbia has
J48 0460  4    had desegregated schools since 1954, shortly after
J48 0470  2    the Supreme Court decision.
J48 0470  6       This recapitulation makes it clear that school desegregation
J48 0480  6    continues, including the Old Dominion State, in spite
J48 0490  4    of its stern resistance. The record is clear that increase
J48 0500  2    in school desegregation last year came largely as a
J48 0500 11    result of a court order; that on the immediate horizon,
J48 0510 10    if further large-scale (relatively speaking) desegregation
J48 0520  4    comes, it will result from court orders on suits filed
J48 0530  5    in several Middle-South states. Knowledge that thousands
J48 0540  3    of school districts are involved and observation that
J48 0550  1    school desegregation has occurred in only a handful
J48 0550  9    in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that
J48 0560  5    desegregation-from-court-order
J48 0560  9    is slow.
J48 0570  1       Before turning to my views as to the problems and
J48 0570 11    issues before us at this Regional Conference, I wish
J48 0580  6    to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers
J48 0590  5    to the District of Columbia. That reference in the
J48 0600  3    Report is "continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro
J48 0610  1    school system", a remark apparently occasioned by the
J48 0610  9    increase of Negro school population from 74.1 per cent
J48 0620  7    to 76.7 per cent. I see no real prospects for an all-Negro
J48 0630  7    school population. West of Rock Creek Park is still
J48 0640  4    monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white
J48 0650  1    as a result of Georgetown's conversion-by-renovation
J48 0650  9    housing program. Nearby Foggy Bottom is ousting Negroes.
J48 0660  7    The large acreage in the Southwest Redevelopment area
J48 0670  6    beckons white people- what with high-priced town houses
J48 0680  5    and elevator apartments. The Capitol Hill rehabilitation,
J48 0690  2    like Foggy Bottom, replaces Negroes with whites (but
J48 0700  1    also replaces some whites with other whites).
J48 0700  8       The sharpest break with tradition, the past and
J48 0710  7    present of "White Ring Around a Black Core", may come
J48 0720  6    with the opening of nearby Montgomery County suburbs
J48 0730  2    to Negro residents and, presumably, the consequent
J48 0730  9    conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the
J48 0740  9    Negro by fleeing to the suburbs. In fact, short of
J48 0750  7    fleeing to Warrenton, Virginia, or Rockville, Maryland,
J48 0760  2    white people may have to live with Negroes. All of
J48 0770  2    this must be taken into account before the image of
J48 0770 12    an "all-Negro" D.C. public school system is conjured
J48 0780  7    up.
J48 0780  8    #PROBLEMS TO SOLVE#
J48 0790  2    From the Summary Report before us at this Conference,
J48 0790 11    a number of problems are apparent. They vex us and
J48 0800  9    perplex us but generally do not divide us like the
J48 0810  7    issues which follow the problems.
J48 0820  1       First, how can we step up the desegregation movement?
J48 0820  9    It is slow. I believe we all want more schools where
J48 0830  9    white and Negro together can and do attend. I believe
J48 0840  7    we all want no child denied admission to a school on
J48 0850  4    account of his color. In general, members of NAIRO
J48 0860  1    would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest
J48 0860 11    his residence or within his residence zone. How to
J48 0870  8    achieve this objective is a problem, but we are not
J48 0880  7    divided on what we want.
J48 0880 12       Second, as we increase the number of desegregated
J48 0890  7    school districts and schools themselves, how can we
J48 0900  4    achieve this action through school board action? It
J48 0910  2    may be county school board or state school board action,
J48 0910 12    as well as that of municipal school boards. Correlatively,
J48 0920  8    can we reduce the role of the district courts, so that
J48 0930  8    the action is that of the people of the community or
J48 0940  5    other school district and not that of the law court?
J48 0950  1    This is a problem, and I believe there is little difference
J48 0950 12    of opinion that wherever possible a local school board
J48 0960  9    should devise and effect a plan of desegregation.
J48 0970  6       Third, how can we insure a systematic and continuing
J48 0980  3    group relations education in the schools? Not simply
J48 0990  2    a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated
J48 0990 11    but a continuing program that also promotes integration,
J48 1000  8    that encourages the children and teachers not to look
J48 1010  8    at each other as white or Negro, but as human beings.
J48 1020  5    Again the problem is how to get it done and in what
J48 1030  3    form to offer the group relations education; not whether
J48 1030 12    it should be done.
J48 1040  4       Fourth, in the segregated school system, during
J48 1050  1    the period before desegregation, how can we assure
J48 1050  9    equal opportunity? In fact, in the desegregated school
J48 1060  7    system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro
J48 1070  6    population, how can we assure equal opportunity? This
J48 1080  2    is a problem, but we are not divided over its importance
J48 1090  1    or by its existence.
J48 1090  5       Fifth, in the segregated school system or in the
J48 1100  4    all-Negro or all-white schools, how can we encourage
J48 1100 14    better group relations or an improved attitude toward
J48 1110  8    people who do not belong to the group? Can we help
J48 1120  7    children adjust to "images of other children" when
J48 1130  3    the latter are not actually present.
J48 1130  9    #NOW, THE ISSUES#
J48 1140  1    If we have five problems whose solution we seek in
J48 1140 11    relatively united fashion, then there are twice as
J48 1150  8    many issues which, I judge, sharply divide us, intergroup
J48 1160  4    relations practitioners and lay people.
J48 1170  1    _ISSUE NO. 1. PUPIL ASSIGNMENT._
J48 1170  5       Since on the one hand school desegregation has come
J48 1190  3    in Virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment, shall
J48 1200  1    we support the plan? On the basis of pupil assignment
J48 1200 11    criteria, Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children
J48 1210  8    to formerly white schools in Arlington and Alexandria,
J48 1220  6    Virginia. Shall we support pupil assignment? On the
J48 1230  4    other hand, looking at the larger picture, is it true
J48 1240  4    that pupil assignment has effectively cut off, blocked,
J48 1240 12    or reduced school desegregation to a "trickle"? Shall
J48 1250  8    we therefore oppose the plan? This question is an issue
J48 1260  9    because it likely divides us into two camps- those
J48 1270  6    for or against pupil assignment.
J48 1290  1    _ISSUE NO. 2. TEACHER ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER TO DESEGREGATE._
J48 1290  7       In large cities like Baltimore, Louisville, and
J48 1300  5    Washington, D.C., should school desegregation be extended
J48 1310  4    to all-Negro and all-white schools by assigning white
J48 1320  3    and Negro teachers, respectively? On the one hand do
J48 1330  2    we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that
J48 1330 11    a child not be denied admission to a school on account
J48 1340 10    of his race? Or should we argue that if we want adjustment
J48 1350  8    of children to children of different races and that
J48 1360  4    that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other
J48 1370  1    school, we must at least provide him some opportunity
J48 1370 10    to adjust to people of another race within the school
J48 1380  9    namely, to a teacher of another race. We can argue
J48 1390  5    that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible
J48 1400  2    teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated
J48 1410  1    situation.
J48 1420  1    _ISSUE NO. 3. THE PLAINTIFF IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION
J48 1430  1    CASES._
J48 1430  1       The earlier part of my statement deals with the
J48 1430 10    court orders that resulted in desegregation. In each
J48 1440  6    instance the plaintiff was a private citizen. In thousands
J48 1450  4    of school districts, indeed, in the entire State of
J48 1460  3    Mississippi, no plaintiff has come forth. And I have
J48 1460 12    established that the action of municipal, county, or
J48 1470  8    state school boards or boards of education is small,
J48 1480  7    infinitesimally small in comparison with the number
J48 1490  4    of districts. Is the requirement that the plaintiff
J48 1490 12    be a person actually denied admission to a school a
J48 1500 10    sound requirement? Should Congress authorize the Attorney
J48 1510  6    General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child
J48 1520  5    to a school to which he is denied entrance? Even though
J48 1530  3    in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision
J48 1540  1    for the Attorney General to act was eliminated, should
J48 1540 10    we nevertheless support such a clause? This is an issue,
J48 1560  9    for it divides people rather sharply.
J48 1590  1    _ISSUE NO. 4. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS TO SCHOOLS THAT
J48 1590  2    DENY CHILDREN ON ACCOUNT OF RACE._
J48 1590  8       This is the Powell Amendment, which in 1957 divided
J48 1600  5    even a "liberal" group like the American Veterans Committee
J48 1610  3    (AVC). Should we support a clause in Federal school
J48 1620  2    construction or school assistance legislation that
J48 1620  8    would deny Federal funds to a school district that
J48 1630  9    denies admission to a child on account of his race?
J48 1640  7    This is softer than earlier Powell amendments which
J48 1650  2    would have denied funds to all segregated school districts.
J48 1660  1    There is nonetheless considerable argument against
J48 1660  7    the clause, softened though it be, on the grounds that
J48 1670  9    Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools.
J48 1680  5    The Federal funds limitation enlists the support of
J48 1690  2    many, the opposition of quite a few.
J48 1710  1    _ISSUE NO. 5. REQUIRED PUBLIC EDUCATION._
J48 1710  3       Should a political subdivision, state or county
J48 1720  1    or municipality, be required to furnish public education?
J48 1720  9    For the school year, 1959-1960, the Prince Edward County
J48 1730  9    (Virginia) Board of Supervisors voted not to provide
J48 1740  7    funds for public education, and the school board therefore
J48 1750  5    could provide no public education- for white or Negro
J48 1760  3    children. Is public education in this American democracy
J48 1770  1    of such importance that no child should be denied public
J48 1770 11    education? Or is this subject a matter of self-determination,
J48 1780 10    a matter of states rights or county rights? If people
J48 1790  7    don't want to provide public education, should they
J48 1800  4    be forced to do so? Even if we marshal substantial
J48 1810  1    agreement behind mandatory public education, we likely
J48 1810  8    cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation.
J48 1820 10    Should the requirement, which must therefore be Federal
J48 1830  7    in nature, be legislated by the United States Congress?
J48 1840  6    Or must it become law by amendment of the United States
J48 1850  5    Constitution? We actually have two issues in this question-
J48 1860  4    goal and method.
J48 1880  1    _ISSUE NO. 6. FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATION
J48 1880  3    OF THE CITIZENS._
J48 1880  6       If the above issue is settled by requiring public
J48 1890  4    education for all citizens, Issue No. 6 may be moot.
J48 1900  3    If, on the other hand, it is not settled, or while
J48 1900 14    it is being debated and resolved, does the Federal
J48 1910  7    government have a responsibility in situations like
J48 1920  4    that in Prince Edward County? Nearly half the children
J48 1930  4    still receive no education. Must or should the Federal
J48 1940  1    government help? Should the government directly provide
J48 1940  8    education for the children who want public education?
