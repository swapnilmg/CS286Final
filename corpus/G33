G33 0010  1    More likely, you simply told yourself, as you handed
G33 0010 10    us the book, that it mattered little what we incanted
G33 0020  7    providing we underwent the discipline of incantation.
G33 0030  3       For pride's sake, I will not say that the coy and
G33 0040  4    leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself
G33 0040 12    into my soul. Besides, that particular message does
G33 0050  8    no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood.
G33 0060  7    But what you could not know, of course, was how smoothly
G33 0070  4    the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American
G33 0080  1    Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we
G33 0080 10    adolescents were to come, if not of age, then into
G33 0090 10    a bright, taut semblance of it. I do not suppose you
G33 0100  6    ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald, living or dead,
G33 0110  3    and moreover I do not suppose that, even if you had,
G33 0110 14    his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more
G33 0120  9    than a cluck of disapproval. Neither his appetites,
G33 0130  4    his exacerbations, nor his despair were kin to yours.
G33 0140  4    He might have been the man in the moon for all you
G33 0140 16    could have understood him. But he was no man in the
G33 0150 11    moon to me. Although his tender nights were not the
G33 0160  7    ones I dreamed of, nor was it for yachts, sports cars,
G33 0170  3    tall drinks, and swimming pools, nor yet for money
G33 0170 12    or what money buys that I burned, I too was burning
G33 0180 11    and watching myself burn. The flame was simply of a
G33 0190  8    different kind. It was symbolized (at least for those
G33 0200  5    of us who recognized ourselves in the image) by that
G33 0210  1    self-consuming, elegiac candle of Edna St. Vincent
G33 0210  9    Millay's, that candle which from the quatrain where
G33 0220  8    she ensconced it became a beacon to us, but which in
G33 0230  7    point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral
G33 0240  4    taper to last even the evening, let alone the night.
G33 0240 14    One should not, of course, pluck the head off a flower
G33 0250 11    and expect its perfume to linger on. Yet this passion
G33 0260  7    for passion, now that I look back on it with passion
G33 0270  5    spent, seems somewhat overblown and operatic, though
G33 0280  1    as a diva Miss Millay perfectly controlled her notes.
G33 0280 10    Only what else was she singing but the old Song of
G33 0290 10    Songs, that most ancient of tunes that nature plays
G33 0300  6    with such unfailing response upon young nerves? Perhaps
G33 0310  2    this is not so little. Perhaps the mere fact that by
G33 0320  1    plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most
G33 0320 11    ordinary of us, temporarily anyway, the sleeping poet,
G33 0330  5    and in poets can discover their immortality, is the
G33 0340  4    most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to
G33 0350  1    which we can attest? One can see it as humiliating
G33 0350 11    that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry
G33 0360  6    may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or
G33 0370  5    a friend; one can take it as no more than another veil
G33 0380  2    torn from the mystery of the soul. But it could also
G33 0380 13    be looked at from the other end of the spectrum. One
G33 0390 10    could see this chemical determinant as in itself a
G33 0400  5    miracle. In any case, Miss Millay's sweet-throated
G33 0410  1    bitterness, her variations on the theme that the world
G33 0410 10    was not only well lost for love but even well lost
G33 0420 11    for lost love, her constant and wonderfully tragic
G33 0430  4    posture, so unlike that of Fitzgerald since it required
G33 0440  3    no scenery or props, drew from the me that I was when
G33 0450  1    I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.
G33 0450  9       But all this, I am well aware, is the bel canto
G33 0460  8    of love, and although I have always liked to think
G33 0470  4    that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that
G33 0480  2    I listened, I know well enough that it was not. If
G33 0480 13    I am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of
G33 0490  8    love, I will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant
G33 0500  6    nightingale. There is another side of love, more nearly
G33 0510  5    symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie,
G33 0520  1    or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug.
G33 0520 12       Whether you experienced the passion of desire I
G33 0530  8    have, of course, no way of knowing, nor indeed have
G33 0540  6    I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a
G33 0550  3    wish to know, for the fact that one constitutes by
G33 0550 13    one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some
G33 0560 10    sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part
G33 0570  5    of one's parents' experience more immodest, more scandalizing,
G33 0580  3    more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger.
G33 0590  3    I recoil from the very thought. At the same time, I
G33 0590 14    am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers
G33 0600 10    of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an
G33 0610  9    incestuous sign, since theirs is a science of paradox:
G33 0620  3    if one hates, they say it is because one loves; if
G33 0630  2    one bullies, they say it is because one is afraid;
G33 0630 12    if one shuns, they say it is because one desires; and
G33 0640  9    according to them, whatever one fancies one feels,
G33 0650  5    what one feels in fact is the opposite. Well, normally
G33 0660  2    abnormal or normally normal, neurotic or merely fastidious
G33 0660 10    (do the tea-leaf readers, by the way, allow psyches
G33 0670 10    to have moral taste?), I have never wanted to know
G33 0680  7    what you knew of passion.
G33 0680 12    ##
G33 0680 13    YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT REMEMBER, SINCE YOU NEVER seemed
G33 0690  9    to remember even the same moments as I, much less their
G33 0710  9    intensity, one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you
G33 0720  5    had set out with me for some final shopping less than
G33 0730  3    a week before the wedding you staged for me with such
G33 0730 14    reluctance at the Farm. I can see us now. We had been
G33 0740 12    walking quite briskly, for despite your being so small
G33 0750  7    and me so tall, your stride in those days could easily
G33 0760  4    match mine. We had stopped before a shop window to
G33 0770  2    assess its autumnal display, when you suddenly turned
G33 0770 10    to me, looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats,
G33 0780  9    and with your nervous "ahem"! said: "There are things
G33 0790  5    I must tell you about this man you are marrying which
G33 0800  4    he does not know himself". If you had screamed right
G33 0810  2    there in the street where we stood, I could not have
G33 0810 13    felt more fear. With scarcely a mumble of excuse, I
G33 0820  9    fled. I fled, however, not from what might have been
G33 0830  7    the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you
G33 0840  3    that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you
G33 0850  1    meant the word "things"- which you had been galvanizing
G33 0850 10    yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal
G33 0860 11    duty were things which I had already insisted upon
G33 0870  6    finding out for myself (despite, I may now say, the
G33 0880  3    unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on
G33 0880 10    principle, yes, on principle, and in cold blood) because
G33 0890  9    I was resolved, as a modern woman, not to be a mollycoddle
G33 0900  9    waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat. I
G33 0910  6    had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of
G33 0920  2    self-betrayal. What I fled from was my fear of what,
G33 0920 13    unwittingly, you might betray, without meaning to,
G33 0930  7    about my father and yourself.
G33 0940  1       But I can see from this latest trick of memory how
G33 0940 12    much more arbitrary and influential it is than the
G33 0950  9    will. While my memory holds with relentless tenacity,
G33 0960  5    as I cannot too often stress, to my wrongs, when it
G33 0970  3    comes to my shames, it gestures and jokes and toys
G33 0970 13    with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope
G33 0980  8    of distracting me from them. Just as I was about to
G33 0990  8    enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf
G33 1000  4    of love, memory, displeased at being asked to yield
G33 1000 13    its unsavory secrets, dashed ahead of me, calling back
G33 1010  9    over its shoulder: "Skip it. Cut it out". But I will
G33 1020  9    not skip it or cut it out. It is not my intention in
G33 1040  7    this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim
G33 1050  2    moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings
G33 1060  1    of chance. If to be innocent is to be helpless, then
G33 1060 12    I had been- as are we all- helpless at the start. But
G33 1070 12    the time came when I was no longer innocent and therefore
G33 1080  6    no longer helpless. Helpless in that sense I can never
G33 1090  5    be again. However, I confess my hope that I will be
G33 1100  3    innocent again, not with a pristine, accidental innocence,
G33 1100 11    but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting
G33 1110 10    away of the flesh to reach the bone.
G33 1120  5       For innocence, of all the graces of the spirit,
G33 1130  2    is I believe the one most to be prayed for. Although
G33 1130 13    it is constantly made to look foolish (too simple to
G33 1140  8    come in out of the rain, people say, who have found
G33 1150  6    in the innocent an impediment), it does not mind looking
G33 1160  3    foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks.
G33 1170  1    It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem
G33 1170 12    best, and when they seem worst it overlooks them. To
G33 1180  8    innocence, a word given is a word that will be kept.
G33 1190  5    Instinctively, innocence does unto others as it expects
G33 1200  2    to be done by. But when these expectations are once
G33 1200 12    too often ground into the dust, innocence can falter,
G33 1210  8    since its strength is according to the strength of
G33 1220  5    him who possesses it. The innocence of which I speak
G33 1230  3    is, I know, not incorruptible. But I insist upon believing
G33 1240  1    that even when it is lost, it may, like paradise, be
G33 1240 12    regained.
G33 1250  1       However, it was not of innocence in general that
G33 1250 10    I was speaking, but of perhaps the frailest and surely
G33 1260  8    the least important side of it which is innocence in
G33 1270  6    romantic love. Here, if anywhere, it is not wholly
G33 1280  2    incontrovertible. To you, for instance, the word innocence,
G33 1280 10    in this connotation, probably retained its Biblical,
G33 1290  7    or should I say technical sense, and therefore I suppose
G33 1300  7    I must make myself quite clear by saying that I lost-
G33 1310  6    or rather handed over- what you would have considered
G33 1320  3    to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled,
G33 1330  1    and in fact by oath required, to hand it over along
G33 1330 12    with what other goods and bads I had. But to me innocence
G33 1340 10    is far less tangible. I had long since begun to lose
G33 1350  8    my general innocence when I lost my trust in you, but
G33 1360  5    this special innocence I lost before ever I loved,
G33 1370  1    through my discovery that one could tremble with desire
G33 1370 10    and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing,
G33 1380  7    nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking, let
G33 1390  5    alone with love. I knew this knowledge to be corrupting
G33 1400  3    at the time I acquired it; today, these many years
G33 1400 13    later, after all the temptations resisted or yielded
G33 1410  8    to, the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions
G33 1420  5    since endured, I call it corrupting still.
G33 1430  3       You, I could swear to it, remained innocent in this
G33 1440  3    sense until the end. Yours, but not mine, was an age
G33 1440 14    in which innocence was fostered and carefully- if not
G33 1450  8    perhaps altogether innocently- preserved. You had grown
G33 1460  5    up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a
G33 1470  4    lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her
G33 1480  2    face. Moreover, because of the particular blot on your
G33 1480 11    family escutcheon through what may only have been one
G33 1490  9    unbridled moment on your grandmother's part, and because
G33 1500  5    you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your
G33 1510  4    childhood to outgrow, what you obviously most desired
G33 1520  1    with both your conscious and unconscious person, what
G33 1520  9    you bent your whole will, sensibility, and intelligence
G33 1530  6    upon, was to be a lady. Before being daughter, wife,
G33 1540  4    or mother, before being cultured (a word now bereft
G33 1550  2    both socially and politically of the sheen you children
G33 1550 11    of frontiersmen bestowed on it), before being sorry
G33 1560  7    for the poor, progressive about public health, and
G33 1570  5    prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian, indeed
G33 1580  2    first and foremost, you were a lady. There was, of
G33 1580 12    course, more to the portrait of a lady you carried
G33 1590 10    in your mind's eye than the sine qua non of her virtue.
G33 1600  8    A lady, you made clear to me both by precept and example,
G33 1610  5    never raised her voice or slumped in her chair, never
G33 1620  2    failed in social tact (in heaven, for instance, would
G33 1620 11    not mention St. John the Baptist's head), never pouted
G33 1630  8    or withdrew or scandalized in company, never reminded
G33 1640  6    others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or
G33 1650  5    gesture, never indulged in public scenes or private
G33 1660  1    confidences, never spoke of money save in terms of
G33 1660 10    alleviating suffering, never gossiped or maligned,
G33 1670  5    never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness
G33 1680  3    of anything from sin to death itself.
