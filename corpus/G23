G23 0010  1       DURING the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration,
G23 0020  1    a red scare developed in our country. Many Americans
G23 0020 10    reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and
G23 0030  7    turned to the repression of ideas by force. Postmaster
G23 0040  5    General Burleson set about to protect the American
G23 0050  2    people against radical propaganda that might be spread
G23 0050 10    through the mails. Attorney General Palmer made a series
G23 0060  9    of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals
G23 0070  8    to the jails, in direct violation of their constitutional
G23 0080  4    rights. Then, not many years later, the Un-American
G23 0090  3    Activities Committee, under the leadership of Martin
G23 0100  1    Dies, pilloried hundreds of decent, patriotic citizens.
G23 0100  8    Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring
G23 0110  9    defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a
G23 0120  5    traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction
G23 0130  1    of our government. This hysteria reached its height
G23 0130  9    under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Demagogues
G23 0140  7    of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind
G23 0150  5    any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped
G23 0160  3    notions. New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed,
G23 0170  1    no matter how.
G23 0170  4       Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts, credit
G23 0180  2    ideas with high potency. They give strict interpretation
G23 0180 10    to William James' statement that "Every idea that enters
G23 0190  9    the mind tends to express itself". They seem to believe
G23 0200  9    that a person will act automatically as soon as he
G23 0210  7    contacts something new. Hence, the only defensible
G23 0220  2    procedure is to repress any and every notion, unless
G23 0220 11    it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.
G23 0230  8       Despite this danger, however, we are informed on
G23 0240  6    every hand that ideas, not machines, are our finest
G23 0250  3    tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be
G23 0250 12    recorded on a ledger page; they are the most valuable
G23 0260 10    of commodities- and the most salable, for their demand
G23 0270  8    far exceeds supply. So all-important are ideas, we
G23 0280  4    are told, that persons successful in business and happy
G23 0290  2    in social life usually fall into two classes: those
G23 0290 11    who invent new ideas of their own, and those who borrow,
G23 0300 10    beg, or steal from others.
G23 0310  1       Seemingly, with an unrestricted flow of ideas, all
G23 0310  9    will be well, and we are even assured that "an idea
G23 0320 11    a day will keep the sheriff away". That, however, may
G23 0330  5    also bring the police, if the thinking does not meet
G23 0340  4    with social approval. Criminals, as well as model citizens,
G23 0350  2    exercise their minds. Merely having a mental image
G23 0350 10    of some sort is not the all-important consideration.
G23 0360  8       Of course, there must be clarity: a single distinct
G23 0370  7    impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones. But
G23 0380  5    clarity is not enough. The writer took a class of college
G23 0390  3    students to the state hospital for the mentally ill
G23 0390 12    in St. Joseph, Missouri. An inmate, a former university
G23 0400  8    professor, expounded to us, logically and clearly,
G23 0410  6    that someone was pilfering his thoughts. He appealed
G23 0420  3    to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities
G23 0430  1    that justice might be done. Despite the clarity of
G23 0430 10    his presentation, his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre.
G23 0440  8       True, ideas are important, perhaps life's most precious
G23 0450  7    treasures. But have we not gone overboard in stressing
G23 0460  6    their significance? Have we not actually developed
G23 0470  2    idea worship?
G23 0470  4       Ideas we must have, and we seek them everywhere.
G23 0480  3    We scour literature for them; here we find stored the
G23 0490  2    wisdom of great minds. But are all these works worthy
G23 0490 12    of consideration? Can they stand rigid scrutiny?
G23 0500  6       Shakespeare's wit and wisdom, his profound insight
G23 0510  7    into human nature, have stood the test of centuries.
G23 0520  4    But was he infallible in all things? What of his treatment
G23 0530  3    of the Jew in The Merchant of Venice?
G23 0535  1       Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock,
G23 0540  8    but probably he never saw a Jew, unless in some of
G23 0550  6    his travels. The Jews had been banished from England
G23 0560  2    in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655,
G23 0560 12    when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years.
G23 0570  9    If any had escaped expulsion by hiding, they certainly
G23 0580  6    would not frequent the market-place.
G23 0590  1       Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents
G23 0590  8    in his plays, but borrowed them from old stories, ballads,
G23 0600  8    and plays, wove them together, and then breathed into
G23 0610  6    them his spark of life. Rather than from a first-hand
G23 0620  5    study of Jewish people, his delineation of Shylock
G23 0630  1    stems from a collection of Italian stories, Il Pecorone,
G23 0630 10    published in 1558, although written almost two centuries
G23 0650  6    earlier. He could learn at second hand from books,
G23 0660  7    but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit.
G23 0670  3    Harris J. Griston, in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare
G23 0680  2    (216), writes: "There is not a word spoken by Shylock
G23 0690  1    which one would expect from a real Jew".
G23 0690  9       He took the story of the pound of flesh and had
G23 0700  9    to fasten it on someone. The Jew was the safest victim.
G23 0710  5    No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling
G23 0720  2    theater. It would have been unwise policy, for instance,
G23 0730  1    to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the
G23 0730 10    thrifty Scotchman. Just as now anyone may hurl insults
G23 0740  8    at a citizen of Mars, or even of Tikopia, and no senatorial
G23 0750  6    investigation will result. Who cares about them!
G23 0760  3       Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an
G23 0770  1    aberrant individual. He sets him forth as being typical
G23 0770 10    of the group. He tells of his "Jewish heart"- not a
G23 0780  9    Shylockian heart; but a Jewish heart. This would make
G23 0790  8    anyone crafty and cruel, capable of fiendish revenge.
G23 0800  4       There is no justification for such misrepresentation.
G23 0810  1    If living Jews were unavailable for study, the Bible
G23 0820  1    was at hand. Reading the Old Testament would have shown
G23 0820 11    the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock
G23 0830  7    were abhorrent to the Jews.
G23 0840  1       Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea
G23 0840  9    of Shylock? Studying The Merchant of Venice in high
G23 0850  8    school and college has given many young people their
G23 0860  7    notions about Jews. Does this help the non-Jew to understand
G23 0870  6    this group?
G23 0870  8       Thomas de Torquemada, Inquisitor-General of the
G23 0880  5    Spanish Inquisition, put many persons to death. His
G23 0890  4    name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty. Would
G23 0900  1    we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching
G23 0900 10    today's Roman Catholics by saying he had a Catholic
G23 0910  8    heart? Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth
G23 0920  7    century where they belong; he is out of place in our
G23 0930  6    times. Shakespeare's Shylock, too, is of dubious value
G23 0940  2    in the modern world.
G23 0940  6       Ideas, in and of themselves, are not necessarily
G23 0950  3    the greatest good. A successful businessman recently
G23 0960  1    prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement
G23 0960 11    that all economists should be sent to the hospitals
G23 0970  8    for the mentally deranged where they and their theories
G23 0980  5    might rot together. Will his words come to be treasured
G23 0990  4    and quoted through the years?
G23 0990  9       Frequently we are given assurance that automatically
G23 1000  6    all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end
G23 1010  5    only the good ones will survive. But is that not like
G23 1020  2    going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring
G23 1020 10    out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and
G23 1030  9    then, after stirring, expecting a new wonder drug inevitably
G23 1040  6    to result?
G23 1040  8       What of the efficiency of this natural instrument
G23 1050  5    of free discussion? Is there some magic in it that
G23 1060  5    assures results?
G23 1060  7       When Peter B. Kyne (Pride of Palomar, 43) informed
G23 1070  6    us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the
G23 1080  4    Japanese, did the heated debates of the Californians
G23 1090  1    settle the truth or falsity of the proposition?
G23 1100  1       The Leopard's Spots came from the pen of Thomas
G23 1100  9    Dixon in 1902, and in this he announced an "unchangeable"
G23 1110  8    law. If a child had a single drop of Negro blood, he
G23 1120  8    would revert to the ancestral line which, except as
G23 1130  3    slaves under a superior race, had not made one step
G23 1130 13    of progress in 3,000 years. That doctrine has been
G23 1140  9    accepted by many, but has it produced good results?
G23 1150  6       In the same vein, a certain short-story plot has
G23 1160  5    been overworked. The son and heir of a prominent family
G23 1170  2    marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons
G23 1170 14    of her finger nails. In time she presents her aristocratic
G23 1180 10    husband with a coal-black child. Is the world better
G23 1190  9    for having this idea thrust upon it? Will argument
G23 1200  4    and debate decide its truth or falsity?
G23 1210  1       For answers to such questions we must turn to the
G23 1210 11    anthropologists, the biologists, the historians, the
G23 1220  6    psychologists, and the sociologists. Long ago they
G23 1230  4    consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap
G23 1240  1    heap.
G23 1240  2       False ideas surfeit another sector of our life.
G23 1240 10    For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing
G23 1250  8    with the steprelationship. The stepmother, almost without
G23 1260  5    exception, has been presented as a cruel ogress. Children,
G23 1270  6    conditioned by this mistaken notion, have feared stepmothers,
G23 1280  4    while adults, by their antagonistic attitudes, have
G23 1290  2    made the role of the substitute parents a difficult
G23 1290 11    one. Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and
G23 1300  9    make the lot of the stepchild a happier one. Research,
G23 1310  5    on the other hand, has shown many stepmothers to be
G23 1320  3    eminently successful, some far better than the real
G23 1320 11    mothers.
G23 1330  1       Helen Deutsch informed us (The Psychology of Women,
G23 1340  1    Vol. II, 434) that in all cultures "the term 'stepmother'
G23 1350  1    automatically evokes deprecatory implications", a conclusion
G23 1350  7    accepted by many. Will mere debate on that proposition,
G23 1360  9    even though it be free and untrammeled, remove the
G23 1370  6    dross and leave a residue of refined gold? That is
G23 1380  4    questionable, to say the least. Research into several
G23 1390  1    cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one.
G23 1390 11       Most assuredly ideas are invaluable. But ideas,
G23 1400  7    just for the sake of having them, are not enough. In
G23 1410  6    the 1930's, cures for the depression literally flooded
G23 1420  2    Washington. For a time the President received hundreds
G23 1430  1    of them every day, most of them worthless.
G23 1430  9       Ideas need to be tested, and not merely by argument
G23 1440  7    and debate. When some question arises in the medical
G23 1450  4    field concerning cancer, for instance, we do not turn
G23 1460  2    to free and open discussion as in a political campaign.
G23 1460 12    We have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist
G23 1470  7    in the laboratory. The merits of the Salk anti-polio
G23 1480  7    vaccine were not established on the forensic platform
G23 1490  3    or in newspaper editorials, but in the laboratory and
G23 1500  2    by tests in the field on thousands of children.
G23 1500 11       Our presidential campaigns provide much debate and
G23 1510  6    argument. But is the result new barnsful of tested
G23 1520  5    knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence
G23 1530  1    solve our domestic and international problems? Man,
G23 1530  8    we are told, is endowed with reason and is capable
G23 1540  9    of distinguishing good from bad. But what a super-Herculean
G23 1550  7    task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered
G23 1560  5    arguments used so freely, particularly since such common
G23 1570  3    use is made of cliches and stereotypes, in themselves
G23 1580  1    declarations of intellectual bankruptcy.
G23 1580  5       We are reminded, however, that freedom of thought
G23 1590  5    and discussion, the unfettered exchange of ideas, is
G23 1600  4    basic under our form of government.
G23 1600 10       Assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom
G23 1610  7    to think, to examine any and all issues, and to speak
G23 1620  6    without restraint. No holds are barred. But have the
G23 1630  3    results been heartening? May we state with confidence
G23 1630 11    that in such an exhibition a republic will find its
G23 1640 10    greatest security?
G23 1650  1       We must not forget, to be sure, that free discussion
G23 1650 11    and debate have produced beneficial results. In truth,
G23 1660  7    we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph
G23 1670  6    McCarthy, who was finally exposed in full light to
G23 1680  5    the American people. If he had been "liquidated" in
G23 1690  2    some way, he would have become a martyr, a rallying
G23 1690 12    point for people who shared his ideas. Debate in the
G23 1700  8    political arena can be productive of good. But it is
G23 1710  6    a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce negative
G23 1720  2    results but not much that is positive. Debate rid us
G23 1720 12    of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive.
G23 1730 11    It did something to clear the ground, but it erected
G23 1740  8    no striking new structure; it did not even provide
G23 1750  5    the architect's plan for anything new.
G23 1760  1       In the field of the natural sciences, scientifically
G23 1760  9    verified data are quite readily available and any discussion
G23 1770  7    can be shortened with good results. In the field of
G23 1780  6    the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge
G23 1790  3    has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage.
G23 1800  1       By no means would we discourage the production of
G23 1800 10    ideas: they provide raw materials with which to work;
G23 1810  9    they provide stimulations that lead to further production.
G23 1820  6    We would establish no censorship.
