R07 0010  1       One day, the children had wanted to get up onto
R07 0010 11    General Burnside's horse. They wanted to see what his
R07 0020  8    back felt like- the General's. He looked so comfortable
R07 0030  5    being straight. They wanted to touch the mystery. Arlene
R07 0040  4    was boosting them up when the policeman came by.
R07 0050  2       He was very rude.
R07 0050  6       Arlene had a hard voice, too, this time. The policeman's
R07 0060  4    eyes rather popped for a second; but then Arlene got
R07 0070  3    another tone in a hurry, and she said, "If it wasn't
R07 0080  1    for these dear children"-.
R07 0080  5       The policeman got a confused, funny look on his
R07 0090  5    face, and he had answered kind of politely, "Now, look
R07 0100  2    here, lady: I know you got to entertain these kids
R07 0100 12    and all. But this is a public park and it's a city
R07 0110 11    ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on".
R07 0120  5       Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when
R07 0130  4    she said, "Yes, sir".
R07 0130  8       The policeman walked on, but he looked back once.
R07 0140  7       That had happened on the day when two other unusual
R07 0150  3    things had occurred. Arlene had taught them a new way
R07 0160  1    to have fun in their little private area; and they
R07 0160 11    had told their mother about the tumbles. In matters
R07 0170  7    of exact information, that kept her one step behind
R07 0180  5    developments; and so they were consistently true to
R07 0190  2    their principles.
R07 0190  4       "Never mind", Arlene had said, after the policeman
R07 0200  3    had left, having pursued the usual unco-operative course
R07 0210  1    of grownups. "Never mind. I know something that is
R07 0210 10    much more fun that we can do on our little lawn".
R07 0220  9       "What is it"? asked the children, whose reflexes
R07 0230  5    and replies were invariably so admirably normal and
R07 0240  3    predictable. Maybe that was why they were cordial and
R07 0250  1    loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene.
R07 0250  7       "Just you wait", advised Arlene, echoing the dialogue
R07 0260  6    in a recent British movie.
R07 0270  1       And when they had got to their little lawn, they
R07 0270 11    had had a most twirlingly magnificent time. First,
R07 0280  5    Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults.
R07 0290  4    They had protested that that wasn't any surprise.
R07 0300  2       "Just you wait", said Arlene again, as though she
R07 0310  2    were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations
R07 0310  8    of that handy little sturdy statement. "This is a warm-up".
R07 0320  9       "Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal"? asked
R07 0330  7    one of the children.
R07 0340  1       "Not the least bit", Arlene snapped. One of the
R07 0340 10    many things that was so nice about her was that she
R07 0350 10    always took your questions seriously, particularly
R07 0360  2    your very, very serious questions. Those were especially
R07 0370  2    the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest.
R07 0370 11    She would sometimes even get a little hard on you,
R07 0380  9    she took you so seriously. But not hard for very long.
R07 0390  7    Just long enough to make you feel important.
R07 0400  1       "Now", said Arlene, eventually, making them both
R07 0410  1    sit in formation on a big root of a live oak, the sort
R07 0410 14    of root that divided itself and made their bottoms
R07 0420  6    sag down and feel comfortable. "Now, we're going to
R07 0430  4    be like what General Burnside and his horse make us
R07 0440  2    think of".
R07 0440  4       The children looked at each other and sagged their
R07 0450  3    bottoms down even more comfortably than ever. Their
R07 0450 11    curiosity went happily out of bounds.
R07 0460  6       Then, Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled
R07 0470  4    in a way that was just wonderful. She held herself
R07 0480  1    that way and turned her head towards them and laughed
R07 0480 11    and winked. "Imagine being able to laugh and wink when
R07 0490  9    you're like the top part of that picture frame at home",
R07 0500  7    one of them said. They both laughed and winked back.
R07 0510  4       "I'm General Burnside's horse, upside down", Arlene
R07 0520  3    said, sort of gaspingly, for her: even she had to breathe
R07 0530  3    kind of funny when she was in that position. She made
R07 0530 14    General Burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it
R07 0540  9    was upside down. Then, she was back on her feet, winking
R07 0550  9    and smiling that enormous smile (she had lots of wonderful
R07 0560  7    big teeth that you never would have suspected she had
R07 0570  3    when she was not smiling). And she would wink and throw
R07 0580  1    kisses. They both tried to keep smiling and winking
R07 0580 10    for a long time, but it made their lips and eyelids
R07 0590  8    tremble. But they kept on clapping for a long, long
R07 0600  6    time.
R07 0600  7       "This time", Arlene said, and she even kept on wiggling
R07 0610  7    a little bit while she was just talking, "you're going
R07 0620  3    to tell me what I am and what I'm doing. It all has
R07 0630  3    something to do with General Burnside and his horse".
R07 0630 12       This time, it was so grand; they could tell exactly
R07 0640 11    what it was. It was General Burnside's horse running
R07 0650  7    in a circle. His legs shook, and the shaking went right
R07 0660  7    on up his body through his hips to his shoulders. "That's
R07 0670  4    the General's horse", one of them cried out.
R07 0680  2       The other remarked, in a happy laughter, "That's
R07 0690  1    a funny old horse".
R07 0690  5       The first one said, "He sure does shake. He's old".
R07 0700  3       Then there was the General kissing his wife. They
R07 0710  3    had to be told that one. But it was even funnier after
R07 0720  1    they had been told. Their father, when he came back
R07 0720 11    from those many business trips, just bumped their mother
R07 0730  7    on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody
R07 0740  5    had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the
R07 0750  2    electric icebox. But not General Burnside. He was the
R07 0750 11    funniest man. He never could keep still, even when
R07 0760  9    he didn't move his feet.
R07 0770  1       Then, they had to get up and be General Burnside.
R07 0770 11    Or his horse. All they could think of was to run around
R07 0780 11    in circles, kicking their legs out. It wasn't very
R07 0790  7    funny. Then, they said General Burnside was going to
R07 0800  5    jump over his horse's head; and they did some somersaults.
R07 0810  2    But that wasn't very funny, either.
R07 0810  8       "You ought to shake", Arlene advised them. And Arlene
R07 0820  9    showed them how to begin. She also taught them to sing
R07 0830  9    "I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate". That helped
R07 0840  6    a lot. They were clumsy, but they were beginning to
R07 0850  4    catch on. They also caught on a little bit on how to
R07 0860  1    smile a lot without your lips trembling. "Imagine you
R07 0860 10    won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling-
R07 0870  8    or smiling with your lips trembling too much", Arlene
R07 0880  6    suggested.
R07 0880  7       That helped a great deal.
R07 0890  3    ##
R07 0890  4    They were a little late in getting home.
R07 0900  1       "I'm sorry, Mrs. Minks", Arlene said in a tone so
R07 0900 10    low you could hardly hear it.
R07 0910  4       My mother constituted herself the voice of all of
R07 0920  4    us. "It's perfectly understandable, Arlene", my mother
R07 0930  1    said in a friendly way. "I suppose you all were playing
R07 0930 12    and forgot"?
R07 0940  1       "Yes, ma'am", the children chorused heartily.
R07 0950  1       We couldn't help laughing.
R07 0950  5       The children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters;
R07 0960  6    and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open. "Arlene's
R07 0970  3    a good girl", my uncle remarked to us; but he said
R07 0980  3    it too soon, for it came out just before the tap to
R07 0980 15    which the door responded. That tap had a slight bangish
R07 0990  9    quality.
R07 0990 10       "She really is a dear little thing", my mother agreed.
R07 1000 10    Her upper lip lifted slightly. She was biting into
R07 1010  6    a small red radish; and that action always caused her
R07 1020  4    to lift her lip from the sting of the thing. Also,
R07 1030  1    she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm
R07 1030 11    curled up in a neat, mean little heap at the white
R07 1040  9    center of the radish. She would try to see over the
R07 1050  6    bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to
R07 1060  2    the place where she was biting. It never worked, naturally;
R07 1060 12    but it made her look unusual. Also, when she had bitten
R07 1070 11    off half of the small radish, she found the suspense
R07 1080  6    unbearable; and she would snatch the finger-held half
R07 1090  5    of the radish out to where she could inspect it. One
R07 1100  2    could hear a very faint, ladylike sigh of relief. Actually,
R07 1100 12    it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it. But the
R07 1110 10    warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general
R07 1120  7    public.
R07 1120  8       Later on, the children told her further about somersaulting.
R07 1130  6    "It must be awfully good for them. And awfully kind
R07 1140  6    of Arlene", she told us later. "But do you know something
R07 1150  5    curious"? she added. "I reached into that funny little
R07 1160  4    pocket that is high up on my dress. I have no notion
R07 1170  1    why I reached. And I found a radish. Was it an omen?
R07 1170 13    I thought for a second. But I would not pamper myself
R07 1180 10    in that silly way. I opened the window and threw the
R07 1190  8    radish out".
R07 1190 10       Then, my mother blushed at this small lie; for she
R07 1200  8    knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made
R07 1210  5    one more radish that night just too impossible a strain.
R07 1220  3    ##
R07 1220  4    Arlene became indispensable; nobody could have told
R07 1230  2    why. But she was. It was in the air.
R07 1230 11       A friend of my father's came to dinner. He was passing
R07 1240  7    through town and phoned to say hello. As a result,
R07 1250  5    he was persuaded out to dinner. As a matter of fact,
R07 1260  2    this happened every four or five months. Sometimes,
R07 1260 10    he coincided with my father's being at home. Sometimes,
R07 1270  8    as at this juncture, he did not. But he was always
R07 1280  7    persuaded out.
R07 1280  9       he liked children, in a loathsome kind of way; the
R07 1300  8    two youngest in our family always had to be brought
R07 1320  2    in and put through tricks for his entertainment. When
R07 1320 11    he had left, I could never remember whether he had
R07 1330 10    poked them in their middles, laughingly, with a thick
R07 1340  6    index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort
R07 1350  5    of person who did this that one assumed the action,
R07 1360  1    not bothering to look. The children loathed him, too.
R07 1360 10       This evening, they were pushed in from the breakfast
R07 1370  8    room, with odds and ends of dessert distributed over
R07 1380  5    them. There had been some coconut in it, for I remember
R07 1390  4    my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit
R07 1400  1    of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting
R07 1400 14    down her radish with a shiver.
R07 1410  4       They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene-
R07 1420  3    whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly
R07 1420 12    back around to the kitchen side of the door. We had
R07 1430 11    just sat down.
R07 1440  1       "Tell Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days",
R07 1440  9    my mother advised the children, ceremonially.
R07 1450  5       There was an air of revolt about the children- even
R07 1460  5    irreverence for their own principles. This could be
R07 1470  3    told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing,
R07 1470 13    a horselike balkiness of demeanor. Possibly, the
R07 1480  7    coconut-containing
R07 1480  9    dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration.
R07 1490  8    But, at the beginning, this stayed just in the air.
R07 1500  7       "We go to the park with this nice lady", one of
R07 1510  6    them said. "We have good times".
R07 1520  1       This happy bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc. "You
R07 1520  8    do"? he asked, between wheezes of laughter. He was
R07 1530  9    forced to wipe his eyes. "You don't step on the flowers,
R07 1540  7    do you? Eh"?
R07 1550  1       One of the children maneuvered out of range of the
R07 1550 10    poking index finger.
R07 1560  1       "No", he said. "We don't".
R07 1560  6       Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry. He was so
R07 1570 10    long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her
R07 1580  5    sherry for dregs. Usually, this was done when attention
R07 1590  2    was diverted by someone else's long, boring story.
R07 1590 10    But this time she was nervous: she was open.
R07 1600  8       Mr. Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind
R07 1610  6    again. "Tell me- what do you do at the park"? he asked.
R07 1620  5    This was delivered in a forthright way, without coyness
R07 1630  2    and over-pretended interest- an admirable way with
R07 1630 10    children. Only, unfortunately, he could not remove
R07 1640  7    from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct
R07 1650  5    command. This nettled the children into the revelation
R07 1660  2    of exact truth, a sacrifice of their secret superiority
R07 1670  1    over grown people, but a victory in the wide fields
R07 1670 11    of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment.
R07 1680  3       "We bump", one said; and the other went on to development
R07 1690  7    of the idea. "We grind, too", he said.
R07 1700  2       My mother was beside herself with curiosity. "Say
R07 1700 10    that again", she pleaded. She laughed a little and
R07 1710  9    tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass. "You
R07 1720  6    what"? She could see that Mr. Gorboduc was intrigued;
R07 1730  4    the hostess in her took over. She was rollickingly
R07 1740  2    happy. "You what"?
R07 1740  5       My uncle looked at Mr. Gorboduc. He read Henry James
R07 1750  6    and used to pretend profundity through eye-beamings
R07 1760  4    at people.
R07 1760  6       Mr. Gorboduc looked down. He would not look up.
R07 1770  5    He was very funny about the whole thing.
