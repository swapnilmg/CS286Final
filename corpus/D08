D08 0010  1    But, again, we have no real evidence on this from that
D08 0010 12    quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D.,
D08 0020  8    when an Arabic scholar, Tabit ibn Korra (836-901) is
D08 0030  6    said to have discussed the magic square of three. Thus,
D08 0040  3    while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or
D08 0050  1    the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square
D08 0050 10    of three before the Chinese did, more definite evidence
D08 0060  7    will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical
D08 0070  7    World before China can lose her claim to the earliest
D08 0080  5    known magic square by more than a thousand years.
D08 0090  1    #2. THE "LO SHU" SQUARE AS AN EXPRESSION OF CENTRALITY#
D08 0100  1    The concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace, strong
D08 0110  9    and united under a forceful ruler, which had been only
D08 0120  7    a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States,
D08 0130  3    was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese
D08 0140  1    Empire under the Ch'in dynasty (221-207 B.C.). But
D08 0140 10    this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and
D08 0150  8    extremes of totalitarian despotism. Among the many
D08 0160  5    severe measures taken by the First Emperor, Shih Huang-ti,
D08 0170  4    in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won
D08 0180  4    national unity, was the burning of the books in 213
D08 0180 14    B.C., with the expressed intention of removing possible
D08 0190  8    sources for divergent thinking; but, as he had a special
D08 0200  9    fondness for magic and divination, he ordered that
D08 0210  5    books on these subjects should be spared. Many of the
D08 0220  4    latter were destroyed in their turn, during the burning
D08 0230  1    of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later; yet
D08 0230 11    some must have survived, because the old interest in
D08 0240  7    number symbolism, divination, and magic persisted on
D08 0250  5    into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting
D08 0260  1    China and keeping it together for a longer period (from
D08 0260 11    202 B.C. to A.D. 220). In fact, during the first century
D08 0280  4    B.C., an extensive literature sprang up devoted to
D08 0290  2    these subjects, finding its typical expression in the
D08 0290 10    so-called "wei books", a number of which were specifically
D08 0300  9    devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams,
D08 0310  8    especially in connection with divination. However,
D08 0320  4    the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox
D08 0330  6    Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription
D08 0340  2    in 605.
D08 0340  4       After all this destruction of old literature, it
D08 0350  2    should be obvious why we have so little information
D08 0350 11    about the early history and development of the Lo Shu,
D08 0360  9    which was already semisecret anyhow. But, in spite
D08 0370  6    of all this, enough evidence remains to show that the
D08 0380  5    magic square of three must indeed have been the object
D08 0390  1    of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching
D08 0390 11    fullest expression in the Han period.
D08 0400  6       Although modern scholars have expressed surprise
D08 0410  3    that "the simple magic square of three", a mere "mathematical
D08 0420  2    puzzle", was able to exert a considerable influence
D08 0430  1    on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese
D08 0430 10    for so many centuries, they could have found most of
D08 0440  7    the answers right within the square itself. But, up
D08 0460  4    to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent
D08 0470  1    mathematical properties, or the numerical significance
D08 0470  7    of its numbers- singly or in combination- and then
D08 0480  9    tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese
D08 0490  6    cosmological concepts.
D08 0490  8       Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle
D08 0500  6    number of the Lo Shu, 5, was so vitally significant
D08 0510  5    for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that
D08 0520  2    they had a knowledge of this diagram. The importance
D08 0520 11    of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical
D08 0530 10    properties of the middle number and its special relationship
D08 0540  8    to all the rest of the numbers- quite apart from any
D08 0550  5    numerological considerations, which is to say, any
D08 0560  4    symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it. Indeed,
D08 0560 11    mathematically speaking, it was both functionally and
D08 0570  7    symbolically the most important number in the entire
D08 0580  6    diagram.
D08 0580  7       If one takes the middle number, 5, and multiplies
D08 0590  5    it by 3 (the base number of the magic square of three),
D08 0600  4    the result is 15, which is also the constant sum of
D08 0610  1    all the rows, columns, and two main diagonals. Then,
D08 0610 10    if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential
D08 0620  7    in terms of this square, through multiplying it by
D08 0630  4    the highest number, 9 (which is the square of the base
D08 0640  3    number), the result is 45; and the latter is the total
D08 0640 14    sum of all the numbers in the square, by which all
D08 0650 11    the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they
D08 0660  6    may be said to be absorbed.
D08 0660 12       Furthermore, the middle number of the Lo Shu is
D08 0670  9    not only the physical mean between every opposing pair
D08 0680  6    of the other numbers, by reason of its central position;
D08 0690  4    it is also their mathematical mean, since it is equal
D08 0700  3    to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which
D08 0700 14    equal 10. In fact, the neat balance of these pairs,
D08 0710  9    and their subtle equilibrium, would have had special
D08 0720  5    meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese. For they considered
D08 0730  4    the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female,
D08 0740  1    equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles
D08 0740 11    in Nature; and in this square, the respective pairs
D08 0750  8    made up of large and small odd (Yang) numbers, and
D08 0760  6    those composed of large and small even (Yin) numbers,
D08 0770  3    were all equal to each other. Thus all differences
D08 0770 12    were leveled, and all contrasts erased, in a realm
D08 0780  9    of no distinction, and the harmonious balance of the
D08 0790  6    Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world
D08 0800  4    in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.
D08 0810  1       The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square-
D08 0820  3    for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that
D08 0820 11    this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center
D08 0830  7    of the universe, could well explain why the Old Chinese
D08 0840  5    seem to have so revered the number 5, and why they
D08 0850  3    put so much stress on the concept of Centrality. These
D08 0850 13    twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in
D08 0860  9    the Han dynasty.
D08 0870  1       The existing reverence for Centrality must have
D08 0870  8    been still further stimulated toward the close of the
D08 0880  7    second century B.C., when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered
D08 0890  7    the dynastic color changed to yellow- which symbolized
D08 0900  5    the Center among the traditional Five Directions- and
D08 0910  4    took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would
D08 0910 14    thus place himself, his imperial family, and the nation
D08 0920  9    under the most auspicious influences. His immediate
D08 0930  4    motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired
D08 0940  4    by the Lo Shu, but this measure must inevitably have
D08 0950  2    increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.
D08 0960  1       After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze
D08 0960  9    mirrors, as well as other writings, emphasized the
D08 0970  6    desirability of keeping one's self at the center of
D08 0980  6    the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest. Later,
D08 0990  2    we shall see what happened when an emperor took this
D08 0990 12    idea too literally.
D08 1000  2       All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number
D08 1010  1    5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems
D08 1010 11    to have begun as far back as 400 B.C., also may conceivably
D08 1020 10    have led to the development of the Five-Elements School
D08 1030  6    and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical
D08 1040  5    categories of five. We find, for example, such groupings
D08 1050  3    as the Five Ancient Rulers, the Five Sacred Mountains,
D08 1060  1    the Five Directions (with Center), the Five Metals,
D08 1060  9    Five Colors, Five Tastes, Five Odors, Five Musical
D08 1070  8    Notes, Five Bodily Functions, Five Viscera, and many
D08 1080  7    others. This trend has often been ascribed to the cult
D08 1090  7    of the Five Elements itself, as though they had served
D08 1100  4    as the base for all the rest; but why did the Old Chinese
D08 1110  2    postulate five elements, when the Ancient Near East-
D08 1120  3    which may have initiated the idea that natural elements
D08 1120 12    exerted influence in human life and activities- recognized
D08 1130  7    only four? And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to
D08 1140  7    talk about the Five Directions, when the animals they
D08 1150  5    used as symbols of the directions designated only the
D08 1160  2    usual four? Obviously, something suddenly caused them
D08 1160  9    to start thinking in terms of fives, and that may have
D08 1170 10    been the workings of the Lo Shu.
D08 1190  4       This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on
D08 1200  2    Chinese thinking. Whereas the primary meanings of the
D08 1200 10    Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner
D08 1210 10    mathematical properties- and we shall see that even
D08 1220  9    its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical
D08 1230  3    bases- the urgent desire to place everything into categories
D08 1240  2    of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers,
D08 1240 12    until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded
D08 1250  8    Chinese thought. Scholars made numbered sets of as
D08 1260  7    many things as possible in Nature, or assigned arbitrary
D08 1270  4    numbers to individual things, in a fashion that seems
D08 1280  2    to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical,
D08 1280 10    and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended
D08 1290  8    to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries.
D08 1300  6    #3. YIN AND YANG IN THE "LO SHU" SQUARE#
D08 1310  2    Although the primary mathematical properties of the
D08 1310  9    middle number at the center of the Lo Shu, and the
D08 1320 11    interrelation of all the other numbers to it, might
D08 1330  9    seem enough to account for the deep fascination which
D08 1340  3    the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers, this
D08 1350  2    was actually only a beginning of wonders. For the Lo
D08 1360  1    Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of
D08 1360  9    most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas
D08 1370  5    of its time. As such, one cannot fully understand the
D08 1380  4    thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing
D08 1390  2    the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu; but, conversely,
D08 1400  1    one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing
D08 1400 11    something about the world view of the Old Chinese,
D08 1410  9    which they felt they saw expressed in it.
D08 1420  5       The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty, when
D08 1430  2    the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its
D08 1440  1    popularity, was based in large part on the teachings
D08 1440 10    of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School, which was
D08 1450  7    traditionally founded by Tsou Yen. According to this
D08 1460  5    doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven, T'ien-
D08 1470  1    as a natural force, or in the personification of a
D08 1470 11    Supreme Sky-god- governing all things by means of a
D08 1480 10    process called the Tao, which can be roughly interpreted
D08 1500  6    as "the Order of the Universe" or "the Universal Way".
D08 1510  5    Heaven, acting through the Tao, expressed itself by
D08 1520  4    means of the workings of two basic principles, the
D08 1530  2    Yin and the Yang. The Yang, or male principle, was
D08 1530 12    the source of light, heat, and dynamic vitality, associated
D08 1540  8    with the Sun; while the Yin, or female principle, flourished
D08 1550  7    in darkness, cold, and quiet inactivity, and was associated
D08 1560  5    with the Moon. Together these two principles influenced
D08 1570  3    all things, and in varying combinations they were present
D08 1580  2    in everything.
D08 1580  4       We have already seen that odd numbers were considered
D08 1590  3    as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so
D08 1600  1    that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented
D08 1600 11    these two principles in balanced equilibrium around
D08 1610  6    the axial center. During the Han dynasty, another Yin-Yang
D08 1620  7    conception was applied to the Lo Shu, considering the
D08 1630  4    latter as a plan of Ancient China. Instead of linking
D08 1640  3    the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional
D08 1640 12    Nine Provinces, as was usually done, this equated the
D08 1650  5    odd, Yang numbers with mountains (firm and resistant,
D08 1660  6    hence Yang) and the even numbers with rivers (sinuous
D08 1670  4    and yielding, hence Yin); taking the former from the
D08 1680  3    Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter
D08 1680 13    from the principal river systems of Old China.
D08 1690  8       Thus the middle number, 5, represented Sung-Shan
D08 1700  6    in Honan, Central China; the 3, T'ai-Shan in Shantung,
D08 1710  6    East China; the 7, Hwa-Shan in Shensi, West China;
D08 1720  3    the 1, Heng-Shan in Hopei, North China (or the mountain
D08 1730  3    with the same name in neighboring Shansi); and the
D08 1740  1    9, Huo-Shan in Anhwei, which was then the South Sacred
D08 1740 12    Mountain. For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai,
D08 1750  9    to the (then) Southeast; the 2, the San Kiang (three
D08 1760  7    rivers) in the (then) Southwest; the 8, the Chi in
D08 1770  6    the Northeast; and the 6, the (upper) Yellow River
D08 1780  1    in the Northwest.
D08 1780  4       Note that by Western standards this plan was "upside
D08 1790  4    down", as it put North at the bottom and South at the
D08 1800  3    top, with the other directions correspondingly altered;
D08 1800 10    but in this respect it was merely following the accepted
D08 1810  9    Chinese convention for all maps. The same arrangement
D08 1820  7    was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine
D08 1830  5    Provinces; and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional
D08 1840  3    symbolism, it was oriented in this same fashion.
