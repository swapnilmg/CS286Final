F25 0010  1       My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait
F25 0010  9    of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish
F25 0020  7    identity was often confused with social and economic
F25 0030  5    strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive",
F25 0040  2    a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get ahead".
F25 0050  2    When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I
F25 0050 11    encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith
F25 0060  8    good will, and a small residue of ethnic loyalty.
F25 0070  7       "I like the tradition", a girl said. "I like to
F25 0080  7    follow the holidays when they come along. But you don't
F25 0090  4    have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate
F25 0100  1    in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference
F25 0100 13    between being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".
F25 0110  6       Another teen-ager remarked: "Most Jews don't believe
F25 0120  6    in God, but they believe in people- in helping people".
F25 0130  6    Still another boy asserted: "To be a good Jew is to
F25 0140  8    do no wrong; it's to be a good person". When asked
F25 0150  3    how this was different from being a good Protestant,
F25 0160  1    the boy answered, "It's the same thing".
F25 0160  8       This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad.
F25 0170  8    They discovered that, although 42 per cent of a sample
F25 0180  7    of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants
F25 0190  2    believed it important to live in accordance with the
F25 0190 11    teachings of their religion, only 8 per cent of the
F25 0200 10    Jewish students had this conviction. The most important
F25 0210  5    aims of the Jewish students were as follows: to make
F25 0220  4    the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent; to
F25 0230  2    get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial
F25 0230 11    independence- 21 per cent.
F25 0240  6       Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers I interviewed
F25 0250  3    believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even
F25 0260  1    envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However,
F25 0260  8    they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to
F25 0270  6    believe in Judaism "but in a moderate way". One boy
F25 0280  5    said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's the twentieth
F25 0290  3    century, and they don't have to wear beards".
F25 0300  1       The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral
F25 0300  9    faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers'
F25 0310  9    minds. "We were brought up that way" was one statement
F25 0320  7    which won general assent. "I want to show respect for
F25 0330  6    my parents' religion" was the way in which a boy justified
F25 0340  4    his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still another
F25 0350  2    suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons,
F25 0360  1    since I'll be living in a suburb".
F25 0360  8       Intermarriage, which is generally regarded as a
F25 0370  6    threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not with horror
F25 0380  3    or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.
F25 0390  1    Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on
F25 0390 11    pragmatic grounds. "When you marry, you want to have
F25 0400  9    things in common", a girl said, "and it's hard when
F25 0410  7    you don't marry someone with your own background".
F25 0420  3       A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed
F25 0430  3    wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently
F25 0430 10    interfered with religious activities- at least with
F25 0440  7    the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews
F25 0450  6    now regard as religious. It appears that an Orthodox
F25 0460  4    girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing
F25 0470  1    sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because
F25 0470 10    she would not travel on Saturday and, in addition,
F25 0480  8    required kosher food. Another girl from a relatively
F25 0490  5    large midwestern city described herself as "the only
F25 0500  2    Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate,
F25 0510  1    but it does convey how isolated she feels among the
F25 0510 11    vast army of the nonobservant.
F25 0520  1    #THE OLDER TEENS#
F25 0520  4    One of the significant things about Jewish culture
F25 0530  3    in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.
F25 0550  1    Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college
F25 0560  1    age attend institutions of higher learning. This is
F25 0560  9    substantially higher than the figures for the American
F25 0570  7    population at large- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2
F25 0580  6    per cent for females. This may help explain a phenomenon
F25 0590  3    described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first
F25 0590 13    two years in high school, Jewish boys in this town
F25 0600 10    make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school
F25 0610  7    teams. However, in their junior and senior years, they
F25 0620  4    generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably
F25 0630  1    in the interest of better academic achievement. It
F25 0630  9    is significant, too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed
F25 0640  9    believed, unlike the younger ones, that Jewish students
F25 0650  6    tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts.
F25 0660  4       The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college
F25 0670  4    is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations
F25 0680  1    for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational
F25 0680 11    motive is the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls
F25 0690  9    attend college for social reasons and to become culturally
F25 0700  6    developed. One of the significant developments in American-Jewish
F25 0710  5    life is that the cultural consumers are largely the
F25 0720  4    women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish best-sellers
F25 0730  3    and then persuade their husbands to read them.
F25 0740  1       In upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group
F25 0740  9    tends to have a sense of marginality. "People automatically
F25 0750  5    assume that I'm in college", a nineteen-year-old machinist
F25 0760  6    observed irritably. However, among the girls, there
F25 0770  4    are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going
F25 0780  1    to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably
F25 0780  9    works in an office- in contradistinction to gentile
F25 0790  5    factory workers- and, buttressed by a respectable income,
F25 0800  5    she is likely to dress better and live more expansively
F25 0810  3    than the college student. She is even prone to regard
F25 0820  1    the college girl as immature.
F25 0820  6    #THE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS COLLEGE STUDENT#
F25 0830  1    One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish
F25 0830 11    teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews
F25 0840 10    are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost.
F25 0850  6    This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish
F25 0860  3    population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
F25 0870  1       What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers
F25 0870 11    is that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate
F25 0880  7    them from their gentile counterparts, they actually
F25 0890  3    lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos
F25 0900  3    with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish
F25 0910  1    world.
F25 0910  2       Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College-
F25 0920  3    constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day
F25 0920 13    session- can serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle
F25 0930 10    class Jewish student.
F25 0940  1       There is, to begin, an important sex difference.
F25 0940  9    Typically, in a lower-middle class Jewish family, a
F25 0950  8    son will be sent to an out-of-town school, if financial
F25 0960  4    resources warrant it, while the daughter will attend
F25 0970  2    the local college. There are two reasons for this.
F25 0970 11    First, the girl's education has a lower priority than
F25 0980  9    the son's. Second, the attitude in Jewish families
F25 0990  6    is far more protective toward the daughter than toward
F25 1000  3    the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise
F25 1010  1    vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their
F25 1010 10    daughters by keeping them home. The consequence of
F25 1020  7    this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber
F25 1030  3    the boys and do somewhat better academically. One can
F25 1040  3    assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.
F25 1040 14       Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude
F25 1050  8    toward their school. On the one hand, there is a sense
F25 1060 10    of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high
F25 1070  6    school. This is particularly acute for those who attended
F25 1080  4    Midwood High School directly across the street from
F25 1090  2    Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality
F25 1090 10    at being denied that special badge of status, the out-of-town
F25 1100 10    school. At the same time, there is a good deal of
F25 1110  8    self-congratulation
F25 1110 10    at attending a good college- they are even inclined
F25 1120  5    to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues- and they
F25 1130  3    express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that
F25 1140  2    the college generates. "It's people of your own kind",
F25 1140 11    a girl remarked. "You don't have to watch what you
F25 1150  9    say. Of course, I would like to go to an out-of-town
F25 1160 11    school where there are all kinds of people, but I would
F25 1170  6    want lots of Jewish kids there".
F25 1170 12       For most Brooklyn College students, college is at
F25 1180  8    once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and
F25 1190  6    a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family.
F25 1200  3    @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone, and
F25 1210  3    efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably
F25 1220  1    midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.
F25 1220  9    However, a growing intellectual sophistication and
F25 1230  5    the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology
F25 1240  4    and anthropology make the students increasingly critical
F25 1250  2    of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents.
F25 1250  9    And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is
F25 1260  9    not the traditional conflict of culture but, rather,
F25 1270  6    a protest against a culture that they view as softly
F25 1280  4    and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home, I'll
F25 1290  2    never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.
F25 1300  1    "They don't like it if I do anything away from home.
F25 1300 12    It's so much trouble, I don't usually bother".
F25 1310  7       For girls, the overprotection is far more pervasive.
F25 1320  5    Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their
F25 1330  5    daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting. A
F25 1340  2    freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean
F25 1340 12    at Brooklyn College and demanded the "low-down" on
F25 1350  8    a boy who was going out with his daughter. The domestic
F25 1360  6    tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field.
F25 1370  5    Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn
F25 1380  1    College girls major in education since that co-ordinates
F25 1380 10    best with marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement
F25 1390  7    and convenient working hours. This means that a great
F25 1400  8    many academically talented girls are discouraged from
F25 1410  4    pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.
F25 1420  1    A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys
F25 1420 11    and girls as it does in the realm of sex.
F25 1430  9       The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn
F25 1440  4    is gradual. First, the student trains on his hapless
F25 1450  2    parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological
F25 1460  1    and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence,
F25 1460  9    there is actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide
F25 1470  9    world beyond the precincts of New York. It is significant
F25 1480  7    that the Catskills, which used to be the summer playground
F25 1490  5    for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb of New
F25 1500  3    York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except
F25 1500 12    for those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors
F25 1510 11    in the day camps. The great world beyond beckons. But
F25 1520  8    it should be pointed out that some of the new watering
F25 1530  7    places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, Long Island,
F25 1540  3    for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish. Although
F25 1550  2    Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad
F25 1560  1    program, a good number of students spend summers in
F25 1560 10    Europe. In general, however, the timetable of travel
F25 1570  7    lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard
F25 1580  6    or Smith. And acculturation into the world at large
F25 1590  3    is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student
F25 1590 12    after college rather than during the four school years.
F25 1600  9       Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory,
F25 1610  6    as much as the Bronx or Central Park West. There are
F25 1620  6    hordes of nubile young women there who, prodded by
F25 1630  4    their impatient mothers, are determined to marry. It
F25 1640  2    is interesting that, although the percentage of married
F25 1640 10    students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than
F25 1650  8    elsewhere- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per
F25 1660  8    cent of the men in the graduating class- the anxiety
F25 1670  5    of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost
F25 1680  1    everybody in the senior class is married", students
F25 1680  9    say dogmatically. And the school newspaper sells space
F25 1690  7    to jubilant fraternities, sororities, and houses (in
F25 1700  4    the House Plan Association) that have good news to
F25 1710  3    impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements
F25 1720  1    for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are
F25 1720  9    boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings,
F25 1730  6    pinnings, ringings, engagements, and marriages in a
F25 1740  4    scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House
F25 1750  1    happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to
F25 1750  9    Erwin Schwartz of Fife House".
F25 1760  4       The Brooklyn College student shows some striking
F25 1770  3    departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy
F25 1780  1    League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are
F25 1780 11    as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion,
F25 1790  7    or even in nondescript working class manner, as they
F25 1800  6    are in the restrained, button-down Ivy way. The girls
F25 1810  4    are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their
F25 1810 13    counterparts out of town, and eye shadow, mascara,
F25 1820  8    and elaborate bouffant hairdos- despite the admonitions
F25 1830  4    of cautious guidance personnel- are not unknown even
F25 1840  7    in early morning classes.
F25 1840 11       Among the boys, there is very little bravado about
F25 1850  8    drinking. Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having
F25 1860  6    an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale encampment
F25 1870  2    for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys.
