G37 0010  1    Fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged.
G37 0010 10    Another week passed and even the missionaries were
G37 0020  6    enjoying the voyage. The sickness was gone and, after
G37 0030  5    all, the two young couples were on their honeymoon.
G37 0040  1       The only lasting difficulty was the food. In spite
G37 0040 10    of Pickering Dodge's explicit instructions regarding
G37 0050  5    variation of meals, the food did not seem the same
G37 0060  7    as at home. "Everything tasted differently from what
G37 0070  3    it does on land and those things I was most fond of
G37 0070 15    at home, I loathed the most here", Ann noted. At last
G37 0080 11    they concluded that the heavy, full feeling in their
G37 0090  8    stomachs was due to lack of exercise. Walking was the
G37 0100  4    remedy, they decided, but a deck full of chicken coops
G37 0110  2    and pigpens was hardly suitable. Skipping was the alternative.
G37 0120  1    A rope was found and, like children in school, the
G37 0120 11    missionaries skipped for hours at a time. Finally,
G37 0130  8    tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise, they decided
G37 0140  5    to dance instead. It was much more fun, reminding the
G37 0150  2    girls of their old carefree days in the Hasseltine
G37 0150 11    frolics room at Bradford. The weather turned warmer
G37 0160  8    and with it came better appetites, although Harriet
G37 0170  4    was still a little off-color. She could not face coffee
G37 0180  4    or tea without milk, and was always craving types of
G37 0190  1    food that were not available aboard a sailing ship.
G37 0190 10    By now she was sure she was going to have a baby, deciding
G37 0200  9    it would be born in India or Burma that November. She
G37 0210  6    was more excited than frightened at the prospect of
G37 0220  3    having her first child in a foreign land.
G37 0220 11       The crew of the Caravan never failed to amaze Ann,
G37 0230  9    who during her stay in Salem must frequently have overheard
G37 0240  7    strong sailorly language. She wrote in her journal,
G37 0250  5    "I have not heard the least profane language since
G37 0260  2    I have been on board the vessel. This is very uncommon".
G37 0260 13       She was now enjoying the voyage very much. Even
G37 0270 10    the first wave of homesickness had passed, although
G37 0280  6    there were moments when Captain Heard pointed out on
G37 0290  5    his compass the direction of Bradford that she felt
G37 0300  2    a little twinge at her heart. As for Adoniram, she
G37 0300 12    found him to be "the kindest" of husbands.
G37 0310  7       On Sundays, with the permission of Captain Heard,
G37 0320  4    who usually attended with two of his officers, services
G37 0330  2    were held in the double cabin. Sometimes a ship would
G37 0330 12    be sighted and the Caravan pass so close that people
G37 0340 10    could easily be seen on the distant deck. Captain Heard
G37 0350  9    did not communicate with any strange vessels because
G37 0360  5    of the possibility of war between the United States
G37 0370  2    and Britain. As warmer temperatures were encountered
G37 0370  9    Ann and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of
G37 0380  9    bathing daily in salt water.
G37 0390  2       When May came the Caravan had already crossed the
G37 0400  2    Equator. They were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope;
G37 0400 12    the weather had turned wet and cold. At this time Harriet
G37 0410 11    wrote in a letter which after their finally landing
G37 0420  6    in India was sent to her mother:
G37 0430  1       "I care not how soon we reach Calcutta, and are
G37 0430 11    placed in a still room, with a bowl of milk and a loaf
G37 0440 13    of Indian bread. I can hardly think of this simple
G37 0450  7    fare without exclaiming, oh, what a luxury. I have
G37 0460  3    been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel,
G37 0460 13    and the almost intolerable smell after the rain, that
G37 0470  9    I have done little more than lounge on the bed for
G37 0480  8    several days. But I have been blest with excellent
G37 0490  3    spirits, and to-day have been running about the deck,
G37 0500  1    and dancing in our room for exercise, as well as ever".
G37 0500 12       While studying at the seminary in Andover, Adoniram
G37 0510  9    had been working on a New Testament translation from
G37 0520  7    the original Greek. He had brought it along to continue
G37 0530  7    during the voyage. There was one particular word that
G37 0540  3    troubled his conscience. This was the Greek word most
G37 0550  1    often translated as "baptism".
G37 0550  5       Born a Congregationalist, he had been baptized as
G37 0560  6    a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops
G37 0570  4    of water sprinkled on his head, yet nowhere in the
G37 0570 14    whole of the New Testament could he find a description
G37 0580  9    of anybody being baptized by sprinkling. John the Baptist
G37 0590  6    used total immersion in the River Jordan for believers;
G37 0600  4    even Christ was baptized by this method. The more Adoniram
G37 0610  1    looked at the Greek word for baptism, the more unhappy
G37 0620  1    he became over its true meaning.
G37 0620  7       As was only natural he confided his searchings to
G37 0630  5    Ann, conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as
G37 0635  3    if their own Congregationalists were wrong and the
G37 0640  6    Baptists right.
G37 0650  1       Ann was very troubled. By this time she had learned
G37 0650 11    that it was futile to argue with her young husband,
G37 0660 10    yet the uncomfortable fact remained: the American
G37 0670  5    Congregationalists
G37 0670  6    were sending them as missionaries to the Far East and
G37 0680  7    paying their salaries. What would happen if Adoniram
G37 0690  4    "changed horses in midstream"? Baptists and Congregationalists
G37 0700  2    in New England were on friendly terms. How embarrassing
G37 0710  1    it would be if the newly appointed Congregationalist
G37 0710  9    missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs
G37 0730  7    in order to embrace Baptist teachings!
G37 0740  2       "If you become a Baptist, I will not", Ann informed
G37 0750  3    her husband, but sweeping her threat aside Adoniram
G37 0760  1    continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma
G37 0760 11    in which he found himself.
G37 0770  3       By early June they were a hundred miles off the
G37 0780  1    coast of Ceylon, by which time all four missionaries
G37 0780 10    were hardened seafarers. Even Harriet could boldly
G37 0790  6    write, "I know not how it is; but I hear the thunder
G37 0800  6    roll; see the lightning flash; and the waves threatening
G37 0810  3    to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved".
G37 0820  1       Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly
G37 0820 10    and two strange tropical birds. Land was near, and
G37 0830  8    on June 12, one hundred and fourteen days after leaving
G37 0840  6    America, they actually saw, twenty miles away, the
G37 0850  3    coast of Orissa.
G37 0850  6       Captain Heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored
G37 0860  6    in the Bay of Bengal until he could obtain the services
G37 0870  3    of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow
G37 0870 13    waters.
G37 0880  1       Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man,
G37 0880 10    but Captain Heard was lucky. Next day a ship arrived
G37 0890  9    with an English pilot, his leadsman, an English youth,
G37 0900  6    and the first Hindu the Judsons and Newells had ever
G37 0910  4    seen. A little man with a "a dark copper color" skin,
G37 0920  2    he was wearing "calico trousers and a white cotton
G37 0920 11    short gown". Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance.
G37 0930  8    "He looks as feminine as you can imagine", she decided.
G37 0940  9       The pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling;
G37 0950  6    all day long the Caravan slowly made her way through
G37 0960  6    the difficult passages. Alas, to Ann's consternation,
G37 0970  2    his language while thus employed left much to be desired.
G37 0980  1    He swore so loudly at the top of his voice, that she
G37 0980 13    didn't get any sleep all the next night.
G37 0990  7       Next morning the Caravan was out of the treacherous
G37 1000  5    Bay. Relieved of the major part of his responsibility
G37 1010  1    for the safety of the ship, the pilot's oaths became
G37 1010 11    fewer. Slowly she moved up the Hooghli River, a mouth
G37 1020 10    of the mighty Ganges, toward Calcutta.
G37 1030  3       Ann was entranced with the view, as were her husband
G37 1040  4    and friends. Running across the deck, which was empty
G37 1050  1    now that the livestock had been killed and eaten, they
G37 1050 11    sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the
G37 1060  6    shore, each pointing out new and exciting wonders to
G37 1070  4    the other.
G37 1070  6       Out came the journal and in it went Ann's own description
G37 1080  5    of the scene:
G37 1080  8       "On each side of the Hoogli, where we are now sailing,
G37 1090  9    are the Hindoo cottages, as thick together as the houses
G37 1100  6    in our seaports. They are very small, and in the form
G37 1110  5    of haystacks, without either chimney or windows. They
G37 1120  1    are situated in the midst of trees, which hang over
G37 1120 11    them, and appear truly romantick. The grass and fields
G37 1130  7    of rice are perfectly green, and herds of cattle are
G37 1140  5    everywhere feeding on the banks of the river, and the
G37 1150  2    natives are scattered about differently employed. Some
G37 1150  9    are fishing, some driving the team, and many are sitting
G37 1160  9    indolently on the banks of the river. The pagodas we
G37 1170  7    have passed are much larger than the houses".
G37 1180  2       Harriet was just as delighted. Where were the hardships
G37 1190  1    she had expected? She was certain now that it would
G37 1190 11    be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant
G37 1200  9    surroundings than at home in the big white house in
G37 1210  7    Haverhill. With childlike innocence she wrote of the
G37 1220  3    Indians as "walking with fruit and umbrellas in their
G37 1220 12    hands, with the tawny children around them ... This
G37 1230  9    is the most delightful trial I have ever had", she
G37 1240  7    decided.
G37 1240  8       The Indians who came aboard ship to collect the
G37 1250  8    mail also interested her greatly, even if she was suitably
G37 1260  6    shocked, according to the customs of the society in
G37 1270  2    which she had been reared, to find them "naked, except
G37 1270 12    a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle".
G37 1280  8       At last they saw Calcutta, largest city of Bengal
G37 1290  7    and the Caravan's destination. Founded August 24, 1690
G37 1300  5    by Job Charnock of the East India Company, and commonly
G37 1310  4    called "The City of Palaces", it seemed a vast and
G37 1320  4    elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson. Solid brick
G37 1330  1    buildings painted dazzling white, large domes and tall,
G37 1330  9    picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could
G37 1340  8    see, while the wharves and harbor were filled with
G37 1350  4    tall-masted sailing ships. The noise stunned her. Crowds
G37 1360  2    flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly
G37 1360  9    in their strange-sounding Bengali tongue.
G37 1370  5       Harriet's mouth watered with anticipation when after
G37 1380  5    months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved
G37 1390  5    milk and fresh bread. Ann, pleased to see her friend
G37 1400  1    happy, was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of
G37 1400 11    Captain Heard had sent on board for their enjoyment.
G37 1410  8    Cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another
G37 1420  4    fruit whose taste she likened to that of "a rich pear".
G37 1430  3    Though she did not then know its name, this strange
G37 1430 13    new fruit was a banana.
G37 1440  5    #SIX#
G37 1440  6    The first act of Adoniram and Samuel on reaching Calcutta
G37 1450  4    was to report at the police station, a necessity when
G37 1460  2    landing in East India Company territory. On the way
G37 1460 11    they tried to discover all they could about Burma,
G37 1470  9    and they were disturbed to find that Michael Symes's
G37 1480  6    book had not presented an altogether true picture.
G37 1490  3    He had failed to realize that the Burmese were not
G37 1490 13    really treating him as the important visitor he considered
G37 1500  9    himself. They were in fact quietly laughing at him,
G37 1510  8    for their King wished to have nothing to do with the
G37 1520  6    Western world. When Captain John Gibault of Salem had
G37 1530  4    visited Burma in 1793 his ship, the Astra, had been
G37 1540  1    promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the
G37 1540 10    Irrawaddy River. Although after much trouble he did
G37 1550  7    manage to get it back, he discovered there was no trade
G37 1560  5    to be had. All Captain Gibault took back to Salem were
G37 1570  4    a few items for the town's East India Museum. A year
G37 1580  2    later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a
G37 1580 11    cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy. After
G37 1590  8    that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma.
G37 1600  5       The Burmese appeared to have little knowledge of
G37 1610  3    British power or any idea of trade. They despised foreigners.
G37 1620  2    Cruel Burmese governors could, on the slightest whim,
G37 1620 10    take a man's life. As for missionaries, even if they
G37 1630 10    succeeded in getting into the country they probably
G37 1640  6    would not be allowed to preach the Christian faith
G37 1650  3    to the Burmans. Unspeakable tortures or even execution
G37 1660  1    might well be their fate.
G37 1660  6       "Go back to America or any other place", well-meaning
G37 1670  5    friends of Captain Heard advised them, "but put thoughts
G37 1680  4    of going to Burma out of your heads".
G37 1680 12       Somewhat daunted, the two American missionaries
G37 1690  6    reached the police station where they were questioned
G37 1700  5    by a most unfriendly clerk. When he discovered they
G37 1710  2    had received from the Company's Court of Directors
G37 1720  1    no permission to live in India, coupled with the fact
G37 1720 11    that they were Americans who had been sent to Asia
G37 1730  8    to convert "the heathen", he became more belligerent
G37 1740  4    than ever.
G37 1740  6       They explained that they desired only to stop in
G37 1750  6    India until a ship traveling on to Burma could be found.
