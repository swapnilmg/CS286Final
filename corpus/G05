G05 0010  1       It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the
G05 0010 12    seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art.
G05 0020  9    The architects, the tile and carpet makers, the potters,
G05 0030  6    painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths worked through
G05 0040  3    Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich
G05 0050  1    the city. Travelers entering from the desert were confounded
G05 0050 10    by what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden
G05 0060 10    filled with nightingales and roses, cut by canals and
G05 0070  7    terraced promenades, studded with water tanks of turquoise
G05 0080  5    tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves
G05 0090  3    of a hundred domes. At the heart of all of this was
G05 0090 15    the square, which one such traveler declared to be
G05 0100  8    "as spacious, as pleasant and aromatick a Market as
G05 0110  6    any in the Universe". In time Isfahan came to be known
G05 0120  5    as "half the world", Isfahan nisf-i-jahan.
G05 0130  1       In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city,
G05 0130  9    then the size of London, started to decline. The Afghans
G05 0140  9    invaded; the Safavids fell from power; the capital
G05 0150  6    went elsewhere; the desert encroached. Isfahan became
G05 0160  3    more of a legend than a place, and now it is for many
G05 0170  3    people simply a name to which they attach their notions
G05 0170 13    of old Persia and sometimes of the East. They think
G05 0180 10    of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may
G05 0190  7    half see and half imagine the old splendor.
G05 0200  1       Those who actually get there find that it isn't
G05 0200 10    spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.
G05 0210 11    But even for them it remains a museum, or perhaps it
G05 0220  7    would be more accurate to say a tomb, a tomb in which
G05 0230  5    Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead. Everyone
G05 0240  1    is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost
G05 0240 11    no one is willing to acknowledge their present. It
G05 0250  7    seems that for Persia, and especially for this city,
G05 0260  5    there are only two times: the glorious past and the
G05 0270  3    corrupt, depressing, sterile present. The one apparent
G05 0270 10    connection between the two is a score of buildings
G05 0280  9    which somehow or other have survived and which naturally
G05 0290  6    enough are called "historical monuments".
G05 0300  1       However, just as all the buildings have not fallen
G05 0300 10    and flowed back to their original mud, so the values
G05 0310 10    which wanted them and saw that they were built have
G05 0320  8    not all disappeared. The values and talents which made
G05 0330  4    the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature,
G05 0340  1    continue in certain social institutions which rise
G05 0340  8    above the ordinary life of this city, as the great
G05 0350  9    buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes. Often,
G05 0360  5    too, the social institutions are housed in these pavilions
G05 0370  4    and palaces and bridges, for these great structures
G05 0380  1    are not simply "historical monuments"; they are the
G05 0380  9    places where Persians live.
G05 0390  3       The promenade, for example, continues to take place
G05 0400  2    on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and
G05 0400 13    poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal
G05 0410  8    street. ?t takes place as well along the terraces and
G05 0420  7    through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, and also in
G05 0430  4    the gardens of the square. On Fridays, the day when
G05 0440  1    many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar,
G05 0440 10    people do not, it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun-
G05 0450  8    a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas II in the
G05 0460  7    seventeenth century- but they do retire into hundreds
G05 0470  3    of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley,
G05 0480  1    which are smaller, more humble copies of the former.
G05 0480 10    And of course religious life continues to center in
G05 0490  7    the more famous mosques, and commercial life- very
G05 0500  2    much a social institution- in the bazaar. Those three
G05 0510  2    other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the
G05 0510 11    teahouse, and the zur khaneh (the latter a kind of
G05 0520 10    club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal
G05 0530  9    pit move through a rite of calisthenics, dance, chanted
G05 0540  3    poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings
G05 0550  1    to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them
G05 0550 11    occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture:
G05 0560  6    long, domed, chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise
G05 0570  6    tile, their end walls cut through to the orchards and
G05 0580  5    the sky by open arches.
G05 0580 10       But more important, and the thing which the casual
G05 0590  7    traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see,
G05 0600  4    is that these places and activities are often the settings
G05 0610  1    in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic
G05 0610  8    sensibilities. Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the
G05 0620  7    human form- these things are important to Persians,
G05 0630  5    and they experience them with an intense and discriminating
G05 0640  3    awareness.
G05 0640  4       I should like, by the way, to make it clear that
G05 0650  4    I am not using the word "Persians" carelessly. I don't
G05 0660  3    mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations,
G05 0660 12    like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand
G05 0670 10    in a pool. These things are important to almost all
G05 0680  6    Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary.
G05 0690  4    The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's
G05 0700  1    night are as often as not the lutihaw, mustachioed
G05 0700 10    toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of
G05 0710 11    the local prisons, brothels, and teahouses. A few months
G05 0720  6    ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead
G05 0730  5    of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from
G05 0730 15    a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity
G05 0740  8    and flavor. Not long ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed
G05 0750  7    water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city, stood
G05 0760  5    on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.
G05 0770  1    The air, he said, was just right; a cigarette would
G05 0770 11    taste particularly good. I really didn't know what
G05 0780  7    he meant. It was a nice day, granted. But he knew;
G05 0790  5    he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew
G05 0800  4    as a vintner knows a vintage.
G05 0800 10       The natural world then, plus poetry and some kinds
G05 0810  7    of art, receives from the most ordinary of Persians
G05 0820  3    a great deal of attention. The line of an eyebrow,
G05 0830  1    the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity
G05 0830 12    of spring water, the long afternoon among the boughs
G05 0840  7    which crowd the upper story of a pavilion- these things
G05 0850  5    are noticed, judged, and valued.
G05 0850 10       Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of
G05 0860  9    the Persians shown so well as during the promenade
G05 0870  6    at the Khaju bridge. There has probably always been
G05 0880  3    a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of
G05 0880 13    the city. For one thing, there is a natural belt of
G05 0890 11    rock across the river bed; for another, it was here
G05 0900  7    that one of the old caravan routes came in. It was
G05 0910  4    to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans,
G05 0920  1    and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah
G05 0920 12    Abbas II in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick,
G05 0930  9    tile, and stone, the present bridge. It is a splendid
G05 0940  6    structure. From upstream it looks like a long arcaded
G05 0950  3    box laid across the river; from downstream, where the
G05 0960  1    water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately
G05 0960 11    facaded pavilion.
G05 0970  1       The top story contains more than thirty alcoves
G05 0970  9    separated from each other by spandrels of blue and
G05 0980  8    yellow tile. At either end and in the center there
G05 0990  5    are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed
G05 1000  1    and capacious as church apses. Here, in the old days-
G05 1000 11    when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks-
G05 1010 11    sat the king and his court while priests, soldiers,
G05 1020  6    and other members of the party lounged in the smaller
G05 1030  4    alcoves between.
G05 1030  6       Below, twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure
G05 1040  4    of the bridge. These are traversed by another line
G05 1050  3    of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides,
G05 1050 13    are formed. Down through the axis of the bridge there
G05 1060 10    is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers
G05 1070  8    and arches, while the vaults fronting upstream and
G05 1080  3    down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and
G05 1090  1    river pools. Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath
G05 1090 12    the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices
G05 1100 10    at the bottom of the vaults.
G05 1110  2       On the downstream, or "pavilion", side these vaults
G05 1120  1    give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge
G05 1120 11    itself. From the terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights
G05 1130  6    of steps descend into the water or onto still more
G05 1140  6    terraces barely above the level of the river. Out of
G05 1150  3    water, brick, and tile they have made far more than
G05 1150 13    just a bridge.
G05 1160  2       On spring and summer evenings people leave their
G05 1160 10    shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the
G05 1170 11    city to the bridge. It is a great spectacle. The bridge
G05 1180  7    itself rises up from the river, light-flared and enormous,
G05 1190  3    like the outdoor set for an epic opera. Crowds press
G05 1200  2    along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the
G05 1200 13    arcades, massing against it as though it were a fortress
G05 1210 10    under siege. All kinds come to walk in the promenade:
G05 1220  7    merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal; a
G05 1230  5    Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes
G05 1240  1    who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes
G05 1240 11    filmed with rheum and visions; the old Kajar princes
G05 1250  8    arriving in their ancient limousines; students, civil
G05 1260  4    servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers, and clowns.
G05 1270  3    Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit
G05 1270 14    on carpets around a samovar. Below, people line the
G05 1280  9    steps, as though on bleachers, to watch the sky and
G05 1290  7    river. Above, in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves,
G05 1300  4    boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at
G05 1310  1    the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades
G05 1310 11    of the city hoot and bang their drums, drink arak,
G05 1320  7    play dice, and dance.
G05 1320 11       Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things
G05 1330 10    which are important to them: poetry, water, the moon,
G05 1340  7    a beautiful face. To a stranger their delight in these
G05 1350  5    things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase the
G05 1360  2    golden calf as much as any people. Many of them, moreover,
G05 1360 13    are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western
G05 1370  9    amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar
G05 1380  8    merchant, the mullah, and the peasant. Nonetheless,
G05 1390  2    they take time out- much time- from the game of grab
G05 1400  2    and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens
G05 1400 12    and riverbanks. Above all, they will stop in the middle
G05 1410  9    of anything, anywhere, to hear or quote some poetry.
G05 1420  7       Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common
G05 1430  5    ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms-
G05 1440  1    all may stand. It contains, in fact, their whole outlook
G05 1450  1    on life. And it is expressed, at least to their taste,
G05 1450 12    in a perfect form. Poetry for a Persian is nothing
G05 1460  8    less than truth and beauty. In most Western cultures
G05 1470  5    today these twins have been sent away to the libraries
G05 1480  2    and museums. In Persia, where practically speaking
G05 1480  9    there are no museums or libraries or, for that matter,
G05 1490 10    hardly any books, the twins run free.
G05 1500  4       It is perhaps difficult to conceive, but imagine
G05 1510  1    that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the
G05 1510 11    East End will gather to sing Marlowe, Herrick, Shakespeare,
G05 1520  8    and perhaps some lyrics of their own. That, at any
G05 1530  8    rate, is what happens at the Khaju bridge. Boys and
G05 1540  4    men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the
G05 1550  1    top arcade. Here in these little rooms- or stages arched
G05 1550 11    open to the sky and river- they choose a few lines
G05 1560 10    out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according
G05 1570  7    to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided.
G05 1580  4    Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute-
G05 1590  3    one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another
G05 1590  9    love, and so on, to include all of the emotions. The
G05 1600  9    singer simply matches the poem to a mode; for example,
G05 1610  6    the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem: "They
G05 1620  3    brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's
G05 1630  2    blood the crimson tulip stains; Go, tell his aged mother
G05 1640  1    that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was
G05 1640 12    one". Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent
G05 1650 12    poet: "Know ye, fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall
G05 1660 10    hereafter come to birth, That here, with dust upon
G05 1670  5    his eyes, Iraj, the sweet-tongued singer, lies. In
G05 1680  2    this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies
G05 1680 12    sepulchred ...".
G05 1690  2       These songs (practically all Persian music, for
G05 1700  1    that matter) are limited to a range of two octaves.
G05 1700 11    Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing
G05 1710  6    variety: design as intricate as that in the carpet
G05 1720  5    or miniature, with the melodic line like the painted
G05 1730  1    or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.
