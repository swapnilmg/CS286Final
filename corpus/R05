R05 0010  1    #AMBIGUITY#
R05 0010  2    Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the
R05 0020  1    ambiguous use of words, unless it be the ambiguous
R05 0020 10    use of sentences. Ben Franklin said, "Clearly spoken,
R05 0030  6    Mr. Fogg. You explain English by Greek". Richard Brinsley
R05 0040  5    Sheridan said, "I think the interpreter is the hardest
R05 0050  5    to be understood of the two". And a witty American
R05 0060  2    journalist remarked over a century ago what is even
R05 0060 11    more true today, "Many a writer seems to think he is
R05 0070 11    never profound except when he can't understand his
R05 0080  6    own meaning".
R05 0080  8       There are many types of ambiguity and many of them
R05 0090  8    have been described by rhetoricians under such names
R05 0100  4    as amphibology, parisology, and other ologies. In common
R05 0110  3    parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters,
R05 0120  1    misunderstanders, misdirectors and kindred misdeeds.
R05 0120  6       One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving
R05 0130  8    repetition. "Did you or did you not say what I said
R05 0140 10    you said, because Jane said you never said what I said"?
R05 0150  6       Another woman, addressing Christmas cards, said
R05 0160  3    to her husband: "We sent them one last year but they
R05 0170  2    didn't send us one, so they probably won't send us
R05 0170 12    one this year because they'll think we won't send them
R05 0180  9    one because they didn't last year, don't you think,
R05 0190  6    or shall we"?
R05 0190  9       Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making
R05 0200  6    it worse compounded, and they are sometimes expanded
R05 0210  5    until the cream of the jest sours. Ambiguity of a non-repetitious
R05 0220  5    kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in.
R05 0230  2    "I'm terribly upset", she told a girl-friend. "I wrote
R05 0240  1    Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him
R05 0240 13    that I didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to
R05 0250  8    change my mind- and he seems to have misunderstood
R05 0260  5    me". Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply
R05 0270  4    don't understand women.
R05 0270  7       Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped
R05 0280  6    up a politician. "Mr. Jones, you may recall that we
R05 0290  6    printed last week your denial of having retracted the
R05 0300  2    contradiction of your original statement. Now would
R05 0300  9    you care to have us say that you were misquoted in
R05 0310 10    regard to it"?
R05 0320  1       Questions like this, framed in verbal fog, are perhaps
R05 0320  9    the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced
R05 0330  6    politician. They recall Byron's classic comment: "I
R05 0340  4    wish he would explain his explanation". Similarly,
R05 0350  2    when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic
R05 0350 10    fashion, Lincoln refused to make any further statement.
R05 0360  8    "I fear explanations explanatory of things explained",
R05 0370  5    he said, leaving the biter bit- and bitter.
R05 0380  5       The obscurity of politicians may not always be as
R05 0390  2    innocent as it looks. "Senator", said an interviewer,
R05 0390 10    "your constituents can't understand from your speech
R05 0400  7    last night just how you stand on the question". "Good"!
R05 0410  7    replied the Senator. "It took me five hours to write
R05 0420  7    it that way".
R05 0420 10       The misplaced modifier is another species more honored
R05 0430  7    in the observance of obscurity than in the breach.
R05 0440  5    This creates an amusing effect because its position
R05 0450  2    in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word.
R05 0450 14    A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain:
R05 0460  8    "I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree.
R05 0480  8    Now can you tell me who was drunk- The man, his wife,
R05 0490  5    or me"?
R05 0490  7       The "wooden-leg" gag of vaudeville, another standby
R05 0500  6    of this sort, had endless variations.
R05 0510  1       ""There's a man outside with a wooden leg named
R05 0510 10    Smith". "What's the name of his other leg""?
R05 0520  8       Another stock vaudeville gag ran: "Mother is home
R05 0530  8    sick in bed with the doctor".
R05 0540  2       When radio came in, it continued the misplaced modifier
R05 0550  1    in its routines as a standard device.
R05 0550  8       ""Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the
R05 0560  7    car with slacks on"? "I see the girl but I don't see
R05 0570  7    the car with slacks on"".
R05 0570 12       In recent years gagwriters have discovered this
R05 0580  7    brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has
R05 0590  5    acquired a new habitat in the gagline. In one cartoon
R05 0600  4    a family is shown outside a theater with the head of
R05 0600 15    the family addressing the doorman: "Excuse me, but
R05 0610  8    when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's
R05 0620  9    handbag and my wife's behind".
R05 0630  1       Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such
R05 0630 10    slips. Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking
R05 0640  9    part in a contest that "snapshots must be of a person
R05 0650  8    not larger than **f inches".
R05 0660  1       Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated
R05 0660  8    constructions. Readers of the Reader's Digest are familiar
R05 0670  8    with such items which often appear in its lists of
R05 0680  9    verbal slips, like the ad in a California paper that
R05 0690  5    advertised "House for rent. View takes in five counties,
R05 0700  3    two bedrooms".
R05 0700  5       Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as
R05 0710  5    wit, newspaper headlines continually provide us with
R05 0720  3    amusing samples. "Officials Meet on Rubbish. Many Shapes
R05 0730  1    in Bathtubs. Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married".
R05 0730 10       Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese, journalism
R05 0740  8    contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in
R05 0750  8    both editorial and advertising matter.
R05 0760  2       A weekly newspaper reported a local romance: "...
R05 0770  2    and the couple were married last Saturday, thus ending
R05 0770 11    a friendship which began in their schooldays".
R05 0780  6       An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed
R05 0790  6    a subscription, adding: "I personally enjoy your newspaper
R05 0800  4    as much as my husband".
R05 0800  9       Then there was the caterer's ad which read: "ARE
R05 0810  8    YOU GETTING MARRIED OR HAVING AN AFFAIR? We have complete
R05 0820  8    facilities to accommodate 200 people".
R05 0830  3       The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the
R05 0840  1    anatomical. This slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous
R05 0850  1    English always seems to refer to a person's anatomy
R05 0850 10    but never quite means what it seems to say. Samples:
R05 0860  8    He walked in upon her invitation. She kissed him passionately
R05 0870  5    upon his reappearance. He kissed her back.
R05 0880  2       Not without good reason has the anatomical been
R05 0880 10    called jocular journalese. In news items a man is less
R05 0890 10    often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs.
R05 0900  7    "While Henry Morgan was escorting Miss Vera Green from
R05 0910  5    the church social last Saturday night, a savage dog
R05 0920  2    attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square".
R05 0930  1       Such items recall the California journalist who
R05 0930  8    reported an accident involving a movie star: "The area
R05 0940  8    in which Miss N- was injured is spectacularly scenic".
R05 0950  5       The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar
R05 0960  6    vaudeville device, as in the gags of Weber and Fields.
R05 0970  4    When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked
R05 0980  2    in the ensuing rumpus, he replied, "No, it was in the
R05 0980 13    stomach". Strangely enough, this always brought the
R05 0990  7    house down.
R05 0990  9       Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags, the anatomical
R05 1000  8    is also found in jocular literature. A conscientious
R05 1010  6    girl became the secretary of a doctor. Her first day
R05 1020  6    at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's
R05 1030  1    notes on an emergency case. It read: "Shot in the lumbar
R05 1040  1    region". After a moment of thought, her mind cleared
R05 1040 10    and, in the interest of clarity, she typed into the
R05 1050  8    record: "Shot in the woods".
R05 1060  1       There are many grammatical misconstructions other
R05 1060  7    than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit
R05 1070  6    two different interpretations. At the home of a gourmet
R05 1080  7    the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving.
R05 1090  4    "I want the fish served whole, with head and tail",
R05 1100  2    the epicure explained, "and serve it with lemon in
R05 1100 11    mouth". The maid demurred. "That's silly- lemon in
R05 1110  8    mouth", she said. But since the gourmet insisted that
R05 1120  7    it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners,
R05 1130  3    the girl reluctantly agreed. So she brought the fish
R05 1140  2    in whole, and she carried a lemon in her mouth.
R05 1140 12       Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated
R05 1150  8    by a woman in a department store. She said to the saleslady,
R05 1160  7    "I want a dress to put on around the house". The puzzled
R05 1170  6    saleslady inquired, "How large is your house, Madam"?
R05 1180  4       This saleslady was a failure in the dress department
R05 1190  3    and was transferred to the shoe department. When a
R05 1200  1    customer asked for alligator shoes, she said, "What
R05 1200  9    size is your alligator"?
R05 1210  1       The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class
R05 1220  2    of comedy. One species is restricted to statements
R05 1220 10    which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a
R05 1230  6    particular person, place, time or thing. A woman met
R05 1240  6    a famous author at a literary tea. "Oh, I'm so delighted
R05 1250  3    to meet you", she gushed. "It was only the other day
R05 1260  2    that I saw something of yours, about something or other,
R05 1260 12    in some magazine".
R05 1270  2       This baffling lack of distinct details recalls the
R05 1280  1    secretary whose employer was leaving the office and
R05 1280  9    told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence.
R05 1290  8    "I may be back", he explained, "and then again, I may
R05 1300  6    not". The girl nodded understandingly. "Yes, sir",
R05 1310  3    she said, "is that definite"?
R05 1310  8       An old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter,
R05 1320  7    "You must have gotten in quite late last night, dear.
R05 1330  7    Where were you"? The daughter replied, "Oh, I had dinner
R05 1340  5    with- well, you don't know him but he's awfully nice-
R05 1350  3    and we went to a couple of places- I don't suppose
R05 1360  2    you've heard of them- and we finished up at a cute
R05 1360 13    little night club- I forget the name of it. Why, it's
R05 1370 11    all right, isn't it, Mother"? Her woolly-minded parent
R05 1380  7    agreed. "Of course, dear", she said. "It's only that
R05 1390  6    I like to know where you go".
R05 1400  1       No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain
R05 1400 10    clergyman's sermon. "Dearly beloved", he preached,
R05 1410  6    "unless you repent of your sins in a measure, and become
R05 1420  8    converted to a degree, you will, I regret to say, be
R05 1430  6    damned to a more or less extent". This clergyman should
R05 1440  2    have referred to Shakespeare's dictum: "So-so is a
R05 1440 11    good, very good, very excellent maxim. And yet it is
R05 1450 10    not. It is but so-so".
R05 1460  1       Indefinite reference also carries double-meaning
R05 1470  1    where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer
R05 1470 12    to another. A news item described the launching of
R05 1480  7    a ship: "Completing the ceremony, the beautiful movie
R05 1490  4    star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as
R05 1500  3    she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea".
R05 1500 12       This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant
R05 1510 10    of an army motor pool: "Four trucks to Fort Mason gym,
R05 1520  8    7:30 tonight, for hauling girls to dance. The bodies
R05 1530  6    must be cleaned and seats wiped off".
R05 1540  1       A politician was approached by a man seeking the
R05 1540 10    office of a minor public official who had just died.
R05 1550  8    "What are my chances for taking Joe's place"? he asked.
R05 1560  5    "If you can fix it up with the undertaker", returned
R05 1570  3    the politician, "it's all right with me".
R05 1580  1       The manager of a movie theater received a telephone
R05 1580 10    call from a woman who was equally indefinite. "What
R05 1590  8    have you got on today"? she inquired. "A blue suit",
R05 1600  6    he answered. "Who's in it"? she continued. "I am",
R05 1610  5    he said. There was a short pause for reflection. "Oh",
R05 1620  3    said the woman, "I've seen that picture already".
R05 1630  1       Another brand of indefinite reference arises out
R05 1630  8    of the use of the double verb. When a question contains
R05 1640 11    two verbs, the response does not make clear which of
R05 1650  8    them is being answered.
R05 1660  1       The moonlit night was made for romance, and he had
R05 1660 11    been looking at her soulfully for some time. Finally
R05 1670  7    he asked, "Do you object to petting"? "That's one thing
R05 1680  4    I've never done", she said promptly. He thought a moment,
R05 1690  5    then inquired, "You mean petted"? "No", she smiled,
R05 1700  4    "objected".
R05 1700  5       Replies to requests for character reference are
R05 1710  4    notorious for their evasive double-entendre. It would
R05 1720  3    be hard to find anything more equivocal than: "I cannot
R05 1730  1    recommend him too highly".
R05 1730  5       Another less ambiguous case read as follows: "The
R05 1740  4    bearer of this letter has served me for two years to
R05 1750  2    his complete satisfaction. If you are thinking of giving
R05 1750 11    him a berth, be sure to make it a wide one".
R05 1760 10       In the comedy of indefinite reference, it-wit occupies
R05 1770  5    a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence.
R05 1780  3    Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold
R05 1790  3    reference.
R05 1790  4       Two friends were talking. One said, "When I get
R05 1800  3    a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it, and within
R05 1800 15    a few hours it's gone". The speaker referred to the
R05 1810 10    whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold.
R05 1820  7       It-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as
R05 1830  5    well as wit. An excited woman was making an emergency
R05 1840  1    call over the phone: "Doctor, please come over right
R05 1840 10    away. My husband is in great pain.
