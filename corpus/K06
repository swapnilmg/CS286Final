K06 0010  1    With a sneer, the man spread his legs and, a third
K06 0010 12    time, confronted them.
K06 0020  1       Once more, Katie reared, and whinnied in fear. For
K06 0020 10    a moment, boy and mount hung in midair. Stevie twisted
K06 0030  9    and, frantically, commanded the mare to leap straight
K06 0040  7    ahead. But the stranger was nimbler still. With a bold
K06 0050  5    arm, he dared once more to obstruct them. Katie reared
K06 0060  2    a third time, then, trembling, descended.
K06 0060  8       The stranger leered. Seizing the bridle, he tugged
K06 0070  7    with all his might and forced Katie to her knees. It
K06 0080  6    was absurd. Stevie could feel himself toppling. He
K06 0090  2    saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head.
K06 0090 11    With incredible ferocity, he brought his fists together
K06 0100  8    and struck. The blow encountered silky hair and hard
K06 0110  6    bone. The man uttered a weird cry, spun about, and
K06 0120  4    collapsed in the sand.
K06 0120  8       Katie scrambled to her feet, Stevie agilely retaining
K06 0130  5    his seat. Again Katie reared, and now, wickedly, he
K06 0140  3    compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again
K06 0150  1    upon the sprawled figure of the stranger. He could
K06 0150 10    feel his own feet, iron-shod, striking repeatedly until
K06 0160  6    the body was limp. He gloated, and his lips slavered.
K06 0170  5    He heard himself chortling.
K06 0170  9       They rode around and around to trample the figure
K06 0180  8    into the sand. Only the top of the head, with a spot
K06 0190  7    bare and white as a clamshell, remained visible. Stevie
K06 0200  2    was shouting triumphantly.
K06 0200  5       A train hooted. Instantly, he chilled. They were
K06 0210  5    pursuing him. He was frightened; his fists clutched
K06 0220  2    so tightly that his knuckles hurt. Then Katie stumbled,
K06 0230  1    and again he was falling, falling!
K06 0230  7       "Stevie! Stevie"!
K06 0240  1       His mother was nudging him, but he was still falling.
K06 0240 11    His head hung over the boards of Katie's stall; before
K06 0250  8    it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger.
K06 0260  7       "Stevie, wake up now! We're nearly there".
K06 0270  4       He had been dreaming. He was safe in his Mama's
K06 0280  4    arms.
K06 0280  5       The train had slowed. Houses winked as the cars
K06 0290  4    rolled beside a little depot. "Po' Chavis"! the trainman
K06 0300  1    called. He came by and repeated, "Po' Chavis"!
K06 0300  9    #CHAPTER 6#
K06 0310  2    Bong! Bong! startled him awake. The room vibrated as
K06 0320  1    if a giant hand had rocked it. Bong! a dull boom and
K06 0320 13    a throbbing echo. The walls bulged, the floor trembled,
K06 0330  8    the windowpanes rattled. He stared at the far morning,
K06 0340  7    expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon. Bong!
K06 0350  3    He raced to the window and yanked at the sash. Bong!
K06 0360  2    the wood was old, the paint alligatored. Bong! A fresh
K06 0370  2    breeze saluted him. Six o'clock!
K06 0370  7       He put his his head out. There was the slate roof
K06 0380  8    of the church; ivy climbed the red brick walls like
K06 0390  5    a green-scaled monster. The clock which had struck
K06 0400  1    presented an innocent face.
K06 0400  5       In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards.
K06 0410  3       "There's a tower and a steeple on the church a million
K06 0420  3    feet high. And the loudest clock in the whole world"!
K06 0430  1       "I know, Stephen", she smiled. "They say that our
K06 0440  1    steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high. The
K06 0440 11    clock you heard strike- it's really the town clock-
K06 0450  8    was installed last April by Mrs. Shorter, on her birthday".
K06 0460  6       He dressed, and sped outdoors. He crossed Broome
K06 0470  4    Street to Orange Square. The steeple leaned backward,
K06 0480  2    while the church advanced like a headless creature
K06 0480 10    in a long, shapeless coat. The spire seemed to hold
K06 0490  9    up the sky.
K06 0490 12       Port Jervis, basking in the foothills, was the city
K06 0500  9    of God. The Dutch Reformed Church, with two steeples
K06 0510  6    and its own school was on Main Street; the Episcopal
K06 0520  4    Church was one block down Sussex Street; the Catholic
K06 0530  3    Saint Mary's Church, with an even taller steeple and
K06 0540  2    a cross on top, stood on Ball Street. The Catholics
K06 0540 12    had the largest cemetery, near the Neversink River
K06 0550  7    where Main Street ran south; Stevie whistled when he
K06 0560  5    passed these alien grounds.
K06 0560  9       God was everywhere, in the belfry, in the steeple,
K06 0570  9    in the clouds, in the trees, and in the mountains hulking
K06 0580  7    on the horizon. Somewhere, beyond, where shadows lurked,
K06 0590  4    must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and
K06 0600  2    the dreadful Lake of Fire.
K06 0600  7       So, walking in awe, he became familiar with God,
K06 0610  4    who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church with
K06 0620  2    its high steeple and clock. There was no church like
K06 0620 12    Drew Church, no preacher like Papa, who was intimate
K06 0630  8    with Him, and could consign sinners to hellfire. To
K06 0640  5    know God he must follow in Papa's footsteps. He was
K06 0650  4    fortunate, and proud.
K06 0650  7       The veterans, idling on their benches in the Square,
K06 0660  7    beneath the soldiers' monument, got to their feet when
K06 0670  4    Papa approached: "Morning, Reverend"! His being and
K06 0680  3    His will- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa-
K06 0690  3    illumined every parish face, turned the choir into
K06 0690 11    a band of angels, and the pulpit into the tollgate
K06 0700  7    to Heaven.
K06 0700  9       "We have nine hundred and eleven members in our
K06 0710  7    charge", Mama announced, "and three hundred and eighty
K06 0720  4    Sunday-school scholars".
K06 0720  7       When Papa went out to do God's work, Stevie often
K06 0730  9    accompanied him in the buggy, which was drawn by Violet,
K06 0740  6    the new black mare. Although they journeyed westerly
K06 0750  2    as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and
K06 0760  1    the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson
K06 0760 10    Canal, and northward to Brooklyn, below Point Peter,
K06 0770  6    he could see the church spire wherever he looked back.
K06 0780  5    Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse-
K06 0790  3    "Afternoon, Reverend"!- and crossed the suspension
K06 0800  1    bridge to Matamoras; that was Pennsylvania.
K06 0800  7       In the Delaware River, three long islands were overgrown
K06 0810  8    with greening trees and underbrush. South of Laurel
K06 0820  6    Grove Cemetery, and below the junction of the Neversink
K06 0830  5    and the Delaware, was the Tri-State Rock, from which
K06 0840  3    Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well
K06 0850  1    as New York, simply by spinning around on his heel.
K06 0850 11       On these excursions, Papa instructed him on man's
K06 0860  7    chief end, which was his duty to God and his own salvation.
K06 0870  8    However, a boy's lively eyes might rove. Where Cuddleback
K06 0880  4    Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming
K06 0890  2    hole. Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing
K06 0900  1    youth: "Idle recreation"! Stevie saw no idols; it troubled
K06 0910  1    him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw. He was
K06 0910 12    torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters
K06 0920  8    and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello
K06 0930  5    Branch.
K06 0930  6       "Where you been today"? Ludie inquired every evening,
K06 0940  6    pretending that he did not care. "He'll make a preacher
K06 0950  6    out of you"!
K06 0950  9       "No, he won't"! Stevie flared. "Not me"!
K06 0960  6       "Somebody's got to be a preacher in the family.
K06 0970  9    He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson.
K06 0980  5    I heard them! Uncle and Aunt Howe were the witnesses".
K06 0990  3       "Will he die"?
K06 0990  6       "Everybody does".
K06 1000  2       Ludie could be hateful. To speak of Papa dying was
K06 1010  1    a sin. It could never happen as long as God was alert
K06 1010 13    and the Drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance.
K06 1020  8       Stevie was constantly slipping into the church.
K06 1030  5    He pulled with all his strength at the heavy, brass-bound
K06 1040  4    door, and shuffled along the wainscoted wall. The cold,
K06 1050  2    mysterious presence of God was all around him. At the
K06 1050 12    end of a shaft of light, the pews appeared to be broad
K06 1060 10    stairs in a long dungeon. Far away, standing before
K06 1070  5    a curtained window in the study room, was his father,
K06 1080  3    hands tucked under his coattails, and staring into
K06 1080 11    the dark church. The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary
K06 1090  9    luminescence.
K06 1100  1       The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance
K06 1100  9    with its wrinkles and gray hair. Would Papa really
K06 1110  7    die? The mouth was thin-lipped and wide, the long cleft
K06 1120  6    in the upper lip like a slide. When Papa's slender
K06 1130  2    fingers removed the spectacles, there were red indentations
K06 1140  1    on the bridge of the strong nose.
K06 1140  8       "It's time you began to think on God, Stephen. Perhaps
K06 1150  7    one day He will choose you as He chose me, long ago.
K06 1160  6    Therefore, give Him your affection and store up His
K06 1170  3    love for you. Open your heart to Him and pray, Stephen,
K06 1170 14    pray! For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from
K06 1180 11    evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire".
K06 1190  7       Stevie had heard these words many times, yet on
K06 1200  6    each occasion they caused him to tremble. For he feared
K06 1210  4    the Lake of Fire. He strove to think of God and His
K06 1220  1    eternal wrath; he must pray to be spared.
K06 1220  9       Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers
K06 1230  6    had heard the Call. Not George, Townley, or Ted, certainly
K06 1240  4    not Ludie. Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany
K06 1250  4    Law School, where they surely could not hear it. Someday
K06 1260  1    God would choose him. He would hear the Call and would
K06 1260 12    run to tell Papa. The stern face would relax, the black-clad
K06 1270 12    arms would embrace him, "My son"! Yet how might he
K06 1280  9    know the Call when it came? Probably, as in Scriptures,
K06 1290  7    a still, small voice would whisper. It would summon
K06 1300  4    him once; if he missed it, never again. What if it
K06 1310  3    came when he was playing, or was asleep and dreaming?
K06 1320  1       He must not fail to hear it. He was Papa's chosen;
K06 1320 12    therefore, nothing but good could happen to him, even
K06 1330  9    in God's wrathful storms. When the skies grew dark
K06 1340  6    and thunder rolled across the valley, he was unafraid.
K06 1350  3    Aggie might fly into a closet, shut the door and bury
K06 1350 14    her head in the clothes; he dared to wait for the lightning.
K06 1370  1       Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner!
K06 1370 10    But he was good. He clenched his fists and faced the
K06 1380  8    terror. Thunder crashed; barrels tumbled down the mountainsides,
K06 1390  6    and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them
K06 1400  5    open. Lightning might strike the steeples of the other
K06 1410  3    churches; not of Drew Church. A flash illumined the
K06 1410 12    trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions.
K06 1420  9    Violet whinnied from the stable.
K06 1430  4       He ran out into the downpour, sped across the yard
K06 1440  2    and into the buggy room. "Don't be afraid, Violet"!
K06 1440 11    he shouted, and was aghast at the echoes. "Don't you
K06 1450 10    be afraid"! He would save her. If there was a fire
K06 1460 10    or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next.
K06 1470  5    Drenched and shaking, he stood near the sweet-smelling
K06 1480  1    stall and dared to pat her muzzle. "Don't you be afraid,
K06 1490  1    Violet"!
K06 1490  2       After the storm, the sky cleared blue and cool,
K06 1500  1    and fragrant air swept the hills. When the sun came
K06 1500 11    out, Stevie strode proudly into Orange Square, smiling
K06 1510  7    like a landlord on industrious tenants. The fountain
K06 1520  4    had brimmed over, the cannon were wet, the soldiers'
K06 1530  2    monument glistened. Even before the benches had dried,
K06 1540  1    the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their
K06 1540 10    places. The great spire shone as if the lightning had
K06 1550  8    polished it. He jumped. The pointed shadow had nearly
K06 1560  5    touched him.
K06 1560  7       He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot
K06 1570  6    on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed.
K06 1580  1       "Go on home"! Ludie screeched at him. "Someone'll
K06 1590  1    tell Papa"!
K06 1590  3       No one told on Ludie, not even when he slipped live
K06 1600  3    grasshoppers into the mite-box. Ludie did as he pleased.
K06 1610  1       Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop
K06 1610 10    to shoot at crows. Ludie chewed roofer's tar. Ludie
K06 1620  7    had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters, and a
K06 1630  6    Roman candle from last Fourth of July. Ludie hopped
K06 1640  3    rides on freight cars, and was chased by Mr. Yankton,
K06 1650  1    the railroad guard. He came home overheated, ran straight
K06 1650 10    to the ice-chest, and gulped shivery cold water.
K06 1660  6       Stevie envied him. That Ludie! He, too, cocked his
K06 1670  6    cap at a jaunty angle, jingled marbles in his pocket,
K06 1680  4    and swaggered down Main Street. On the Christophers'
K06 1690  1    lawn, little girls in white pinafores were playing
K06 1690  9    grownups at a tea party. A Newfoundland sat solemnly
K06 1700  8    beside a doghouse half his size. Stevie yearned for
K06 1710  5    a dog. He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky.
K06 1720  3       He meandered down Pike Street, past the First National
K06 1730  1    Bank with its green window shades. He crossed the tracks
K06 1730 11    to Delaware House, where ladies in gay dresses and
K06 1740  9    men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the
K06 1750  6    verandah. A tall lady, with a ruffled collar very low
K06 1760  4    on her bosom, turned insolent green eyes upon him.
K06 1760 13    She was taller than Aggie. She was so beautiful with
K06 1770 10    her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked.
K06 1780 10    Fiddles screeched; a piano tinkled.
K06 1790  2       "P. J."- as Ludie called the town- was crowded with
K06 1800  3    summer people who came to the mountains to escape the
K06 1810  1    heat in the big cities. They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses,
K06 1810 12    or at private homes. Rich people went to Delaware House,
K06 1820 10    Opera House, American House or Fowler House.
