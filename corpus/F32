F32 0010  1    Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by
F32 0010 10    Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet
F32 0020  7    Letter as one of those who came into the old custom
F32 0030  6    house to do business with him as the surveyor of the
F32 0040  3    port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr. Upton possessed
F32 0050  1    intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a
F32 0050  9    devoted Christian. The daughter profited from his interest
F32 0060  7    in scientific and philosophical subjects. Her mother
F32 0070  4    also was a person of superior mind and broad interests.
F32 0080  2       There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood
F32 0090  1    had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye,
F32 0090 10    a retentive memory, and a critical faculty. When she
F32 0100  7    was nine years old, she wrote a description of a store
F32 0110  6    she had visited. She named 48 items, and said there
F32 0120  2    were "many more things which it would take too long
F32 0120 12    to write". An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years
F32 0130  9    of age quoted the Declaration of Independence, the
F32 0140  5    freedom given to slaves in Canada, and the views of
F32 0150  5    George Washington.
F32 0150  7       Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School
F32 0160  6    when few colleges, only Oberlin and Elmira, were open
F32 0170  4    to women; and she had an appetite for learning that
F32 0180  2    could not be denied.
F32 0180  6       A picture of her in high school comes from a younger
F32 0190  4    schoolmate, Albert S. Flint, friend of her brother
F32 0200  1    Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer.
F32 0200  9    He recalled Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young
F32 0210  9    lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall
F32 0220  6    to join the class in Greek in the little recitation
F32 0230  2    room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive
F32 0240  1    mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton
F32 0240 12    too expected to go to college and take the full classical
F32 0250 10    course offered to men. The death of her mother in 1865
F32 0260  8    prevented this. With four younger children at home,
F32 0270  4    Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after
F32 0280  1    the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's
F32 0280 11    comfort and stay until he died in 1879. But even so
F32 0290 11    Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits. When
F32 0300  5    her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University
F32 0310  4    in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history he
F32 0320  2    was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof. Diman's
F32 0330  1    definition of civilization, and take the world through,
F32 0330  9    is its progress ever onward, or does it retrograde
F32 0340  7    at times? Do you think I might profitably study some
F32 0350  5    of the history you do, perhaps two weeks behind you
F32 0360  3    ...". And that she proceeded to do.
F32 0360 10       Many years later (on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton
F32 0370  7    wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from
F32 0380  5    Smith College: "While I love botany which, after dabbling
F32 0390  3    in for years, I studied according to the methods of
F32 0400  2    that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school,
F32 0400 12    it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way
F32 0410  8    you are doing. Whatever was the science in the high
F32 0420  5    school course for the time being, that was my favorite
F32 0430  1    study. Mathematics came next".
F32 0430  5       Her study of history was persistently pursued. She
F32 0440  5    read Maitland's Dark Ages, "which I enjoyed very much";
F32 0450  5    La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages; 16 chapters
F32 0460  4    of Bryce "and liked it more and more"; more chapters
F32 0470  3    of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church. She
F32 0480  2    discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions
F32 0490  1    that came to her as she studied alone.
F32 0490  9       Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during
F32 0500  5    his college days was not entirely taken up with academic
F32 0510  4    studies. She played chess with him by postcard. Also
F32 0520  2    Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which
F32 0520 12    one could make the most words from the letters in
F32 0530  9    "importunately".
F32 0530 10    Who won is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor
F32 0540  8    says they got up to 1,212 words.
F32 0550  3       There was another family interest also. Winslow
F32 0560  1    had musical talents, as had his father before him.
F32 0560 10    At different times he served as glee-club and choir
F32 0570  8    leader and as organist. And it was Lucy Upton who first
F32 0580  5    started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman
F32 0590  3    College.
F32 0590  4       Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University
F32 0600  2    and two years of graduate study, accepted a position
F32 0610  1    at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was
F32 0610 10    connected with the U.S. Naval Observatory and with
F32 0620  7    the U.S. Signal Corps; and after 1883, was professor
F32 0630  6    of astronomy at Brown University. The six expeditions
F32 0640  4    to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was a member,
F32 0650  3    took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well
F32 0650 12    as to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's
F32 0660 11    death, Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few
F32 0670  9    years with Winslow in Washington, D.C. "Their house",
F32 0680  4    writes Albert S. Flint, "was always a haven of hospitality
F32 0690  7    and good cheer, especially grateful to one like myself
F32 0700  5    far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the household.
F32 0710  2    Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor.
F32 0710 11    Winslow, as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall,
F32 0720  8    used to characterize her as "our iron sister". There
F32 0730  7    is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record
F32 0740  6    as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not
F32 0750  4    been that her mother's death occurred just as she was
F32 0750 14    about to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert
F32 0760 10    S. Flint expressed his conviction that "her physical
F32 0770  6    strength, her mental power, her lively interest in
F32 0780  4    all objects about her and her readiness to serve her
F32 0790  2    fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished
F32 0790 11    career amongst the noted women of this country".
F32 0800  8       While in Washington, D.C., Lucy Upton held positions
F32 0810  6    in the U.S. Census Office, and in the Pension Bureau.
F32 0820  7    They were not sufficiently challenging however, and
F32 0830  3    she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her brother
F32 0840  2    Winslow and his family while he was there on study.
F32 0840 12    After the months in Europe, she returned to Boston
F32 0850  8    and became active in church and community life.
F32 0860  4       What was called an "accidental meeting" with Miss
F32 0870  3    Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.
F32 0880  1    Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence
F32 0880 10    with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and
F32 0890 10    Miss Giles, she came to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888,
F32 0900  8    to help wherever needed, although there was then no
F32 0910  5    money available to pay her a salary. She served for
F32 0920  1    a number of years without pay beyond her travel and
F32 0920 11    maintenance.
F32 0930  1       Her students have spoken of the exacting standards
F32 0930  9    of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected
F32 0940  8    and achieved from the students; of her "great power
F32 0950  5    of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness of dress", "her
F32 0960  4    well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts
F32 0970  1    of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants
F32 0970 11    and birds; and her close knowledge of individual students.
F32 0980  8       She drew on all her resources of mind and heart
F32 0990  9    to help them- to make them at home in the world; and
F32 1000  7    as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on her purse
F32 1010  3    as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman,
F32 1010 14    only because of her unobtrusive help.
F32 1020  6       Under Miss Upton, the work of the year 1909-10 went
F32 1030  7    forward without interruption. After all, she had come
F32 1040  4    to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891
F32 1040 14    except for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She
F32 1050  9    had taught classes in botany, astronomy (with the aid
F32 1060  7    of a telescope), geometry, and psychology.
F32 1080  2       Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact,
F32 1090  1    had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring
F32 1090 11    minds; and both believed that intellectual growth must
F32 1100  7    go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character
F32 1110  5    and Christian zeal. Both loved the out-of-doors, including
F32 1120  5    mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890 when
F32 1130  2    the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for
F32 1130 13    Miss Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip,
F32 1140 10    and "with rare executive ability" bore the brunt of
F32 1150  7    "the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end". So strenuous
F32 1160  6    it was physically, with its days of horseback riding
F32 1170  3    over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance
F32 1180  1    for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived
F32 1180 11    on it.
F32 1190  2       At the Fifteenth Anniversary (1896) as already quoted,
F32 1200  6    Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman
F32 1210  9    of the Future as a college of first rank, with expanding
F32 1220  9    and unlimited horizons. When Dr. Wallace Buttrick,
F32 1230  5    wise in his judgment of people, declined to have the
F32 1240  4    Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley
F32 1250  1    (April 7, 1923) "... If you had asked me, I think I
F32 1250 13    would have suggested that you name the building for
F32 1260  8    Miss Upton. Her services to the School for many years
F32 1270  7    were of a very high character, and I have often thought
F32 1280  4    that one of the buildings should be named for her".
F32 1290  1       Such were the qualities of the Acting-President
F32 1290  9    of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles.
F32 1310  7       At the meeting of the Board of Trustees, on March
F32 1320  6    3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual report of
F32 1330  3    the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn
F32 1340  1    through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed
F32 1340  9    an increase of boarding students as was desired; and
F32 1350  8    that the year's work had gone forward smoothly. She
F32 1360  6    urged the importance of more thorough preparation for
F32 1370  3    admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund
F32 1380  2    two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous
F32 1380 12    "praise demonstration" held afterward on the campus,
F32 1390  7    were reported as events which had brought happiness
F32 1400  6    to Miss Giles. With the Fund in hand, the debt on the
F32 1410  6    boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard Halls
F32 1420  2    had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been
F32 1420 11    broken for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke
F32 1430  8    gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and
F32 1440  7    Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund, and their
F32 1450  5    continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed
F32 1460  2    current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness
F32 1460 10    of the many individuals and agencies whose interest
F32 1470  7    and efforts through the years had made the work so
F32 1480  7    fruitful in results.
F32 1480 10       Two bequests were recorded: one of $200 under the
F32 1490  8    will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles; and one
F32 1500  7    of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of
F32 1510  4    Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.
F32 1520  1       Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss
F32 1520 11    Giles was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever
F32 1530  9    been called upon to bear. The daughters of Spelman,
F32 1550  7    she said, had never known or thought of Spelman without
F32 1560  4    her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had
F32 1570  2    caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles.
F32 1580  1    Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has
F32 1580 10    strong, deep roots, and will live for the blessing
F32 1590  7    of generations to come".
F32 1590 11    #@#
F32 1600  1    Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became
F32 1600  9    ill in March, 1910; and when school closed, she was
F32 1610  9    unable to travel to Massachusetts. She remained in
F32 1620  4    Atlanta through June and July; she died on August sixth.
F32 1630  5       Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885, Miss
F32 1640  4    Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and
F32 1650  1    her position there was held open for her for a considerable
F32 1650 12    period. But she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped
F32 1660  9    with teaching as well as office work for a few years-
F32 1670  8    the catalogues show that she had classes in geography,
F32 1680  3    rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed
F32 1690  1    all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders
F32 1690 11    in all their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic,
F32 1700  8    cheerful and calm, she too was a power in the development
F32 1710  9    of the seminary. Miss Giles always used to refer to
F32 1720  6    her as "Sister". She served as secretary in the Seminary
F32 1730  4    office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence,
F32 1740  1    records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold
F32 1740 10    a memorial to her; and so do the hearts of students
F32 1750 10    and of teachers.
F32 1760  1       Mary J. Packard, states a Messenger editorial, was
F32 1760  9    "efficient, pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating
F32 1770  7    the spirit of her Master. With infinite patience she
F32 1780  6    responded to every call, no matter at what cost to
F32 1790  5    herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to have
F32 1800  2    the needed information or word of cheer.
