F23 0010  1    I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are
F23 0010 11    self-evident, in the sense that everyone agrees with
F23 0020  7    them. If they were, Walter Lippmann would be writing
F23 0030  4    the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock would
F23 0040  2    have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however,
F23 0040 12    that I take them for granted, and that everything I
F23 0050 10    shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against
F23 0060  6    any contrary assumptions.
F23 0070  1    _ASSUMPTION 1._
F23 0070  2       The ultimate objective of American policy is to
F23 0070 10    help establish a world in which there is the largest
F23 0080  9    possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and
F23 0090  6    material prosperity; and in particular- since this
F23 0100  5    is our special responsibility- that these conditions
F23 0110  1    be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak
F23 0110 12    of "the largest possible measure" because any person
F23 0120  6    who supposes that these conditions can be universally
F23 0130  5    and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons without the inherent
F23 0140  4    imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings,
F23 0150  2    and is therefore a dangerous man to have around.
F23 0160  1    _ASSUMPTION 2._
F23 0160  2       These conditions are unobtainable- are not even
F23 0160  9    approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated-
F23 0170  8    without the prior defeat of world Communism. This is
F23 0180  6    true for two reasons: because Communism is both doctrinally,
F23 0190  4    and in practice, antithetical to these conditions;
F23 0200  1    and because Communists have the will and, as long as
F23 0200 11    Soviet power remains intact, the capacity to prevent
F23 0210  8    their realization. Moreover, as Communist power increases,
F23 0220  5    the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world
F23 0230  4    diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration
F23 0240  3    becomes increasingly remote.
F23 0240  6    _ASSUMPTION 3._
F23 0240  8       It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant,
F23 0250  9    proximate goal of American policy. Proximate in the
F23 0260  7    sense that there are more distant, more "positive"
F23 0270  3    ends we seek, to which victory over Communism is but
F23 0280  3    a means. But dominant in the sense that every other
F23 0280 13    objective, no matter how worthy intrinsically, must
F23 0290  7    defer to it. Peace is a worthy objective; but if we
F23 0300  5    must choose between peace and keeping the Communists
F23 0310  2    out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the
F23 0310 12    sense of self-determination, is a worthy objective;
F23 0320  8    but if granting self-determination to the Algerian
F23 0330  4    rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet
F23 0340  4    orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice
F23 0350  1    is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails
F23 0350 11    driving the government of the Union of South Africa
F23 0360  9    away from the West, then the Bantus must be prepared
F23 0370  7    to carry their identification cards yet a while longer.
F23 0380  5    Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing
F23 0390  1    higher standards of living gets in the way of producing
F23 0390 11    sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression, then
F23 0400  7    material sacrifices and denials will have to be made.
F23 0410  7    It may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued
F23 0420  4    consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism;
F23 0430  1    my point is that where conflicts arise they must always
F23 0430 11    be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable
F23 0440  8    condition for a tolerant world- the absence of Soviet
F23 0450  5    Communist power.
F23 0450  7    #THE USES OF POWER#
F23 0460  2    This much having been said, the question remains whether
F23 0460 11    we have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat
F23 0470 12    Communism- and, if so, how those resources ought to
F23 0480  9    be used. This brings us squarely to the problem of
F23 0490  5    power, and the uses a nation makes of power. I submit
F23 0500  3    that this is the key problem of international relations,
F23 0500 12    that it always has been, that it always will be. And
F23 0510 11    I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble
F23 0520  8    we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers,
F23 0530  4    ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945,
F23 0540  3    to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.
F23 0550  1       In the recent political campaign two charges were
F23 0550  8    leveled affecting the question of power, and I think
F23 0560  8    we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus.
F23 0570  4    One was demonstrably false; the other, for the most
F23 0580  2    part, true.
F23 0580  4       The first was that America had become- or was in
F23 0590  3    danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I
F23 0590 12    know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of
F23 0600 11    that contention. You may have misgivings about certain
F23 0610  6    aspects of our military establishment- I certainly
F23 0620  5    do- but you know any comparison of over-all American
F23 0630  1    strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United
F23 0630 10    States not only superior, but so superior both in present
F23 0640 10    weapons and in the development of new ones that our
F23 0650  7    advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet
F23 0660  5    relations for the foreseeable future.
F23 0670  1       I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing
F23 0670 11    our superiority on those Americans who have doubts,
F23 0680  7    and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well
F23 0690  6    in his new book American Might and Soviet Myth. Suppose,
F23 0710  3    he says, that the tables were turned, and we were in
F23 0720  3    the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000
F23 0730  1    modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed
F23 0730  9    at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming
F23 0740  7    Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred
F23 0750  7    miles of our coast. Half of the population of the U.S.
F23 0760  4    would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people".
F23 0770  3    Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where
F23 0780  1    oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the
F23 0780 12    first opportunity. Add also a comparatively primitive
F23 0790  6    industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity
F23 0800  5    to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile
F23 0810  2    field which is reputed to be our main strength.
F23 0810 11       If we look at the situation this way, we can get
F23 0820 11    an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries- or, at
F23 0830  5    least, of the worries he might have if his enemies
F23 0840  3    were disposed to exploit their advantage.
F23 0840  9    #U.S. "PRESTIGE"#
F23 0850  1    The other charge was that America's political position
F23 0860  1    in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent
F23 0860  9    years. The contention needs to be formulated with much
F23 0870  8    greater precision than it ever was during the campaign,
F23 0880  6    but once that has been done, I fail to see how any
F23 0890  4    serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.
F23 0900  1       The argument was typically advanced in terms of
F23 0900  9    U.S. "prestige". Prestige, however, is only a minor
F23 0910  7    part of the problem; and even then, it is a concept
F23 0920  7    that can be highly misleading. Prestige is a measure
F23 0930  4    of how other people think of you, well or ill. But
F23 0930 15    contrary to what was implied during the campaign, prestige
F23 0940  9    is surely not important for its own sake. Only the
F23 0950  7    vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep
F23 0960  5    simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed
F23 0970  1    by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose
F23 0970 13    sleep over is what people, having concluded that we
F23 0980  8    are weaker than we are, are likely to do about it.
F23 0990  6       The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe
F23 1000  2    the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union,
F23 1000 11    and is bound to fall still further behind in the years
F23 1010 11    ahead. This ignorant estimate, I repeat, is not of
F23 1020  7    any interest in itself; but it becomes very important
F23 1030  3    if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically
F23 1040  1    do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears
F23 1040 11    to be the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining
F23 1050 10    U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted
F23 1060  8    to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat,
F23 1070  5    and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation,
F23 1080  2    there is reason for concern.
F23 1080  7       Still, these guesses about the outcome of the struggle
F23 1090  7    cannot be as important as the actual power relationship
F23 1100  4    between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here I do not
F23 1110  4    speak of military power where our advantage is obvious
F23 1110 13    and overwhelming but of political power- of influence,
F23 1120  8    if you will- about which the relevant questions are:
F23 1130  7    Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or
F23 1140  5    less than it was ten years ago? And is Western influence
F23 1150  2    greater or less than it used to be?
F23 1150 10    #COMMUNIST GAINS#
F23 1160  1    In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely
F23 1160 11    whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories
F23 1170  8    they did not occupy before, and not merely whether
F23 1180  6    disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control
F23 1190  4    of governments from which they were formerly excluded:
F23 1200  1    the success of Communism's war against the West does
F23 1200 10    not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests.
F23 1210  7    Success may mean merely the displacement of Western
F23 1220  5    influence.
F23 1220  6       Communist political warfare, we must remember, is
F23 1230  6    waged insidiously and in deliberate stages. Fearful
F23 1240  2    of inviting a military showdown with the West which
F23 1240 11    they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine
F23 1250  9    Western power where the nuclear might of the West is
F23 1260  8    irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob
F23 1270  3    uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine
F23 1280  1    meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United
F23 1280  8    Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences-
F23 1290  8    preferably at the highest level.
F23 1300  4       The Soviets understand, moreover, that the first
F23 1310  2    step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn
F23 1310 12    it against the West. Thus, typically, the first stage
F23 1320  8    of a Communist takeover is to "neutralize" a country.
F23 1330  6    The second stage is to retain the nominal classification
F23 1340  3    of "neutralist", while in fact turning the country
F23 1350  2    into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy.
F23 1350 11    And this may be as far as the process will go. The
F23 1360 12    Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture, not of
F23 1370  7    Ghana, but of the United States- and this purpose may
F23 1380  7    be served very well by countries that masquerade under
F23 1390  2    a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries
F23 1400  1    of the Soviet Foreign Office.
F23 1400  6       To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes
F23 1410  4    is hardly reassuring.
F23 1410  7       Six years ago French Indochina, though in troubie,
F23 1420  6    was in the Western camp. Today Northern Vietnam is
F23 1430  4    overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between Communism
F23 1440  2    and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all
F23 1450  1    practical purposes, neutralist.
F23 1450  4       Indonesia, in the early days of the Republic, leaned
F23 1460  4    toward the West. Today Sukarno's government is heavily
F23 1470  3    besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist"
F23 1480  1    pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.
F23 1490  1       Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation
F23 1490  8    to a neutralism openly hostile to the West.
F23 1500  5       In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and Egypt were,
F23 1510  3    a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser
F23 1520  1    and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the
F23 1520  9    West, are dependent for their military power on Soviet
F23 1530  7    equipment and personnel; in almost every particular
F23 1540  5    follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.
F23 1550  1       A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve.
F23 1550 11    Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed
F23 1560  9    Wilsonian self-determination: the point is that in
F23 1570  6    the struggle for the world that vast land mass was
F23 1580  5    under the domination and influence of the West. Today,
F23 1590  1    Africa is swerving violently away from the West and
F23 1590 10    plunging, it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.
F23 1600  8       Latin America was once an area as "safe" for the
F23 1610  7    West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today it is up for
F23 1620  5    grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become
F23 1630  1    a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In
F23 1630 10    some countries the trend has gone further than others:
F23 1640  8    Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy
F23 1650  5    for Castroism, and there is no country- save the Dominican
F23 1660  6    Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged-
F23 1670  1    where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent
F23 1680  1    the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American
F23 1680  8    cause.
F23 1690  1       Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and
F23 1690 10    there only on the surface. The strains of neutralism
F23 1700  6    are running strong, notably in England, and even in
F23 1710  5    Germany.
F23 1710  6    #OPPORTUNITIES MISSED#
F23 1710  8    What have we to show by way of counter-successes? We
F23 1720 10    have had opportunities- clear invitations to plant
F23 1730  7    our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
F23 1740  2    There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised
F23 1750  1    and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish
F23 1750 11    Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide
F23 1760  8    along a course favorable to Soviet interests. There
F23 1770  5    was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did
F23 1780  2    not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively
F23 1790  1    and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power:
F23 1790  8    in Guatemala. And contrary to what has been said recently,
F23 1800  9    we did not wait for "outside pressures" and "world
F23 1810  4    opinion" to bring down that Communist government; we
F23 1820  3    moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist coup d'etat.
F23 1830  2    We served our national interests, and by so doing we
F23 1840  1    saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.
