D16 0010  1       Pope Leo XIII, on the 13th day of December 1898,
D16 0010 11    granted the following indulgences: "An indulgence of
D16 0020  7    three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who
D16 0030  7    read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour.
D16 0040  5    A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is
D16 0050  2    granted once a month for the daily reading". Pope Pius
D16 0050 12    the Sixth, at Rome, in april, 1778, wrote the following:
D16 0060  9    "The faithful should be excited to the reading of the
D16 0070  9    Holy Scriptures: For these are the most abundant sources
D16 0080  6    which ought to be left open to everyone, to draw from
D16 0090  4    them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate
D16 0100  1    errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt
D16 0100 10    times". The American Bishops assembled at the Third
D16 0110  7    Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people
D16 0120  5    to read the Holy Bible. "We hope", they said, "that
D16 0130  4    no family can be found amongst us without a correct
D16 0140  2    version of the Holy Scriptures". They recommended,
D16 0140  9    also, that "at a fixed hour, let the entire family
D16 0150 10    be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short
D16 0160  6    reading of the Holy Scriptures".
D16 0170  1       Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire
D16 0170  8    that the Sacred Scriptures be read, the following taken
D16 0180  7    from the Holy Bible (New Catholic Edition) will prove
D16 0190  5    a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing.
D16 0200  3    #THE NEED OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0200  9    Do not wonder that I said to thee, "You must be born
D16 0210  9    again". St. John 3:7.
D16 0220  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE GOD IS HOLY._
D16 0220 10       But as the One who called you is holy, be you also
D16 0230  9    holy in all your behavior; for it is written, You shall
D16 0240  6    be holy, because I am holy. I St. Peter 1:15, 16.
D16 0250  3       Holiness without which no man will see God. Hebrews
D16 0260  2    12:14.
D16 0270  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL HAVE SINNED._
D16 0270  1       As it is written, There is not one just man; there
D16 0270 12    is none who understands; there is none who seeks after
D16 0280  9    God. All have gone astray together; ... All have sinned
D16 0290  7    and have need of the glory of God. Romans 3:10-12,
D16 0300  5    23.
D16 0310  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE NATURAL MAN
D16 0310  3    IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND._
D16 0310  8       Therefore as through one man sin entered into the
D16 0320  7    world and through sin death, and thus death has passed
D16 0330  3    unto all men because all have sinned. Romans 5:12.
D16 0330 12       You also, when you were dead by reason of your offenses
D16 0340 12    and sins. Ephesians 2:1.
D16 0350  3       And if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled only
D16 0360  2    to those who are perishing. In their case, the god
D16 0360 12    of this world [Satan] has blinded their unbelieving
D16 0370  7    minds, that they should not see the light of the gospel
D16 0380  8    of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. II
D16 0390  4    Corinthians 4:3, 4.
D16 0390  7       For his workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus.
D16 0400  7    Ephesians 2:10.
D16 0410  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD_
D16 0410  8       For you have been reborn, not from corruptible seed
D16 0420  5    but from incorruptible, through the word of God. I
D16 0430  3    St. Peter 1:23.
D16 0430  6       Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of
D16 0440  6    truth. St. James 1:18.
D16 0440 10       Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born
D16 0450 10    again of water [symbol of the Word of God, see Ephesians
D16 0460  6    5:26] and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
D16 0470  4    of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and
D16 0480  2    that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. St. John
D16 0480 13    3:5, 6.
D16 0490  2    #EVIDENCES OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0500  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE HAVE FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE
D16 0500  6    ONLY SAVIOUR._
D16 0500  8       Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is
D16 0510  6    born of God. I St. John 5:1.
D16 0520  1       As many as received him ... were born ... of God.
D16 0520 12    St. John 1:12, 13.
D16 0530  2    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE DO NOT PRACTICE SIN AS A
D16 0540  1    HABIT._
D16 0540  1       Whoever is born of God does not commit sin [That
D16 0540 11    is, he does not practice sin. Cf. I St. John 2:1].
D16 0550  8    I St. John 3:9.
D16 0560  1       We know that no one who is born of God commits sin.
D16 0560 13    I St. John 5:18. [The new nature, received at the
D16 0570 10    time of regeneration, is divine and holy, and as the
D16 0580  8    believer lives under the power of this new nature he
D16 0590  6    does not practice sin.]
D16 0600  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS._
D16 0600  5       If you know that he [God] is just [righteous], know
D16 0610  3    that everyone also who does what is just [righteous]
D16 0620  1    has been born of him. I St. John 2:29.
D16 0630  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE GOD._
D16 0630  7       Everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.
D16 0640  3    I St. John 4:7.
D16 0650  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE THE BRETHREN._
D16 0650  3       We know that we have passed from death to life,
D16 0650 13    because we love the brethren. He who does not love
D16 0660 10    abides in death. I St. John 3:14.
D16 0680  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE OVERCOME THE WORLD._
D16 0680  1       All that is born of God overcomes the world; and
D16 0680 11    this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.
D16 0690  7    I St. John 5:4.
D16 0700  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE GROW IN [NOT INTO, BUT IN]
D16 0700 14    GRACE._
D16 0700 15       But grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and
D16 0710 10    Savior, Jesus Christ. II St. Peter 3:18.
D16 0730  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PERSEVERE UNTO THE END._
D16 0730  3       I am convinced of this, that he who has begun a
D16 0730 14    good work in you will bring it to perfection until
D16 0740  9    the day of Christ Jesus. Philippians 1:6.
D16 0750  3       Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin
D16 0760  2    and to set you before the presence of his glory, without
D16 0760 13    blemish, in gladness, to the only God our Savior, through
D16 0770 10    Jesus Christ our Lord, belong glory and majesty, dominion
D16 0780  8    and authority, before all time, and now, and forever.
D16 0790  7    St. Jude 24.
D16 0800  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM
D16 0810  1    REQUIRES A SPIRITUAL NATURE._
D16 0810  1       Jesus answered and said to him [Nicodemus] "Amen,
D16 0810  9    amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he
D16 0820 10    cannot see the kingdom of God". ... "Amen, amen, I
D16 0830  5    say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and
D16 0840  4    the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
D16 0840 14    That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
D16 0850 11    which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not wonder
D16 0860  8    that I said to thee, 'You must be born again'". St.
D16 0870  5    John 3:3, 5-7.
D16 0870  9    #THE NATURE OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0880  3    _THE NEW BIRTH IS A NEW CREATION._
D16 0880 10       For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
D16 0890  5    but a new creation is of any account. Galatians 6:15.
D16 0900  5       If then any man is in Christ, he is a new creature
D16 0910  6    [literally, "He is a new creation"], the former things
D16 0920  3    have passed away; behold, they are made new! II Corinthians
D16 0930  1    5:17.
D16 0930  2       For by grace you have been saved through faith;
D16 0940  1    and that not from yourselves, for it is the gift of
D16 0940 12    God; not as the outcome of works, lest anyone may boast.
D16 0950 10    For his workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus.
D16 0960  7    Ephesians 2:8-10.
D16 0970  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE IMPLANTATION OF A NEW LIFE._
D16 0970  8       I came that they may have life. St. John 10:10.
D16 0980  4       He who has the Son has the life. He who has not
D16 0990  4    the Son has not the life. I St. John 5:12.
D16 1000  1       He who believes in the Son [Jesus Christ, the Son
D16 1000 11    of God], has everlasting life. St. John 3:36.
D16 1020  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE._
D16 1020  6       Through which he has granted us the very great and
D16 1030  5    precious promises, so that through them you may become
D16 1040  1    partaker of the divine nature. II St. Peter 1:4.
D16 1050  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU BY FAITH._
D16 1050  9       Christ in you, your hope of glory. Colossians 1:27.
D16 1060  5       It is now no longer I that live, but Christ lives
D16 1070  4    in me. And the life that I now live in the flesh, I
D16 1080  2    live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and
D16 1080 15    gave himself up for me. Galatians 2:20.
D16 1090  6       To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts.
D16 1100  5    Ephesians 3:17.
D16 1110  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS AND MYSTERIOUS._
D16 1110  3       The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its
D16 1120  2    sound but dost not know where it comes from or where
D16 1120 13    it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
D16 1130 10    St. John 3:8.
D16 1140  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS._
D16 1140  7       Amen, amen, I say to you, he who hears my word,
D16 1150  7    and believes him who sent me, has life everlasting,
D16 1160  1    and does not come to judgment, but has passed from
D16 1160 11    death to life. St. John 5:24.
D16 1170  5    #THE MEANS OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 1180  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS A WORK OF GOD._
D16 1180  7       But to as many as received him he gave the power
D16 1190  2    of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in his
D16 1190 13    name: Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of
D16 1200 12    the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. St.
D16 1210  8    John 1:12, 13.
D16 1210 11    #A FINAL WORD#
D16 1220  1    You may be very religious, a good church member, an
D16 1220 11    upright, honest and sincere person; you may be baptized,
D16 1230  8    confirmed, reverent and worshipful; you may attend
D16 1240  4    mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously keep all
D16 1250  3    the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may
D16 1250 12    have the final and extreme unction but if you are not
D16 1260 11    born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal
D16 1270  7    punishment. You cannot be saved; you cannot go to heaven
D16 1280  6    unless you are born again. Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ,
D16 1290  3    the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said, "Amen,
D16 1300  1    amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he
D16 1300 13    cannot see the kingdom of God" (St. John 3:3). "You
D16 1310  9    must be born again" (St. John 3:7).
D16 1320  4       Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting
D16 1330  4    Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy
D16 1340  1    Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort
D16 1340 12    to be saved by any form of good works, and just now
D16 1350 10    receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation
D16 1360  4    as a free gift from Him.
D16 1365  1       YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE with God now. It is permitted.
D16 1370  8    God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus
D16 1380  6    Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man
D16 1390  4    in one Being. He was then in man's hands. They cursed
D16 1400  2    Him. It was permitted. Men spit on Him. God allowed
D16 1400 12    it. They called Him a devil. God withheld His wrath.
D16 1410 10    Finally men arrested Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged
D16 1420  8    Him, nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth
D16 1430  6    and heaven; and God allowed it.
D16 1440  1       You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily
D16 1440 10    present. You can ignore Him. You can ignore His Book,
D16 1450  8    the Bible, and His church. You can laugh at His blood-bought
D16 1460  7    salvation, curse His followers, and laugh at hell.
D16 1470  4    It is permitted. The eternal Christ may knock at your
D16 1480  1    soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare
D16 1480 11    for heaven. You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him
D16 1490 10    a devil, curse Him. It is permitted. You may take His
D16 1500  7    name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose.
D16 1510  5    He is in your hands- now.
D16 1510 11       On the other hand, you may seek His favor, humble
D16 1520  9    yourself before Him and beg His mercy, implore His
D16 1530  5    forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon your whole
D16 1540  3    life to Him. He has said, "Behold, I stand at the door,
D16 1550  1    and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door,
D16 1550 13    I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
D16 1560 12    with me" (Revelation 3:20). The choice is up to you.
D16 1570  8    The latch is on your side of the door. The choice is
D16 1580  5    yours: the revellings and banquetings of this world
D16 1590  2    or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts
D16 1590 11    of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit
D16 1600  8    discipline. The choice is yours: God is in your hands,
D16 1610  7    now.
D16 1610  8       God has already set the day when you will be in
D16 1620  8    His hands. What He does with you then depends on what
D16 1630  4    you do with Him now. Then it will be a "fearful thing
D16 1640  4    to fall into the hands of the living God" if you have
D16 1650  2    abused Him in your hands.
