J27 0010  1       With this evidence in mind, the writer began to
J27 0010 10    plan how he might more effectively educate the married
J27 0020  6    students in his functional classes. Toward the end
J27 0030  4    of the semester's work, he interviewed every married
J27 0040  2    class member at great length. He found, as he had suspected,
J27 0050  1    a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present
J27 0060 10    functionally designed course was not really functional
J27 0070  6    for these students. However, all admitted that the
J27 0080  5    "hind sight" was not altogether lost. In their own
J27 0090  2    words, it had aided them to get a clearer picture of
J27 0090 13    how they had gotten into their marriages, and perhaps
J27 0100  8    they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles
J27 0110  6    appeared from time to time. In fact, they went so far
J27 0120  5    as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design
J27 0130  1    a section exclusively for married students there should
J27 0130  9    be, at the beginning, some "hind sight" study; but
J27 0140  8    they all hastened to add that certainly less time was
J27 0150  7    needed on it than presently spent. All of them felt
J27 0160  5    a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could
J27 0170  1    be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional
J27 0170 11    course.
J27 0180  1       A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive
J27 0180 11    section for married students. As one of them expressed
J27 0190  9    it, "It has done me a world of good to listen to the
J27 0200  9    nai^ve questions and comments of these not-yet-married
J27 0210  5    people. I can now better see just what processes provoked
J27 0220  2    certain actions from me in the past. Had I been in
J27 0220 13    an all-married section I would have missed this, and
J27 0230  8    I believe that this single aspect has been of great
J27 0240  6    personal value to me". This comment and others similar
J27 0250  4    to it, would seem to indicate a possible justification
J27 0260  1    for continuing the status quo. But the weight of feeling
J27 0260 11    was heavily in the opposite direction. Thus, the writer
J27 0270  8    decided to hold one experimental section of the functional
J27 0280  5    preparation for marriage course in the spring semester
J27 0290  5    of 1960 exclusively for persons already married- that
J27 0300  4    is, prerequisite: "marriage". This did not mean that
J27 0300 12    married students could not enroll in other "mixed"
J27 0310  8    sections, and some of them, largely because of scheduling
J27 0320  7    difficulties, did. But only those already married could
J27 0330  5    enroll in this one section. In addition, two other
J27 0340  3    differences in the two types of sections must be noted.
J27 0340 13    1) The regular sections do not allow freshmen; this
J27 0350  9    one did. This action was rationalized on the basis
J27 0360  6    of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage
J27 0370  4    of married freshmen women on our campus never become
J27 0380  1    sophomores. Many of them appear to drop out, for one
J27 0380 11    reason or another. By permitting freshman students
J27 0390  5    we might extend the opportunity for such a course to
J27 0400  6    some individuals who otherwise might never get to take
J27 0410  3    it. This has subsequently been verified by the experience.
J27 0410 12    2) Auditors were encouraged. In the regular sections
J27 0420  8    they have always been more or less discouraged. The
J27 0430  7    philosophy has been that if they could find the time
J27 0440  4    to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit
J27 0450  1    and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more
J27 0450 11    effectively. Besides, auditors do not count on faculty
J27 0460  8    load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students.
J27 0470  5    But in this one section we welcomed auditors. Why?
J27 0480  3    For no particular reason, other than that the writer
J27 0490  1    felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to
J27 0490 10    be in attendance. Many of the men on our campus have
J27 0510  9    a pretty set curriculum, especially in the various
J27 0520  4    engineering fields, with few electives till the senior
J27 0530  1    year. Incidentally, it needs to be noted that because
J27 0530 10    auditors were permitted the section began increasing
J27 0540  6    in numbers each week, until at last it swelled to such
J27 0550  7    proportions that this "free" auditing policy had to
J27 0560  4    be retracted. After that, we began to get "visitors"
J27 0570  1    to class.
J27 0570  3       This experimental class represented quite a variety
J27 0580  1    of students. It ranged from a freshman woman, just
J27 0580 10    married, through the various academic growth stages,
J27 0590  6    including one senior-graduate student, to a young faculty
J27 0600  5    member recently married to a senior man who also attended.
J27 0610  2    It ranged from those with no children, through students
J27 0620  1    in various stages of pregnancy, to one 44-year-old
J27 0620 11    male with four children, three of whom were teenagers.
J27 0630  6    It ranged from two women members who had experienced
J27 0640  4    premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married
J27 0650  1    and seemingly unable to conceive.
J27 0650  6       One might digress at this point and speculate that
J27 0660  6    if it is "wise" to create special sections for special
J27 0670  3    status, then why not a special section for women pregnant
J27 0680  1    before marriage, and one for 44-year-old men with teenage
J27 0680 12    children, and so on. Some of these speculations may
J27 0690  9    have some merit, others are somewhat ambiguous. But
J27 0700  5    few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact
J27 0710  3    that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different
J27 0720  1    in marriage than in a pre-marital situation.
J27 0720  9       The writer began this special class by explaining
J27 0730  7    his background thinking for creating such a section
J27 0740  5    in the first place. He made it clear from the beginning
J27 0750  2    that this was the students' opportunity, and that the
J27 0750 11    future destiny of such groups depended on favorable
J27 0770  8    results from this one. He did build a framework of
J27 0780  7    academic "respectability", and one which did not encroach
J27 0790  5    upon the "sacred sovereignty" of any other existing
J27 0800  2    campus course. This is to say that this was not a course
J27 0810  1    in wise buying or money spending methods, nor a course
J27 0810 11    in how to raise children. We already have courses covering
J27 0820  7    those problems, and so on. But within that framework
J27 0830  5    he allowed for as much flexibility as possible. A steering
J27 0840  3    committee of students was organized on the first day
J27 0850  1    whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate
J27 0850 11    and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was
J27 0860  8    taking. The writer, being cognizant through his interviews
J27 0870  5    of the reactions of previous married students, did
J27 0880  3    insist on there being included some "hind sight" material.
J27 0890  1    But the greater part of semester time was actually
J27 0890 10    centered around the attitudes "So we are married- now
J27 0900  8    how do we make the best of it"? or "How do we enrich
J27 0910  8    our already fine marriage"?
J27 0920  1       Films were used, as with all sections, but with
J27 0920 10    one big difference. Our campus, unfortunately, owns
J27 0930  5    no films. Since they are all either rented or borrowed,
J27 0940  5    the requested dates for their use have to be far in
J27 0950  4    advance. The writer never knew from week to week just
J27 0950 14    where the section might be. For example, the steering
J27 0960  9    committee might announce that the group felt a topic
J27 0970  7    under study should not be dropped for an additional
J27 0980  3    week as there was still too much of it untouched. Since
J27 0990  1    the writer had established this democratic procedure
J27 0990  8    in the beginning he had to go along with their decision-
J27 1000  9    after, of course, pointing out whether he thought their
J27 1010  5    decision was a wise or an unwise one. Thus the films
J27 1020  2    seen as they came in (coordinated for the regular sections),
J27 1030  1    were often out of context. Nevertheless, the writer
J27 1030  9    has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion
J27 1040  5    after film showings.
J27 1040  8       Though it did not become known to the writer for
J27 1050 10    some time, a nucleus group had sprung up within the
J27 1060  6    class. They began to meet in the evenings and carry
J27 1070  2    forward various discussions they felt not fully enough
J27 1070 10    covered in class. From a few students this group gradually
J27 1080 10    increased to include over three-fourths of those officially
J27 1090  7    enrolled in the class, and many outsiders as well.
J27 1100  5    Also, although only a few of the students were intimately
J27 1110  2    acquainted with each other in the beginning, most reported
J27 1120  1    that when the semester ended their dearest and closest
J27 1120 10    campus friendships were with members of that class.
J27 1130  7    In fact, they often revamped their social activities
J27 1140  4    to include class members previously unknown.
J27 1150  1       Supplemental outside reading reports were handled
J27 1150  7    just as in the other sections, the major difference
J27 1160  6    being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the
J27 1170  5    reported outside reading by the married group. These
J27 1180  2    students, although they might read various articles
J27 1180  9    in popular magazines, more often chose to report on
J27 1190  8    articles found in the journals. In addition to the
J27 1200  5    noticeable difference in outside articles, there was
J27 1210  3    a considerable difference in the outside books they
J27 1210 11    read. Whereas a high per cent of the regular students
J27 1220  9    can be expected to read other texts which more or less
J27 1230  7    plow the same ground in a little different direction,
J27 1240  2    the married students chose whole books on specific
J27 1240 10    areas and went into much greater detail in their areas
J27 1250 10    of interest. Since the writer had not noticed this
J27 1260  7    characteristic in married students scattered throughout
J27 1270  2    the various sections previous to this experiment, nor,
J27 1280  2    as a matter of fact, in those who were continuing in
J27 1280 13    "single sections", he can only conclude that there
J27 1290  7    must have been something "contagious" within the specific
J27 1300  4    group which caused this to occur.
J27 1310  1       In the main, this course took the following directional
J27 1310 10    high roads: 1) A great deal of time was spent on processes
J27 1320 11    for solving marital differences. This was not a search
J27 1330  8    for a "magic formula", but rather an examination of
J27 1340  6    basic principles pertaining especially to all types
J27 1350  4    of communication in marriage. In short, it was centered
J27 1360  1    around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy.
J27 1360 10    Not until the group was satisfied in this area were
J27 1370  9    they willing to venture further to 2) Specific adjustment
J27 1380  5    areas, such as sex, in-laws, religion, finance, and
J27 1390  3    so on. From here they proceeded to 3) These same areas
J27 1400  1    in relation to their own future family life stages,
J27 1400 10    developing these to the extent of examining various
J27 1410  7    crises which could be expected to confront them at
J27 1420  4    some time or other.
J27 1420  8       As an example of this last facet, there were some
J27 1430  5    lengthy discussions centered around bereavement. Mainly
J27 1440  2    these were concerned with the possibility of the death
J27 1440 11    of one parent and the complication of living with the
J27 1450 10    survivor afterward, but the possible death of one's
J27 1460  7    own spouse was not overlooked. Since the course, one
J27 1470  4    member has lost her husband. This was not a particularly
J27 1480  1    shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known
J27 1480  9    to her that it might happen. But just when was an unknown,
J27 1490 11    and of course the longer it did not happen, the stronger
J27 1500  8    her wish and belief that it might not. Since her bereavement
J27 1510  5    this individual has reported to the writer on numerous
J27 1520  3    occasions about how helpful the class discussions were
J27 1530  1    to her in this adjustment crisis.
J27 1530  7       Quite frequently class members brought questions
J27 1540  3    from their mates at home. These were often carefully
J27 1550  1    written out with a great deal of thought behind them.
J27 1550 11    This added a personal zest to class discussions and
J27 1560  8    participation.
J27 1560  9       Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex
J27 1570  8    adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening.
J27 1580  4    The writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion,
J27 1590  3    especially of this one area, than ever before. He felt
J27 1600  2    certain for the first time in his teaching experience
J27 1600 11    that the men in the class understood that orgasm, as
J27 1610  8    a criterion, is not nearly so essential for a satisfying
J27 1620  5    female sexual experience as most males might think.
J27 1630  2    This was probably much more meaningful because all
J27 1630 10    the women in the class emphasized it time and again.
J27 1640  9    On the other hand, the women class members appeared
J27 1650  5    to reach a far greater understanding than have women
J27 1660  3    members in other sections that it is more natural for
J27 1660 13    males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always
J27 1670 12    associating it with love as most women seem to do.
J27 1680  8       in the reproductive area it could be readily observed
J27 1690  4    that all felt freer to discuss things than students
J27 1700  1    had previously in "mixed" marital status sections.
J27 1700  8    Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were
J27 1710  9    in on it to some extent. Never in other sections has
J27 1720  5    there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth
J27 1730  1    discussions about the feelings of both spouses during
J27 1730  9    various stages of pregnancy. There was a particularly
J27 1740  8    marvelous opportunity for study in this area since
J27 1750  7    almost every stage of pregnancy was represented, from
J27 1760  2    a childless couple to and including every trimester.
J27 1770  1    In fact, we had one birth before the end of the course,
J27 1770 13    and another student had to take the final examiantion
J27 1780  7    a week early, just to be on the safe side. There was
J27 1790  5    also one spontaneous abortion during the semester.
