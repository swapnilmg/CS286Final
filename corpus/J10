J10 0010  1       Apart from the honeybee, practically all bees and
J10 0010  9    bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor. Occasionally,
J10 0020  8    you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold
J10 0030  7    season, when you are turning over sods in your garden,
J10 0040  4    but you have to be a really keen observer to see them
J10 0050  1    at all. They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly
J10 0050 11    against their bodies, and in spite of their often colorful
J10 0060  9    attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of
J10 0070  6    dirt. I must add at once that these animals are what
J10 0080  3    we call "queens", young females that have mated in
J10 0080 12    the previous summer or autumn. It is on them alone
J10 0090  9    that the future of their race depends, for all their
J10 0100  6    relatives (mothers, husbands, brothers, and unmated
J10 0110  3    sisters) have perished with the arrival of the cold
J10 0110 12    weather. Even some of the queens will die before the
J10 0120 10    winter is over, falling prey to enemies or disease.
J10 0130  6    The survivors emerge on some nice, sunny day in March
J10 0140  4    or April, when the temperature is close to 50` F and
J10 0150  2    there is not too much wind. Now the thing for us to
J10 0150 14    do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful
J10 0160  7    flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum
J10 0170  4    of our Pacific Northwest, or otherwise a good sloe
J10 0180  3    tree, or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom, preferably
J10 0190  1    one with male or staminate catkins. The blooms of Ribes
J10 0190 11    and of the willow and sloe are the places where large
J10 0200 10    numbers of our early insects will assemble: honeybees,
J10 0210  4    bumblebees, and other wild bees, and also various kinds
J10 0220  4    of flies. It is a happy, buzzing crowd.
J10 0230  1       Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number
J10 0230 10    of small flowers. It is not difficult to see that the
J10 0240  9    stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs,
J10 0250  4    and that each individual flower is nothing but one
J10 0260  1    such pair standing on a green, black-tipped little
J10 0260 10    scale. By scrutinizing the flowers, one can also notice
J10 0270  7    that the scale bears one or two tiny warts. Those are
J10 0280  5    the nectaries or honey glands (Fig. 26, page 74). The
J10 0290  3    staminate willow catkins, then, provide their visitors
J10 0290 10    with both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement,
J10 0300  8    for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to
J10 0310  8    make their beebread, a combination of honey and pollen
J10 0320  5    with which the young of all species are fed. The only
J10 0330  2    exception to this is certain bees that have become
J10 0330 11    parasites. I will deal with these later on.
J10 0340  7       Quite often, honeybees form a majority on the willow
J10 0350  5    catkins. As we have already seen in the first chapter,
J10 0360  2    bumblebees are bigger, hairier, and much more colorful
J10 0360 10    than honeybees, exhibiting various combinations of
J10 0370  5    black, yellow, white and orange. Let us not try to
J10 0380  7    key them out at this stage of the game, and let us
J10 0390  3    just call them Bombus; there must be several dozen
J10 0390 12    species in the United States alone. If you really insist
J10 0410  8    on knowing their names, an excellent book on the North
J10 0420  7    American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O.
J10 0430  5    E. Plath.
J10 0430  7       If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after
J10 0440  6    she has left her feeding place, we may discover the
J10 0450  3    snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself
J10 0460  1    when she woke up from her winter sleep. As befits a
J10 0460 12    queen, a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may
J10 0470  7    spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting
J10 0480  4    place. Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow
J10 0490  2    such as a deserted mouse nest, a bird house, or the
J10 0490 13    hole made by a woodpecker; some show a definite liking
J10 0500  9    for making their nest in moss. Once she has made up
J10 0510  7    her mind, the queen starts out by constructing, in
J10 0520  2    her chosen abode, a small "floor" of dried grass or
J10 0520 12    some woolly material. On this, she builds an "egg compartment"
J10 0530 10    or "egg cell" which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar
J10 0550 11    mixture called beebread. She also builds one or two
J10 0560  9    waxen cups which she fills with honey. Then, a group
J10 0570  6    of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf
J10 0580  3    and the egg compartment is closed. The queen afterward
J10 0590  1    keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother
J10 0590 10    hen, taking a sip from time to time from the rather
J10 0600  8    liquid honey in her honey pots. When the larvae hatch,
J10 0610  4    they feed on the beebread, although they also receive
J10 0620  1    extra honey meals from their mother. She continues
J10 0620  9    to add to the pollen supply as needed.
J10 0630  5       The larvae, kept warm by the queen, are full grown
J10 0640  4    in about ten days. Each now makes a tough, papery cocoon
J10 0650  1    and pupates. After another two weeks, the first young
J10 0650 10    emerge, four to eight small daughters that begin to
J10 0660  8    play the role of worker bees, collecting pollen and
J10 0670  4    nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation
J10 0680  2    while the queen retires to a life of egg laying. The
J10 0680 13    first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and
J10 0690 11    mating females do not emerge until later in the season.
J10 0700  7    The broods of workers that appear later tend to be
J10 0710  5    bigger than the first ones, probably because they are
J10 0720  1    better fed. By the middle of the summer, many of the
J10 0720 12    larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it
J10 0730  8    is "optimal", and it is then that young queens begin
J10 0740  5    to appear. Simultaneously, males or drones are produced,
J10 0750  2    mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers, although
J10 0750 10    a few may be produced by the queen. The young queens
J10 0760 11    and drones leave the nest and mate, and after a short
J10 0770  8    period of freedom, the fertilized young queens will
J10 0790  3    begin to dig in for the winter. It is an amazing fact
J10 0790 15    that in some species this will happen while the summer
J10 0800 10    is still in full swing, for instance, in August. The
J10 0810  7    temperature then is still very high. At the old nest,
J10 0820  6    the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized
J10 0830  3    eggs that will produce females. As a result, the proportion
J10 0840  1    of males (which leave the nest) increases, and eventually
J10 0840 10    the old colony will die out completely. The nest itself,
J10 0850  9    the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000
J10 0860  7    individuals when the season was at its peak, is now
J10 0870  4    rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain
J10 0880  1    beetles and moths.
J10 0880  4       Not always, though, does the development of a bumblebee
J10 0890  3    colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just
J10 0890 13    described. Some members of the bee family have become
J10 0900  9    idlers, social parasites that live at the expense of
J10 0910  7    their hardworking relatives. Bumblebees can thus suffer
J10 0920  4    severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus, the "cuckoo-bumblebee"
J10 0930  3    as it is called in some European countries. Female
J10 0940  2    individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the
J10 0940  9    workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize.
J10 0950  8    The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is
J10 0960  6    to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler,
J10 0970  5    Psithyrus, lack the pollen baskets- naturally! The
J10 0990  2    female parasite spends much time in her efforts to
J10 0990 11    find a nest of her host. When she succeeds, she usually
J10 1000  9    manages to slip in unobtrusively, to deposit an egg
J10 1010  5    on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees
J10 1020  2    seal the egg compartment. The hosts never seem to recognize
J10 1030  1    that something is amiss, so that the compartment afterward
J10 1030 10    is sealed normally. Thus, the larvae of the intruder
J10 1040  8    can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants
J10 1050  5    and the store of beebread. Later on, they and the mother
J10 1060  4    Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers. Worse still,
J10 1070  3    in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus
J10 1080  1    female kills off the Bombus queen.
J10 1080  7       But let us return, after this gruesome interlude,
J10 1090  5    to our willow catkins in the spring; there are other
J10 1100  4    wild bees that command our attention.
J10 1100 10       It is almost certain that some of these, usually
J10 1110  9    a trifle smaller than the honeybees, are andrenas or
J10 1120  5    mining bees. There are about 200 different kinds of
J10 1130  3    Andrena in Europe alone. One of my favorites is A.
J10 1140  1    armata, a species very common in England, where it
J10 1140 10    is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee. The females
J10 1150  9    like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns,
J10 1160  6    where their little mounds of earth often appear by
J10 1170  2    the hundreds. Almost equal in size to a honeybee. A.
J10 1170 12    armata is much more beautiful in color, at least in
J10 1180 10    the female of the species: a rich, velvety, rusty red.
J10 1190  6    The males are much duller.
J10 1200  1       After having mated, an Andrena female digs a hole
J10 1200 10    straight down into the ground, forming a burrow about
J10 1210  8    the size of a lead pencil. The bottom part of a burrow
J10 1220  7    has a number of side tunnels or "cells", each of which
J10 1230  4    is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread. The
J10 1240  1    development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid, so
J10 1240 10    that by the end of spring they have already pupated
J10 1250  8    and become adults. But they are still enclosed in their
J10 1260  6    larval cells and remain there throughout the summer,
J10 1270  3    fall, and winter. Their appearance, next spring, coincides
J10 1280  1    in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their
J10 1280 11    host plants. In the Sacramento valley in California,
J10 1290  7    for instance, it has been observed that there was not
J10 1300  5    one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas
J10 1310  4    and the opening of the willow catkins. This must be
J10 1320  1    due to a completely identical response to the weather,
J10 1320 10    in the plant and the animal.
J10 1330  3       After the male and female andrenas have mated, the
J10 1340  2    cycle is repeated. Although Andrena is gregarious,
J10 1340  9    so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows
J10 1350  8    together, we must still call it a solitary bee. Its
J10 1360  6    life history is much simpler than that of the truly
J10 1370  2    colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of
J10 1370 11    the life cycle of many other species. After all, social
J10 1380  9    life in the group of the bees is by no means general,
J10 1390  8    although it certainly is a striking feature. On the
J10 1400  4    basis of its life history, we like to think that Andrena
J10 1410  1    is more primitive than the bumblebees. The way in which
J10 1410 11    it transports its pollen is not so perfect, either.
J10 1420  8    It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large
J10 1430  6    number of long, branched hairs on its legs, on which
J10 1440  3    the pollen grains will collect. Still Andrena will
J10 1450  1    do a reasonably good job, so that an animal with a
J10 1450 12    full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow
J10 1460  8    down floating in the wind.
J10 1470  1       Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or
J10 1470 10    alkali bees. Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous
J10 1480  7    numbers in certain parts of the United States west
J10 1490  5    of the Great Plains, for example, in Utah and central
J10 1500  3    Washington. In the United States Department of Agriculture's
J10 1510  1    Yearbook of Agriculture, 1952, which is devoted entirely
J10 1520  1    to insects, George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah
J10 1520 11    which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females.
J10 1530  8    Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart, and
J10 1540  9    the bee cities cover several acres. The life history
J10 1550  4    of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena, but
J10 1560  2    the first activity of the adults does not take place
J10 1560 12    until summer, and the individuals hibernate in the
J10 1570  7    prepupal stage. In most places, there are two generations
J10 1580  5    a year, a second brood of adults appearing late in
J10 1590  3    the summer.
J10 1590  5       I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias.
J10 1600  3    This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington,
J10 1610  1    but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near
J10 1610 11    Yakima and Prosser in July or August, when the bees
J10 1620  9    are in their most active period. The name "alkali bee"
J10 1630  6    indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable
J10 1640  5    places. Sometimes, although by no means always, these
J10 1650  3    are indeed alkaline. The thing is that these bees love
J10 1670  1    a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in
J10 1670 12    the ground should not be stagnant either. They dislike
J10 1680  7    dense vegetation. Where does one find such conditions?
J10 1690  5    The best chance, of course, is offered by gently sloping
J10 1700  3    terrain where the water remains close to the surface
J10 1700 12    and where the air is dry, so that a high evaporation
J10 1710 11    leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant
J10 1720  6    growth.
