D03 0010  1       ONE HUNDRED years ago there existed in England the
D03 0010 10    Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom.
D03 0020  9    Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized
D03 0030  9    individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches, and
D03 0040  5    urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome,
D03 0050  3    this association produced little fruit, and, in fact,
D03 0050 11    was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.
D03 0060  8       Now again in 1961, in England, there is perhaps
D03 0070  5    nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed
D03 0080  2    as Christian unity. The Church Unity Octave, January
D03 0090  1    18-25, was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion
D03 0090 10    by the various churches. Many people seem hopeful,
D03 0100  6    yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there
D03 0110  5    will be any more real attainment of Christian unity
D03 0120  2    in 1961 than there was in 1861. But it must be readily
D03 0120 14    seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly
D03 0130 10    changed during these hundred years as to engender hope,
D03 0140  7    at least on the Catholic side. For the "tide is well
D03 0150  6    on the turn", as the London Catholic weekly Universe
D03 0160  2    has written.
D03 0160  4       I came to England last summer to do research on
D03 0170  4    the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman. As an American
D03 0180  2    Catholic of Irish ancestry, I came with certain preconceptions
D03 0190  1    and expectations; being intellectually influenced by
D03 0190  7    Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England,
D03 0200  9    I knew only a Protestant-dominated country. Since arriving
D03 0210  4    here, however, I have formed a far different religious
D03 0220  5    picture of present-day England. In representing part
D03 0230  2    of this new picture, I will be recounting some of my
D03 0240  1    own personal experiences, reactions and judgments;
D03 0240  7    but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen
D03 0250  6    themselves are saying and writing and implying about
D03 0260  4    the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present
D03 0261  2    religious state of England.
D03 0270  4       Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear
D03 0280  4    gray or some variant from the wholly black suit, my
D03 0280 14    Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in
D03 0290  9    England as a Roman Catholic cleric. In any case, I
D03 0300  7    have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by
D03 0310  4    Englishmen, even in Devonshire and Cornwall, where
D03 0320  1    anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest
D03 0320  9    and longest.
D03 0330  1       Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism.
D03 0340  1    On my first Guy Fawkes Day here, I found Catholics
D03 0340 11    as well as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional
D03 0350  8    fireworks and bonfires, and was told that most Englishmen
D03 0360  7    either do not know or are not concerned with the historical
D03 0370  5    significance of the day. A Birmingham newspaper printed
D03 0380  3    in a column for children an article entitled "The True
D03 0390  2    Story of Guy Fawkes", which began:
D03 0390  8       "When you pile your "guy" on the bonfire tomorrow
D03 0410  6    night, I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes
D03 0420  6    you will remember? In the 355 years since the first
D03 0430  3    Guy Fawkes Night, much of the story has been forgotten,
D03 0440  1    so here is a reminder". The article proceeded to give
D03 0440 11    an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King
D03 0450  9    James I.
D03 0450 11    ##
D03 0450 12    IN SPITE OF the increase in numbers and prestige brought
D03 0460 10    about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians
D03 0470  7    of the 1840's and 1850's, the Catholic segment of England
D03 0480  6    one hundred years ago was a very small one (four per
D03 0490  5    cent, or 800,000) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing
D03 0500  2    from the general public. The return of the Catholic
D03 0500 11    hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation
D03 0510  9    and, in fact, was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty.
D03 0520  9    In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia
D03 0530  6    with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and
D03 0540  6    to command a fair hearing from English readers.
D03 0560  1       Now, in 1961, the Catholic population of England
D03 0560  9    is still quite small (ten per cent, or 5 million);
D03 0570  9    yet it represents a very considerable percentage of
D03 0580  4    the churchgoing population. A Protestant woman marveled
D03 0590  3    to me over the large crowds going in and out of the
D03 0590 15    Birmingham Oratory (Catholic) Church on Sunday mornings.
D03 0600  7    She found this a marvel because, as she said, only
D03 0610  9    six per cent of English people are churchgoers. She
D03 0620  4    may not have been exact on this number, but others
D03 0630  2    here feel quite certain that the percentage would be
D03 0630 11    less than ten. From many sides come remarks that Protestant
D03 0640  9    churches are badly attended and the large medieval
D03 0650  6    cathedrals look all but empty during services. A Catholic
D03 0660  4    priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large
D03 0670  3    city university, following Anglican evensong, at which
D03 0670 10    there was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated Mass
D03 0680  9    before more than a hundred.
D03 0690  2       The Protestants themselves are the first to admit
D03 0690 10    the great falling off in effective membership in their
D03 0700  9    churches. According to a newspaper report of the 1961
D03 0710  8    statistics of the Church of England, the "total of
D03 0720  4    confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671
D03 0730  1    are registered on the parochial church rolls", and
D03 0730  9    "over 27 million people in England are baptized into
D03 0740  7    the Church of England, but roughly only a tenth of
D03 0750  6    them continue". An amazing article in the Manchester
D03 0760  2    Guardian of last November, entitled "Fate of Redundant
D03 0770  1    Churches", states than an Archbishops' Commission "reported
D03 0780  1    last month that in the Church of England alone there
D03 0780 11    are 790 churches which are redundant now, or will be
D03 0790  9    in 20 years' time. A further 260 Anglican churches
D03 0800  4    have been demolished since 1948". And in the last five
D03 0810  5    years, the "Methodist chapel committee has authorized
D03 0820  1    the demolition or, more often, the sale of 764 chapels".
D03 0820 11    Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses,
D03 0830  9    but "neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to
D03 0840  4    selling churches to Roman Catholics", and have done
D03 0850  4    so.
D03 0850  5       While it must be said that these same Protestants
D03 0860  2    have built some new churches during this period, and
D03 0860 11    that religious population shifts have emptied churches,
D03 0870  7    a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy
D03 0880  6    is that fewer Protestants are going to church. It should
D03 0890  6    be admitted, too, that there is a good percentage of
D03 0900  3    lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics (one paper writes
D03 0900 10    50 per cent). Still, it is clear from such reports,
D03 0910 10    and apparently clear from the remarks of many people,
D03 0920  7    that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing.
D03 0930  3       An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly
D03 0940  3    acknowledged to me that this is true. A century ago,
D03 0950  1    Newman saw that liberalism (what we now might call
D03 0950 10    secularism) would gradually but definitely make its
D03 0960  6    mark on English Protestantism, and that even high Anglicanism
D03 0970  5    would someday no longer be a "serviceable breakwater
D03 0980  2    against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its
D03 0980  9    own". That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems
D03 0990 10    no longer very meaningful to call England a "Protestant
D03 1000  6    country". One of the ironies of the present crusade
D03 1010  5    for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively
D03 1020  1    speaking, many real Christians to unite.
D03 1020  7       Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism
D03 1030  7    and know that they are in a new ascendancy. The London
D03 1040  7    Universe devoted its centenary issue last December
D03 1050  3    8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress
D03 1060  1    during the last one hundred years. With traditional
D03 1060  9    nationalistic spirit, some Englishmen claim that English
D03 1070  6    Catholicism is Catholicism at its best. I have found
D03 1080  7    myself saying with other foreigners here that English
D03 1090  3    Catholics are good Catholics. It has been my experience
D03 1100  1    to find as many men as women in church, and to hear
D03 1100 13    almost everyone in church congregations reciting the
D03 1110  6    Latin prayers and responses at Mass.
D03 1120  3       They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic
D03 1130  1    population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday
D03 1130 10    Benediction they recite by heart the "Prayer for England":
D03 1140  9       "O Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most
D03 1150  9    gentle queen and mother, look down in mercy upon England,
D03 1160  7    thy "dowry", and upon us all who greatly hope and trust
D03 1170  7    in thee ... Intercede for our separated brethren,
D03 1180  2    that with us in the one true fold they may be united
D03 1180 14    to the chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son ...". A
D03 1190 10    hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is "Faith
D03 1200  7    of our Fathers", which glories in England's ancient
D03 1210  4    faith that endured persecution, and which proclaims:
D03 1220  2    "Faith of our Fathers: Mary's prayers/Shall win our
D03 1230  2    country back to thee". The English saints are widely
D03 1230 11    venerated, quite naturally, and now there is great
D03 1240  8    hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will
D03 1250  5    soon be canonized.
D03 1250  8       Because they have kept the faith of their medieval
D03 1260  8    fathers, English Catholics have always strongly resented
D03 1270  4    the charge of being "un-English". I have not seen this
D03 1280  5    charge made during my stay here, but apparently it
D03 1290  1    is still in the air. For example, a writer in a recent
D03 1290 13    number of The Queen hyperbolically states that "of
D03 1300  6    the myriad imprecations the only one which the English
D03 1310  6    Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they
D03 1320  3    are 'un-English'". In this connection, it has been
D03 1330  1    observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics,
D03 1330  9    priests and laity, in England, while certainly seen
D03 1340  7    as good for Catholicism, is nevertheless a source of
D03 1350  6    embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English
D03 1360  2    Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to
D03 1360  9    remind their Christian brethren of this good.
D03 1370  7    ##
D03 1370  8    ONE OF THE more noteworthy changes that have taken
D03 1380  7    place since the mid-19th century is the situation of
D03 1390  5    Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. At
D03 1400  2    Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics,
D03 1410  1    partly because religious tests were removed only in
D03 1410  9    1854. Moreover, for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical
D03 1420  9    representation in the city to care for their religious
D03 1430  7    needs. Now, not only are there considerably more laity
D03 1440  3    as students and professors at Oxford, but there are
D03 1450  2    also numerous houses of religious orders existing in
D03 1450 10    respectable and friendly relations with the non-Catholic
D03 1460  8    members of the University. Some Catholic priests lecture
D03 1470  5    there; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row
D03 1480  4    on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students.
D03 1490  1       Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a
D03 1490  8    more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful
D03 1500  9    attention given to it in the mass media of England.
D03 1510  7    The general tone of articles appearing in such important
D03 1520  4    newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday
D03 1530  2    Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic
D03 1540  1    Church is now at least of equal stature in England
D03 1540 11    with the Protestant churches. On successive Sundays
D03 1550  5    during October, 1960, Paul Ferris (a non-Catholic)
D03 1560  4    wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen
D03 1570  2    of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the
D03 1570 13    Nonconformist Church. The Catholic priest, though somewhat
D03 1580  7    superficially drawn, easily came out the best. There
D03 1590  8    were many letters of strong protest against the portrait
D03 1600  5    of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed portrayed
D03 1610  2    as a man not particularly concerned with religious
D03 1610 10    matters and without really very much to do as clergyman.
D03 1620 10    Such a series of articles was certainly never printed
D03 1630  6    in the public press of mid-Victorian England. There
D03 1640  3    was so much interest shown in this present-day venture
D03 1650  2    that it was continued on B.B.C., where comments were
D03 1660  1    equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister
D03 1660 11    and a Catholic priest.
D03 1670  2       Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television
D03 1680  2    programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith
D03 1680  8    on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen. A notable
D03 1690  7    example of this was the discussion of Christian unity
D03 1700  6    by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Dr. Heenan,
D03 1710  3    and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr. Ramsey, recently
D03 1720  3    appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The good feeling
D03 1730  2    which exists between these two important church figures
D03 1730 10    is now well known in England. The Holy Sacrifice of
D03 1740  9    the Mass with commentary has been televised several
D03 1750  5    times in recent months. And it was interesting to observe
D03 1760  4    that B.B.C.'s television film on Christmas Eve was
D03 1770  3    The Bells of St. Mary's.
D03 1770  8       Of course, the crowning event that has dramatically
D03 1780  7    upset the traditional pattern of English religious
D03 1790  4    history was the friendly visit paid by Dr. Fisher,
D03 1800  2    then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican
D03 1810  1    last December. It was the first time an English Primate
D03 1810 11    has done this since the 14th century. English Catholics
D03 1820  8    reacted to this event with moderate but real hope.
D03 1830  6       Almost daily something is reported which feeds this
D03 1840  4    Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing
D03 1850  1    numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants;
D03 1850  8    news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has
D03 1860  8    offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his
D03 1870  6    pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested
D03 1880  4    to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during
D03 1890  1    the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement
D03 1890 11    in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the
D03 1900  7    present system is still in operation, will constitute
D03 1910  5    almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next
D03 1920  4    generation"; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen
D03 1930  1    and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian
D03 1930 10    unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church
D03 1940  9    Unity Octave.
