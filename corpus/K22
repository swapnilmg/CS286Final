K22 0010  1       I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who
K22 0010 12    begin each morning by exclaiming, "O Gogol, O Chekhov,
K22 0020  7    O Thackeray and Dickens, what would you have made of
K22 0030  7    a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris
K22 0031  4    ducks, a birdbath, and three composition gnomes with
K22 0050  1    long beards and red mobcaps"? As I say, I wouldn't
K22 0050 11    want to begin a day like this, but I often wonder what
K22 0060 11    the dead would have done. But the shelter is as much
K22 0070  7    a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut
K22 0080  3    trees that grow on the ridge. I can see it from this
K22 0090  1    window where I write. It was built by the Pasterns,
K22 0090 11    and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property.
K22 0100  9    It bulks under a veil of thin, new grass, like some
K22 0110  6    embarrassing fact of physicalness, and I think Mrs.
K22 0120  3    Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning.
K22 0120 12    It would have been like her. She was a pale woman.
K22 0130 11    Sitting on her terrace, sitting in her parlor, sitting
K22 0140  6    anywhere, she ground an axe of self-esteem. Offer her
K22 0150  3    a cup of tea and she would say, "Why, these cups look
K22 0160  2    just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year".
K22 0170  1    Show her the new swimming pool and she would say, slapping
K22 0170 12    her ankle, "I suppose this must be where you breed
K22 0180  9    your gigantic mosquitoes". Hand her a chair and she
K22 0190  7    would say, "Why, it's a nice imitation of those Queen
K22 0200  4    Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy".
K22 0210  1    These trumps were more touching than they were anything
K22 0210 10    else, and seemed to imply that the nights were long,
K22 0220 10    her children ungrateful, and her marriage bewilderingly
K22 0230  5    threadbare. Twenty years ago, she would have been known
K22 0240  4    as a golf widow, and the sum of her manner was perhaps
K22 0250  1    one of bereavement. She usually wore weeds, and a stranger
K22 0250 11    watching her board a train might have guessed that
K22 0260  9    Mr. Pastern was dead, but Mr. Pastern was far from
K22 0270  7    dead. He was marching up and down the locker room of
K22 0280  5    the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting, "Bomb Cuba! Bomb
K22 0290  2    Berlin! Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them
K22 0300  1    and show them who's boss". He was brigadier of the
K22 0300 11    club's locker-room light infantry, and at one time
K22 0310  7    or another declared war on Russia, Czechoslovakia,
K22 0320  2    Yugoslavia, and China.
K22 0320  5       It all began on an autumn afternoon- and who, after
K22 0330  8    all these centuries, can describe the fineness of an
K22 0340  5    autumn day? One might pretend never to have seen one
K22 0350  3    before, or, to more purpose, that there would never
K22 0350 12    be another like it. The clear and searching sweep of
K22 0360  9    sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights.
K22 0370  7    Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled,
K22 0380  4    for all its ammoniac acidity, of beginnings. The boundless
K22 0390  2    blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin
K22 0390 12    of a drum. Leaving her house one late afternoon, Mrs.
K22 0400  8    Pastern stopped to admire the October light. It was
K22 0410  7    the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis. Mrs. Pastern
K22 0420  4    had been given sixteen names, a bundle of literature,
K22 0430  2    and a printed book of receipts. It was her work to
K22 0430 13    go among her neighbors and collect their checks. Her
K22 0440  8    house stood on a rise of ground, and before she got
K22 0450  7    into her car she looked at the houses below. Charity
K22 0460  2    as she knew it was complex and reciprocal, and almost
K22 0460 12    every roof she saw signified charity. Mrs. Balcolm
K22 0470  8    worked for the brain. Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health.
K22 0480  7    Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind. Mrs. Horowitz
K22 0490  5    was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat. Mrs.
K22 0500  4    Trempler was tuberculosis, Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers'
K22 0510  2    March of Dimes, Mrs. Craven was cancer, and Mrs. Gilkson
K22 0520  2    did the kidney. Mrs. Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league,
K22 0521  1    Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis, and way in the distance
K22 0530  9    could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton's house,
K22 0540  6    a roof that signified gout.
K22 0550  1       Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house
K22 0550 10    to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest
K22 0560  8    and traditional laborer. It was her destiny; it was
K22 0570  7    her life. Her mother had done it before her, and even
K22 0580  4    her old grandmother, who had collected money for smallpox
K22 0590  1    and unwed mothers. Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most
K22 0590  9    of her neighbors in advance, and most of them were
K22 0600  8    ready for her. She experienced none of the suspense
K22 0610  5    of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias. Here and
K22 0620  2    there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry.
K22 0620 13    The contributions were ahead of what she had got the
K22 0630  9    previous year, and while the money, of course, was
K22 0640  6    not hers, it excited her to stuff her kit with big
K22 0650  3    checks. She stopped at the Surcliffes' after dusk,
K22 0650 11    and had a Scotch-and-soda. She stayed too late, and
K22 0660 10    when she left, it was dark and time to go home and
K22 0670  8    cook supper for her husband. "I got a hundred and sixty
K22 0680  4    dollars for the hepatitis fund", she said excitedly
K22 0690  1    when he walked in. "I did everybody on my list but
K22 0690 12    the Blevins and the Flannagans. I want to get my kit
K22 0700 10    in tomorrow morning- would you mind doing them while
K22 0710  6    I cook the dinner"?
K22 0710 10       "But I don't know the Flannagans", Charlie Pastern
K22 0720  7    said.
K22 0720  8       "Nobody does, but they gave me ten last year".
K22 0730  9       He was tired, he had his business worries, and the
K22 0740  7    sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler
K22 0750  4    only seemed like an extension of a boring day. He was
K22 0760  2    happy enough to take the convertible and race up the
K22 0760 12    hill to the Blevins', thinking that they might give
K22 0770  7    him a drink. But the Blevins were away; their maid
K22 0780  5    gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the
K22 0790  3    door. Turning in at the Flannagans' driveway, he tried
K22 0800  1    to remember if he had ever met them. The name encouraged
K22 0800 12    him, because he always felt that he could handle the
K22 0810  9    Irish. There was a glass pane in the front door, and
K22 0820  7    through this he could see into a hallway where a plump
K22 0830  4    woman with red hair was arranging flowers.
K22 0830 11       "Infectious hepatitis", he shouted heartily.
K22 0840  5       She took a good look at herself in the mirror before
K22 0850  7    she turned and, walking with very small steps, started
K22 0860  4    toward the door. "Oh, please come in", she said. The
K22 0870  2    girlish voice was nearly a whisper. She was not a girl,
K22 0870 13    he could see. Her hair was dyed, and her bloom was
K22 0880 11    fading, and she must have been crowding forty, but
K22 0890  6    she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the
K22 0900  4    manners and graces of a pretty child of eight. "Your
K22 0900 14    wife just called", she said, separating one word from
K22 0910  9    another, exactly like a child. "And I am not sure that
K22 0920 10    I have any cash- any money, that is- but if you will
K22 0930  7    wait just a minute I will write you out a check if
K22 0940  5    I can find my checkbook. Won't you step into the living
K22 0950  2    room, where it's cozier"?
K22 0950  6       A fire had just been lighted, he saw, and things
K22 0960  5    had been set out for drinks, and, like any stray, his
K22 0970  3    response to these comforts was instantaneous. Where
K22 0970 10    was Mr. Flannagan, he wondered. Travelling home on
K22 0980  7    a late train? Changing his clothes upstairs? Taking
K22 0990  6    a shower? At the end of the room there was a desk heaped
K22 1000  7    with papers, and she began to riffle these, making
K22 1010  2    sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation. "I am
K22 1010 11    terribly sorry to keep you waiting", she said, "but
K22 1020  9    won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait?
K22 1030  8    Everything's on the table".
K22 1040  1       "What train does Mr. Flannagan come out on"?
K22 1050  1       "Mr. Flannagan is away", she said. Her voice dropped.
K22 1060  1    "Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks ...".
K22 1060 10       "I'll have a drink, then, if you'll have one with
K22 1070 10    me".
K22 1070 11       "If you will promise to make it weak".
K22 1080  8       "Sit down", he said, "and enjoy your drink and look
K22 1090  7    for your checkbook later. The only way to find things
K22 1100  5    is to relax".
K22 1100  8       All in all, they had six drinks. She described herself
K22 1110  4    and her circumstances unhesitatingly. Mr. Flannagan
K22 1120  2    manufactured plastic tongue depressors. He travelled
K22 1130  1    all over the world. She didn't like to travel. Planes
K22 1130 11    made her feel faint, and in Tokyo, where she had gone
K22 1140  9    that summer, she had been given raw fish for breakfast
K22 1150  5    and so she had come straight home. She and her husband
K22 1160  3    had formerly lived in New York, where she had many
K22 1160 13    friends, but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would
K22 1170  8    be safer in case of war. She would rather live in danger
K22 1180  9    than die of loneliness and boredom. She had no children;
K22 1190  5    she had made no friends. "I've seen you, though, before",
K22 1200  4    she said with enormous coyness, patting his knee. "I've
K22 1210  3    seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by
K22 1220  1    in the convertible ...".
K22 1220  5       The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her
K22 1230  3    window touched him, although he was even more touched
K22 1230 12    by her plumpness. Sheer plumpness, he knew, is not
K22 1240  9    a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions.
K22 1250  7    It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest
K22 1260  5    of the carcass. And knowing its humble place in the
K22 1270  2    scale of things, why did he, at this time of life,
K22 1270 13    seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness? The
K22 1280  8    remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman
K22 1290  5    seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to
K22 1300  4    make of them, but after the sixth drink he put his
K22 1300 15    arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs
K22 1310  8    and look for her checkbook there.
K22 1320  2       "I've never done this before", she said later, when
K22 1330  2    he was arranging himself to leave. Her voice shook
K22 1330 11    with feeling, and he thought it lovely. He didn't doubt
K22 1340  9    her truthfulness, although he had heard the words a
K22 1350  7    hundred times. "I've never done this before", they
K22 1360  3    always said, shaking their dresses down over their
K22 1360 11    white shoulders. "I've never done this before", they
K22 1370  8    always said, waiting for the elevator in the hotel
K22 1380  8    corridor. "I've never done this before", they always
K22 1390  5    said, pouring another whiskey. "I've never done this
K22 1400  4    before", they always said, putting on their stockings.
K22 1420  1    On ships at sea, on railroad trains, in summer hotels
K22 1420 11    with mountain views, they always said, "I've never
K22 1430  6    done this before".
K22 1430  9    ##
K22 1430 10    "Where have you been"? Mrs. Pastern asked sadly, when
K22 1440  9    he came in. "It's after eleven".
K22 1450  5       "I had a drink with the Flannagans".
K22 1460  1       "She told me he was in Germany".
K22 1460  8       "He came home unexpectedly".
K22 1470  4       Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went
K22 1480  4    into the TV room to hear the news. "Bomb them"! he
K22 1490  2    shouted. "Throw a little nuclear hardware at them!
K22 1490 10    Show them who's boss"! But in bed he had trouble sleeping.
K22 1500 11    He thought first of his son and daughter, away at college.
K22 1510 10    He loved them. It was the only meaning of the word
K22 1520  9    that he had ever known. Then he played nine imaginary
K22 1530  4    holes of golf, choosing his handicap, his irons, his
K22 1540  2    stance, his opponents, and his weather in detail, but
K22 1540 11    the green of the links seemed faded in the light of
K22 1550  9    his business worries. His money was tied up in a Nassau
K22 1560  7    hotel, an Ohio pottery works, and a detergent for window-washing,
K22 1570  4    and luck had been running against him. His worries
K22 1580  2    harried him up out of bed, and he lighted a cigarette
K22 1580 13    and went to the window. In the starlight he could see
K22 1590 10    the trees stripped of their leaves. During the summer
K22 1600  5    he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track,
K22 1610  4    and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel
K22 1620  1    tickets would still be lying, like leaves, in the gutters
K22 1620 11    near Belmont and Saratoga. Maple and ash, beech and
K22 1630  8    elm, one hundred to win on Three in the fourth, fifty
K22 1640  6    to win on Six in the third, one hundred to win on Two
K22 1650  5    in the eighth. Children walking home from school would
K22 1660  1    scuff through what seemed to be his foliage. Then,
K22 1660 10    getting back into bed, he thought unashamedly of Mrs.
K22 1670  7    Flannagan, planning where they would next meet and
K22 1680  5    what they would do. There are, he thought, so few true
K22 1690  2    means of forgetfulness in this life that why should
K22 1690 11    he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed,
K22 1700  7    as it did, a little crude?
