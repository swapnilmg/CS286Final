J54 0010  1    Whenever artists, indeed, turned to actual representations
J54 0010  8    or molded three-dimensional figures, which were rare
J54 0020  7    down to 800 B.C., they tended to reflect reality (see
J54 0030  6    Plate 6a, 9b); a schematic, abstract treatment of
J54 0040  4    men and animals, by intent, rose only in the late eighth
J54 0050  3    century.
J54 0050  4       To speak of this underlying view of the world is
J54 0060  3    to embark upon matters of subjective judgment. At the
J54 0060 12    least, however, one may conclude that Geometric potters
J54 0070  8    sensed a logical order; their principles of composition
J54 0080  5    stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric
J54 0090  5    epics and the hexameter line. Their world, again, was
J54 0100  2    a still simple, traditional age which was only slowly
J54 0100 11    beginning to appreciate the complexity of life. And
J54 0110  8    perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far
J54 0120  7    in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users
J54 0130  3    was basically stable and secure. The storms of the
J54 0130 12    past had died away, and the great upheaval which was
J54 0140 10    to mark the following century had not yet begun to
J54 0150  7    disturb men's minds.
J54 0150 10       Throughout the work of the later ninth century a
J54 0160  9    calm, severe serenity displays itself. In the vases
J54 0170  5    this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one
J54 0180  2    in its internal self-satisfaction, but the best of
J54 0180 11    the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among
J54 0190  7    the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world. The
J54 0200  6    ninth century was in its artistic work "the spiritually
J54 0210  2    freest and most self-sufficient between past and future",
J54 0220  1    and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their
J54 0220 11    products is a testimonial to their sense that what
J54 0230  7    they were doing was important and was appreciated.
J54 0240  3    _THE AEGEAN IN 800 B.C._
J54 0240  8       GEOMETRIC POTTERY has not yet received the thorough,
J54 0250  7    detailed study which it deserves, partly because the
J54 0270  4    task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its
J54 0280  3    local manifestations, as at Argos, are only now coming
J54 0280 12    to light. From even a cursory inspection of its many
J54 0290  9    aspects, however, the historian can deduce several
J54 0300  5    fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean
J54 0310  4    world down to 800 B.C.
J54 0310  9       The general intellectual outlook which had appeared
J54 0320  5    in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant
J54 0330  4    degree. Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become
J54 0340  3    reasonably well developed by 800. In this process the
J54 0340 12    Minoan-Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or
J54 0350  6    finally rejected; the Aegean world which had existed
J54 0360  7    before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly
J54 0380  4    in our vision after 800. Those modern scholars who
J54 0390  2    urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity
J54 0390 12    of Aegean development from earliest times- granted
J54 0400  6    occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside-
J54 0410  6    are correct; but all too many observers have been misled
J54 0420  4    by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which
J54 0430  2    took place in the early first millennium.
J54 0430  9       The focus of novelty in this world now lay in the
J54 0440 10    south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland, and
J54 0450  4    by 800 virtually the entire Aegean, always excepting
J54 0460  1    its northern shores, had accepted the Geometric style
J54 0460  9    of pottery. While Protogeometric vases usually turn
J54 0470  6    up, especially outside Greece proper, together with
J54 0480  4    as many or more examples of local stamp, these "non-Greek"
J54 0490  1    patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.
J54 0500  1    In their place came local variations within the common
J54 0500 10    style- tentative, as it were, in Protogeometric products
J54 0510 10    but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric
J54 0520  7    spirit developed. Attica, though important, was not
J54 0530  5    the only teacher of this age. One can take a vase of
J54 0540  4    about 800 B.C. and, without any knowledge of its place
J54 0550  1    of origin, venture to assign it to a specific area;
J54 0550 11    imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable.
J54 0560  6    The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart
J54 0570  5    from those of the mainland, and in Greece itself Argive,
J54 0580  3    Corinthian, Attic, Boeotian, and other Geometric sequences
J54 0590  2    have each their own hallmarks. These local variations
J54 0590 10    were to become ever sharper in the next century and
J54 0600 10    a half.
J54 0600 12       The same conclusions can be drawn from the other
J54 0610  8    physical evidence of the Dark ages, from linguistic
J54 0620  4    distribution, and from the survivals of early social,
J54 0630  2    political, and religious patterns into later ages.
J54 0630  9    By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue
J54 0640  9    and of common culture. On these pillars rested that
J54 0650  6    solid basis for life and thought which was soon to
J54 0660  4    be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the
J54 0660 13    Iliad. Everywhere within the common pattern, however,
J54 0670  7    one finds local diversity; Greek history and culture
J54 0680  6    were enduringly fertilized, and plagued, by the interplay
J54 0690  6    of these conjoined yet opposed factors.
J54 0700  1       Further we cannot go, for the Dark ages deserve
J54 0700 10    their name. Many aspects of civilization were not yet
J54 0710  9    sufficiently crystallized to find expression, nor could
J54 0720  6    the simple economic and social foundations of this
J54 0730  3    world support a lofty structure. The epic poems, the
J54 0750  1    consolidation of the Greek pantheon, the rise of firm
J54 0750 10    political units, the self-awareness which could permit
J54 0760  7    painted and sculptured representations of men- all
J54 0770  4    these had to await the progress of following decades.
J54 0780  1    What we have seen in this chapter, we have seen only
J54 0780 12    dimly, and yet the results, however general, are worth
J54 0790  8    the search. These are the centuries in which the inhabitants
J54 0800  7    of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds
J54 0810  4    and into their institutions the foundations of the
J54 0820  1    Hellenic outlook, independent of outside forces.
J54 0820  7       To interpret, indeed, the era from 1000 to 800 as
J54 0830  9    a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary
J54 0840  5    but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed
J54 0850  1    information; if we could see more deeply, we probably
J54 0850 10    would find many side issues and wrong turnings which
J54 0860  8    came to an end within the period. The historian can
J54 0870  5    only point out those lines which were major enough
J54 0880  2    to find reflection in our limited evidence, and must
J54 0880 11    hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding.
J54 0890  7    Throughout the Dark ages, it is clear, the Greek world
J54 0900  8    had been developing slowly but consistently. The pace
J54 0910  4    could now be accelerated, for the inhabitants of the
J54 0920  3    Aegean stood on firm ground.
J54 0920  8    #CHAPTER 5 THE EARLY EIGHTH CENTURY#
J54 0930  1    THE LANDSCAPE of Greek history broadens widely, and
J54 0940  1    rather abruptly, in the eighth century B.C., the age
J54 0940 10    of Homer's "rosy-fingered Dawn". The first slanting
J54 0950  7    rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark
J54 0960  7    shadows which lie across the Aegean world; but our
J54 0970  3    evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more
J54 0980  1    unmistakably some of the lines of change. For this
J54 0980 10    period, as for earlier centuries, pottery remains the
J54 0990  5    most secure source; the ceramic material of the age
J54 1000  5    is more abundant, more diversified, and more indicative
J54 1010  1    of the hopes and fears of its makers, who begin to
J54 1010 12    show scenes of human life and death. Figurines and
J54 1020  7    simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and
J54 1030  4    architecture in Greece; objects in gold, ivory, and
J54 1050  2    bronze grow more numerous. Since writing was practiced
J54 1050 10    in the Aegean before the end of the century, we may
J54 1060 10    hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally
J54 1070  6    useful. Though it is not easy to apply the evidence
J54 1080  4    of the Iliad to any specific era, this marvelous product
J54 1090  2    of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive
J54 1090 10    shape by 750.
J54 1100  3       The Dipylon Geometric pottery of Athens and the
J54 1100 11    Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities
J54 1110  8    of Greek civilization; but both were among the last
J54 1120  8    products of a phase which was ending. Greek civilization
J54 1130  6    was swirling toward its great revolution, in which
J54 1140  3    the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were
J54 1150  1    suddenly to break forth. The revolution was well under
J54 1150 10    way before 700 B.C., and premonitory signs go back
J54 1160  8    virtually across the century. The era, however, is
J54 1170  5    Janus-faced. While many tokens point forward, the main
J54 1180  3    achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns
J54 1190  1    of the Dark ages. The dominant pottery of the century
J54 1190 11    was Geometric; political organization revolved about
J54 1200  5    the basileis; trade was just beginning to expand; the
J54 1220  7    gods who protected the Greek countryside were only
J54 1230  3    now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.
J54 1240  1       The modern student, who knows what was to come next,
J54 1240 11    is likely to place first the factors of change which
J54 1250  9    are visible in the eighth century. Not all men of the
J54 1260  7    period would have accepted this emphasis. Many potters
J54 1270  3    clung to the past the more determinedly as they were
J54 1270 13    confronted with radically new ideas; the poet of the
J54 1280  9    Iliad deliberately archaized. Although it is not possible
J54 1290  7    to sunder old and new in this era, I shall consider
J54 1300  7    in the present chapter primarily the first decades
J54 1320  2    of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an
J54 1320 12    apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization.
J54 1330  8       On this principle of division I must postpone the
J54 1340  7    evolution of sculpture, architecture, society, and
J54 1350  3    politics; for the developments in these areas make
J54 1350 11    sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution
J54 1360 11    itself. The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient
J54 1370  6    are also a phase which should be linked primarily to
J54 1380  5    the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after
J54 1390  2    750. We shall not be able entirely to pass over these
J54 1390 13    connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric
J54 1400  9    pottery, the epic and the myth, and the religious evolution
J54 1410  8    of early Greece; the important point, however, is that
J54 1420  5    these magnificent achievements, unlike those of later
J54 1430  3    decades, were only incidentally influenced by Oriental
J54 1440  1    models. The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the
J54 1440 10    Iliad lie in the Aegean past.
J54 1450  4    _DIPYLON POTTERY_
J54 1450  6       THE POTTERY of the first half of the eighth century
J54 1460  6    is commonly called Ripe Geometric. The severe yet harmonious
J54 1470  4    vases of the previous fifty years, the Strong Geometric
J54 1480  2    style of the late ninth century, display as firm a
J54 1480 12    mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery;
J54 1490  7    but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate
J54 1500  6    their inheritance. The vases which resulted had different
J54 1510  3    shapes, far more complex decoration, and a larger sense
J54 1520  2    of style.
J54 1520  4       Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this
J54 1530  2    expansion we must consider the change in pottery style
J54 1530 11    on broader lines. In earlier centuries men had had
J54 1540  8    enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order
J54 1550  6    after chaos. They had had to work on very simple foundations
J54 1560  3    and had not dared to give rein to impulses. The potters,
J54 1570  2    in particular, had virtually eschewed freehand drawing,
J54 1570  9    elaborate motifs, and the curving lines of nature,
J54 1580  8    while yet expressing a belief that there was order
J54 1590  6    in the universe. In their vases were embodied the basic
J54 1600  3    aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization,
J54 1610  1    at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work, and then
J54 1610  9    more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric
J54 1620  8    style. By 800 social and cultural security had been
J54 1630  6    achieved, at least on a simple plane; it was time to
J54 1640  5    take bigger steps, to venture on experiments.
J54 1650  1       Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old
J54 1650  8    syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the
J54 1660  8    well-defined though limited range of motifs which they
J54 1670  4    had inherited. In these respects the vases of the early
J54 1680  1    eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines
J54 1680  9    of progress. To the ancestral lore, however, new materials
J54 1690  8    were added. Painters left less and less of a vase in
J54 1700  9    a plain dark color; instead they divided the surface
J54 1710  4    into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns
J54 1720  1    into which freehand drawing began to creep. Wavy lines,
J54 1720 10    feather-like patterns, rosettes of indefinitely floral
J54 1730  6    nature, birds either singly or in stylized rows, animals
J54 1740  6    in solemn frieze bands (see Plates 11-12)- all these
J54 1750  5    turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary
J54 1760  1    signs that the potters were broadening their gaze.
J54 1760  9    The rows of animals and birds, in particular, suggest
J54 1770  6    awareness of Oriental animal friezes, transmitted perhaps
J54 1780  3    via Syrian silver bowls and textiles, but the specific
J54 1790  2    forms of these rows on local vases and metal products
J54 1790 12    are nonetheless Greek. Though the spread of this type
J54 1800  9    of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely
J54 1810  7    determined, it seems to appear first in the Cyclades,
J54 1820  4    which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout
J54 1830  2    the century.
J54 1830  4       As the material at the command of the potters grew
J54 1840  3    and the volume of their production increased, the local
J54 1850  1    variations within a common style became more evident.
J54 1850  9    Plate 12 illustrates four examples, which are Ripe
J54 1860  6    or Late Geometric work of common spirit but of different
J54 1870  5    schools.
