N06 0010  1    Such was my state of mind that I did not question the
N06 0010 13    possibility of this; under the circumstances I was
N06 0020  7    only too willing to confess all. I was nearly thirty
N06 0030  5    at the time.
N06 0030  8       I went to the hall in the afternoons only, on these
N06 0040  5    preliminary matters. It was dark and, I sensed, very
N06 0050  2    large; only the counter at one end was lighted by a
N06 0050 13    long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it.
N06 0060  7    Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the
N06 0070  7    darkness. I would turn away from my writing in the
N06 0090  3    hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite
N06 0090 15    succeeded. A glimpse of three of four vague figures,
N06 0100  9    at the most. Drifting here and there. Squatting, as
N06 0110  6    if waiting. The pulsing glow of a cigarette. Since
N06 0120  4    they could see me but I not them, their presence in
N06 0130  2    the hall disturbed me. The clerk paid them no attention.
N06 0130 12    This impressed me, until I realized how limited was
N06 0140  8    his sphere of influence. His job simply consisted in
N06 0150  6    registering new men. When the phone rang he answered
N06 0160  3    it. His authority extended to the far edge of the counter,
N06 0170  1    no further. None of the men hanging around the hall
N06 0170 11    bothered to speak to him. Baldness was attacking his
N06 0180  7    pate. He spoke to me in a gruff voice, an affectation
N06 0190  4    which quite belied his personality. He wore his white
N06 0200  3    shirt open at the neck, revealing a bit of scrawny
N06 0200 13    pale chest underneath. It was obvious that he wished
N06 0210  8    himself different from the sort of person he thought
N06 0220  6    he was. But it was not easy for him and he often slipped.
N06 0230  3    When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the
N06 0240  1    floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle
N06 0240 11    I noticed how the clerk winced. I felt certain he was
N06 0250  8    really a spineless little man. His hat (the cause of
N06 0260  6    his baldness?) hung on a hook on the wall, and underneath
N06 0270  2    it I could see his tie, knotted, ready to be slipped
N06 0270 13    over his head, a black badge of frayed respectability
N06 0280  9    that ought never to have left his neck. The morning's
N06 0290  7    tabloids were on the counter, and a stack of dog-eared
N06 0300  6    men's magazines. On a shelf in the office behind the
N06 0310  2    counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station
N06 0310 12    which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular
N06 0320  8    music. Everything about the clerk was trivial. Once,
N06 0330  7    pressing him, I learned that his job was only part-time,
N06 0340  6    in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall.
N06 0350  2    Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage
N06 0350  9    what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still
N06 0360  9    be clinging to his person. With distaste I saw him
N06 0370  6    assume a pompous air. When he saw me coming he turned
N06 0380  3    his radio off. He made a show of rearranging my forms
N06 0380 14    on the shelf. He would pick up the ringing phone with
N06 0390 11    studied negligence, then bark into it with gruff importance.
N06 0400  8    What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon
N06 0410  5    me. In the mornings, I was informed, fluorescent tubes,
N06 0420  2    similar to the one above the counter, illuminated the
N06 0420 11    entire hall. They, and the two large fans which I could
N06 0430 11    dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents,
N06 0440  6    down at the far end of the hall, could be turned on
N06 0450  5    by a master switch situated inside the office. He pointed
N06 0460  2    out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed
N06 0470  1    that he would let deed follow words. I was shown, instead,
N06 0470 12    a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out, he
N06 0480  9    told me, every morning. Now, here was something of
N06 0490  5    obvious importance to me, yet when I reached for the
N06 0500  3    tickets he snatched them away from my hand. He couldn't
N06 0500 13    afford to have anyone mess around with them, he said.
N06 0510 10    Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful
N06 0520  8    recipient. I withdrew my hand. Later I would remember
N06 0530  5    what this pompous little man had told me about the
N06 0540  2    worth of a ticket.
N06 0540  6       Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms
N06 0550  4    to be processed, I gave myself over to speculations
N06 0550 13    concerning the hall itself. When suitably lighted,
N06 0560  7    what would it look like? The presence of the two exhaust
N06 0570  7    fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become
N06 0580  4    crowded for air. One afternoon, upon receiving permission
N06 0590  1    and the necessary instructions from the clerk, I had
N06 0590 10    visited the toilet adjoining the hall. By counting
N06 0600  8    the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form
N06 0610  6    a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold
N06 0620  3    at one time. For although I had crossed a corner of
N06 0620 14    the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not
N06 0630 12    tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended.
N06 0640  7    I could observe the two fans down at the end, but their
N06 0650  6    size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I
N06 0660  3    had no measure of comparison. I had for some time been
N06 0660 14    hoping, in vain, for one of the dim figures to pass
N06 0670 11    between the fan vents and myself. I knew that three
N06 0680  6    or four of them were almost always present in the hall,
N06 0690  4    but what they were doing, and exactly where, I could
N06 0690 14    not tell. It was, I felt, possible that they were men
N06 0710 10    who, having received no tickets for that day, had remained
N06 0720  7    in the hall, to sleep perhaps, in the corners farthest
N06 0730  4    removed from the counter with its overhead light. This
N06 0740  2    light did not penetrate very far back into the hall,
N06 0740 12    and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the
N06 0750  8    dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I
N06 0760  6    tried to pick out whatever might be lying, or squatting,
N06 0770  2    on the floor below. Also the clerk appeared to disapprove
N06 0780  1    of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder.
N06 0780 10    No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter
N06 0790  9    before he would address me, at times quite sharply,
N06 0800  4    in order to bring back my attention. And I had hardly
N06 0810  2    finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned
N06 0810 11    occasion when the lights in that place, like the hall
N06 0820 10    lights controlled from the switch in the office, flicked
N06 0830  7    off and on impatiently. This sort of petty vigilance
N06 0840  4    annoyed me. I felt certain it was self-appointed. It
N06 0850  2    sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often
N06 0850 11    enough but certainly had not expected to find here.
N06 0870  8    I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing
N06 0880  6    of my papers was completed.
N06 0880 11       I felt strongly attached to the hall, however, and
N06 0890  9    hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it
N06 0900  9    from a distance. I lived in a state of suspense because
N06 0910  3    of it. I could not cling to my past nor did I wish
N06 0920  1    to. I had signed it off on the forms. My future lay
N06 0920 13    solely with the hall, yet what did I know about the
N06 0930  9    hall at this point? Although I had been inside it I
N06 0940  7    had not yet seen it functioning. I wished to prepare
N06 0950  2    myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I
N06 0950 13    ought to be wearing. I did not despair, however; far
N06 0960  9    from it! I was constantly searching for clues around
N06 0970  5    the neighborhood of the hall. Though only a relatively
N06 0980  4    short walk separated it from my own part of town, its
N06 0990  2    character was wholly foreign to me. Large warehouses
N06 0990 10    flanked the street on which the hall fronted. The river
N06 1000  9    was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of
N06 1010  6    piers prevented me from seeing it. Sometimes I noticed
N06 1020  3    the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above
N06 1020 12    the pier roofs. The sounds issuing from beyond- winches
N06 1030  9    whirring, men shouting- indicated great activity and
N06 1040  5    excited me. The hall, on the other hand, appeared lifeless
N06 1050  5    and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons. It
N06 1060  3    resembled nothing I'd ever seen before. Its front was
N06 1070  2    windowless, but irregularities in the masonry might
N06 1070  9    be an indication that windows, now blinded, had once
N06 1080  7    looked out upon the street. I kept circling the block
N06 1090  5    hoping to see, from the street behind it, the rear
N06 1100  2    of the hall. But it was not a tall structure and other
N06 1100 14    buildings concealed it. For weeks I wandered about
N06 1110  8    this neighborhood of warehouses and garages, truck
N06 1120  4    terminals and taxi repair shops, gasoline pumps and
N06 1130  2    longshoremen's lunch counters, yet never did I cease
N06 1130 10    to feel myself a stranger there.
N06 1140  5       I returned to the hall, despite my dislike for the
N06 1150  3    clerk. As I had expected, he insisted that my visits
N06 1160  1    to the hall would do nothing to further the process
N06 1160 11    of my application. Meanwhile spring had passed well
N06 1170  6    into summer. At last, when I put it to him directly,
N06 1180  5    the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my
N06 1190  1    case was unusual. When I asked him what, if anything,
N06 1190 11    I could do about it, he surprised me by referring me
N06 1200  8    to the director of the hall. I could consult this personage
N06 1210  6    on any weekday morning, though not before ten o'clock.
N06 1220  3    The clerk impressed this upon me: that I should not
N06 1230  2    arrive in the hall before ten o'clock. When I went
N06 1230 12    for my interview with the director I saw why. Although
N06 1240  8    it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had
N06 1250  7    only recently contained a great many people. Cigarette
N06 1260  2    butts littered the floor. The big fans were going,
N06 1260 11    drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke
N06 1270 10    which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling.
N06 1280  7    I had felt the draft they were making while mounting
N06 1290  4    the stairs. The staircase itself seemed still to be
N06 1300  3    echoing the heavy footfalls of many men. I stopped
N06 1300 12    by the counter. No one was behind it, but in the rear
N06 1310 10    wall of the office I noticed, for the first time, a
N06 1320  6    door which had been left partially open. Past it I
N06 1330  4    could see part of a desk, a flag in a corner, a rug
N06 1330 17    on the floor. The director's office. I rapped my knuckles
N06 1340 10    on the counter. The director came to the door. I was
N06 1350  9    at once disappointed, although just what I had expected
N06 1360  6    him to look like I could not have explained. He was
N06 1370  3    a man in his late forties, with graying hair, of medium
N06 1380  1    height; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit,
N06 1380 10    brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar. He wore
N06 1390  9    perforated, white-topped shoes; they somehow made me
N06 1400  5    expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance
N06 1410  1    routine any moment. But he came toward me sedately
N06 1410 10    enough, showed me around the counter, offered me a
N06 1420  8    seat inside his office, then walked to a file cabinet
N06 1430  5    and got out my application. I had the impression that
N06 1440  2    he had read my forms, perhaps several times. He did
N06 1440 12    not look at them now. As he lowered himself on the
N06 1450 10    chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper,
N06 1460  4    slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with
N06 1470  3    the workings of the hall. He spoke, in a voice as immaculate
N06 1480  1    as his appearance. Why had I registered? Begging my
N06 1480 10    pardon, he must express his astonishment over seeing
N06 1490  7    a person of my background applying at the hall. He
N06 1500  5    had looked over my forms and was impressed by what
N06 1510  2    he had seen there; indeed, my scholastic qualifications
N06 1510 10    were such that he, a college graduate himself, must
N06 1520  8    envy me them. Was I sure, he asked, that I knew what
N06 1530  7    I was applying for? What sort of men I would come into
N06 1540  5    contact with, at the hall? These questions did not
N06 1541  2    surprise me; I felt certain that the director, like
N06 1550  9    the afternoon clerk, seldom moved beyond the counter,
N06 1560  6    that the hall, to them, was a jungle, a dark and unwelcome
N06 1570  5    place. Though I doubted that he would understand me,
N06 1580  2    I told the director my motives for applying. I had
N06 1580 12    always, I said, hankered after working hard with my
N06 1590  8    hands. This desire, I went on, growing voluble as my
N06 1600  6    conviction was aroused, had mounted at such a rate
N06 1610  3    recently that I now found its realization necessary
N06 1610 11    not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing.
N06 1620 10    To this effect I had already severed all connections
N06 1630  6    which bound me to my former existence.
