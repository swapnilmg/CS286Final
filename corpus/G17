G17 0010  1    After only eighteen years of non-interference, there
G17 0010  9    were already indications of melioration, though "in
G17 0020  5    a slight degree", to be sure.
G17 0030  1       There were more indications by the mid-twentieth
G17 0030  9    century. I leave it to the statisticians to say what
G17 0040  8    they were, but I noticed several a few years ago, during
G17 0050  6    an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg. In
G17 0060  2    town after town my companion pointed out the Negro
G17 0060 11    school and the White school, and in every instance
G17 0070  9    the former made a better appearance (it was newer,
G17 0080  5    for one thing). It really looked as if a change of
G17 0090  3    the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been
G17 0090 12    going on. But with the renewal of interference in 1954
G17 0100 10    (as with its beginning in 1835), the improvement was
G17 0110  6    impaired.
G17 0110  7       For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that
G17 0120  6    the North was picking on them. It's infuriating, this
G17 0130  4    feeling that one is being picked on, continually, constantly.
G17 0140  2    By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask,
G17 0150  1    do the people of the North do this? The traditional
G17 0150 11    strategy of the South has been to expose the vices
G17 0160  8    of the North, to demonstrate that the North possessed
G17 0170  4    no superior virtue, to "show the world that" (as James's
G17 0180  3    Christopher Newman said to his adversaries) "however
G17 0190  1    bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it".
G17 0190 13       In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that
G17 0200 11    the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory
G17 0210  8    worker of the North. At the present time, the counter-attack
G17 0220  7    takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit
G17 0230  6    of "integration" in the North than in the South. The
G17 0240  5    line is a pretty good one.
G17 0240 11       People talk about "the law of the land". The expression
G17 0250  8    has become quite a cliche. But people can't be made
G17 0260  6    to integrate, socialize (the two are inseparable by
G17 0270  2    Southern standards) by law.
G17 0270  6       I was having lunch not long ago (apologies to N.
G17 0280  6    V. Peale) with three distinguished historians (one
G17 0290  3    specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American
G17 0300  1    history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them
G17 0300 12    if they could name instances where the general mores
G17 0310  8    had been radically changed with "deliberate speed,
G17 0320  4    majestic instancy" (Francis Thompson's words for the
G17 0330  4    Hound of Heaven's pursuit) by judicial fiat. They didn't
G17 0340  3    seem to be able to think of any.
G17 0340 11       A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist
G17 0350  9    to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable
G17 0360  5    length of time for such a change. But I suspect that
G17 0370  2    the old Roman was referring to change made under military
G17 0370 12    occupation- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking
G17 0380 11    about when he said, "They make a desert, and call it
G17 0390  9    peace" ("Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant".).
G17 0400  1       Moreover, the law of the land is not irrevocable;
G17 0410  2    it can be changed; it has been, many times. Mr. Justice
G17 0420  2    Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in
G17 0420 11    the North, and soon became a dead letter. Prohibition
G17 0430  9    was the law of the land, but it was unpopular (how
G17 0440  7    many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition
G17 0450  3    days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially
G17 0460  1    in the sophisticated Northeast!) and was repealed.
G17 0460  8    The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light
G17 0470  7    of a little history.
G17 0470 11       The Declaration of Independence says that "governments
G17 0480  7    derive their just powers from the consent of the governed".
G17 0490  9    The phrase "consent of the governed" needs a hard look.
G17 0500  8    How do we define it? Is the consent of the governed
G17 0510  5    a numerical majority? Calhoun dealt with this question
G17 0520  3    in his "Disquisition on Government".
G17 0520  8       To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority,
G17 0530  8    Calhoun developed his theory of "concurrent majority",
G17 0540  5    which, he said, "by giving to each portion of the community
G17 0550  6    which may be unequally affected by the action of government,
G17 0560  4    a negative on the others, prevents all partial or local
G17 0570  3    legislation". Who will say that our country is even
G17 0570 12    now a homogeneous community? that regional peculiarities
G17 0580  6    do not still exist? that the Court order does not unequally
G17 0590  8    affect the Southern region? Who will deny that in a
G17 0600  7    vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible
G17 0610  4    with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent of the
G17 0620  3    governed"?
G17 0620  4       Circumstances alter cases. A friend of mine in New
G17 0630  5    Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular
G17 0640  1    trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a
G17 0640 12    marriage bell. He seemed a little surprised that it
G17 0650  7    should have caused any particular trouble anywhere.
G17 0660  3    I murmured something about a possible difference between
G17 0670  1    New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.
G17 0670  6       One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere: the
G17 0680  6    Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved viewpoint, It Doesn't
G17 0690  4    Affect Us! Southern Liberals (there are a good many)-
G17 0700  6    especially if they're rich- often exhibit blithe insouciance.
G17 0710  3    The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take
G17 0720  3    the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.
G17 0730  1    You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select
G17 0730 10    academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy
G17 0740 11    for boys, and you can be as liberal as you please with
G17 0750 10    strict impunity. If there's no suitable academy in
G17 0760  5    your own neighborhood, there's always New England.
G17 0770  2    New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces,
G17 0780  1    South as well as West. They may even enroll a colored
G17 0780 12    student or two for show, though he usually turns out
G17 0790 10    to be from Thailand, or any place other than the American
G17 0800  7    South. It would be interesting to know how much "integration"
G17 0810  5    there is in the famous, fashionable colleges and prep
G17 0820  3    schools of New England. A recent newspaper report said
G17 0830  2    there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class
G17 0830 11    of nearly one thousand at Yale; that is, about one-half
G17 0840  9    of one per cent, which looks pretty "tokenish" to me,
G17 0850  6    especially in an institution which professes to be
G17 0860  4    "national".
G17 0860  5       I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is
G17 0870  5    personally affected, who is willing to send his own
G17 0880  1    children to a mixed school as proof of his faith. I
G17 0880 12    leave out of account the question of the best interests
G17 0890  7    of the children, the question of what their best interests
G17 0900  6    really are. I'm talking about the grand manner of the
G17 0910  4    Liberal- North and South- who is not affected personally.
G17 0920  2    If these people were denied a voice (do they have a
G17 0930  1    moral right to a voice?), what voices would be left?
G17 0930 11    Who is involved willy nilly? Well, after everybody
G17 0940  6    has followed the New England pattern of segregating
G17 0950  4    one's children into private schools, only the poor
G17 0960  4    folks are left. And it is precisely in this poorer
G17 0960 14    economic class that one finds, and has always found,
G17 0970  9    the most racial friction.
G17 0980  1    ##
G17 0980  2    A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew
G17 0980 12    up in the South and has spent many years in New England,
G17 0990 12    said to me not long ago: "I can't forgive New England
G17 1000  9    for rejecting all complicity". Being a teacher of American
G17 1010  8    literature, I remembered Whittier's "Massachusetts
G17 1020  3    to Virginia", where he said: "But that one dark loathsome
G17 1030  6    burden ye must stagger with alone, And reap the bitter
G17 1040  5    harvest which ye yourselves have sown". There is a
G17 1050  3    legend (Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks".
G17 1050 11    and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the
G17 1060 11    effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought
G17 1070  6    a cargo of Negro slaves. Whether historically a fact
G17 1080  4    or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.
G17 1090  1       Complicity is an embarrassing word. It is something
G17 1100  1    which most of us try to get out from under. Like the
G17 1100 13    cowboy in Stephen Crane's "Blue Hotel", we run around
G17 1110  7    crying, "Well, I didn't do anything, did I"? Robert
G17 1120  7    Penn Warren puts it this way in "Brother to Dragons":
G17 1130  6    "The recognition of complicity is the beginning of
G17 1140  5    innocence", where innocence, I think, means about the
G17 1150  3    same thing as redemption. A man must be able to say,
G17 1150 14    "Father, I have sinned", or there is no hope for him.
G17 1160  8    Lincoln understood this better than most when he said
G17 1170  8    in his "Second Inaugural" that God "gives to both North
G17 1180  7    and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those
G17 1190  5    by whom the offense came". He also spoke of "the wealth
G17 1200  2    piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years
G17 1200 11    in unrequited toil". Lincoln was historian and economist
G17 1210  7    enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth
G17 1220  7    had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of
G17 1230  4    New Englanders engaged in the slave trade. After how
G17 1240  2    many generations is such wealth (mounting all the while
G17 1240 11    through the manipulations of high finance) purified
G17 1250  7    of taint? It is a question which New Englanders long
G17 1260  5    ago put out of their minds. But didn't they get off
G17 1270  4    too easy? The slaves never shared in their profits,
G17 1280  1    while they did share, in a very real sense, in the
G17 1280 12    profits of the slave-owners: they were fed, clothed,
G17 1290  7    doctored, and so forth; they were the beneficiaries
G17 1300  4    of responsible, paternalistic care.
G17 1310  1       Emerson- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire- sounded
G17 1310  5    a high Transcendental note in his "Boston Hymn", delivered
G17 1320  7    in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering
G17 1330  4    applause: "Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag
G17 1340  4    to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is owner,
G17 1350  1    And ever was. Pay him"! It is the abstractionism, the
G17 1350 11    unrealism, of the pure idealist. It ignores the sordid
G17 1360  9    financial aspects (quite conveniently, too, for his
G17 1370  5    audience, who could indulge in moral indignation without
G17 1380  2    visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money
G17 1390  1    from the transaction having been put away long ago
G17 1390 10    in a good antiseptic brokerage). Like Pilate, they
G17 1400  5    had washed their hands. But can one, really? Can God
G17 1410  4    be mocked, ever, in the long run?
G17 1410 11       New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject
G17 1420  9    of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of
G17 1430  7    the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, as
G17 1440  2    Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography": "
G17 1450  1       The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants
G17 1450  8    of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina
G17 1460  9    and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the
G17 1470  7    importation of slaves, and who on the contrary still
G17 1480  4    wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also I
G17 1490  2    believe felt a little tender under those censures;
G17 1490 10    for though their people had very few slaves themselves,
G17 1500  7    yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them
G17 1510  4    to others".
G17 1510  6       But that was a long time ago. The New England conscience
G17 1520  7    became desensitized. George W. Cable (naturalized New
G17 1530  5    Englander), writing in 1889 from "Paradise Road, Northampton"
G17 1540  3    (lovely symbolic name), agitated continuously the "Southern
G17 1550  3    question". It was nice to be able to isolate it.
G17 1560  2    ##
G17 1560  3    New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster
G17 1570  1    to the Nation. There one finds concentrated in a comparatively
G17 1580  1    small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory
G17 1580  9    schools of the United States. Why should this be so?
G17 1590 10    It is true that New England, more than any other section,
G17 1600  7    was dedicated to education from the start. But I think
G17 1610  7    that something more than this is involved.
G17 1620  1       How did it happen, for example, that the state university,
G17 1630  1    that great symbol of American democracy, failed to
G17 1630  9    flourish in New England as it did in other parts of
G17 1640  8    the country? Isn't it a bit odd that the three states
G17 1650  5    of Southern New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut,
G17 1660  1    and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university
G17 1670  1    status only in the very recent past, these institutions
G17 1670 10    having previously been A+M colleges? Was it supposed,
G17 1680  7    perchance, that A+M (vocational training, that is)
G17 1690  6    was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which
G17 1700  4    flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil
G17 1710  4    War period, the immigrants having been brought in from
G17 1720  1    Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for
G17 1720 12    the labor shortage caused by migration to the West?
G17 1730  8    Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state, Rhode
G17 1740  5    Island, should have been the very last of the forty-eight
G17 1750  6    to establish a state university? The state universities
G17 1760  2    of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and
G17 1760 11    more "respectable"; they had less immigration to contend
G17 1770  8    with.
G17 1780  1       A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in The
G17 1780 11    Yale Review, said: "We in New England have long since
G17 1790  9    segregated our children". He was referring not only
G17 1800  6    to the general college situation but more especially
G17 1810  4    to the preparatory schools. And what a galaxy of those
G17 1820  2    adorns that fair land! I don't propose to go into their
G17 1820 13    history, but I have one or two surmises. One is that
G17 1830 11    they were established, or gained eminence, under pressure
G17 1840  6    provided by these same immigrants, from whom the old
G17 1850  5    families wished to segregate their children. In the
G17 1860  3    early days of a homogeneous population, the public
G17 1860 11    school was quite satisfactory.
