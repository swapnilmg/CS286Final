K27 0010  1       "But tell me, doctor, where do you plan to conduct
K27 0010 11    the hatching"? Alex asked.
K27 0020  3       "That will have to be in the hotel", the doctor
K27 0030  3    retorted, confirming Alex's anticipations. "What I
K27 0040  1    want you to do is to go to the market with me early
K27 0040 14    tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into
K27 0050  8    the hotel".
K27 0050 10       The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the
K27 0060  8    hotel, room number nine, to initiate Alex further into
K27 0070  4    these undertakings.
K27 0070  6       The doctor opened the smallest of his cases, an
K27 0080  7    unimposing straw bag, and exposed the contents for
K27 0090  2    Alex's inspection. Inside, carefully packed in straw,
K27 0100  1    were six eggs, but the eye of a poultry psychologist
K27 0100 11    was required to detect what scientifically valuable
K27 0110  4    specimentalia lay inside; to Alex they were merely
K27 0120  4    six not unusual hens' eggs. There was little enough
K27 0130  1    time to contemplate them, however; in an instant the
K27 0130 10    doctor was stalking across the room with an antique
K27 0140  7    ledger in his hands, thoroughly eared and big as a
K27 0150  6    table top. He placed it on Alex's lap.
K27 0160  1       "This is my hen ledger", he informed him in an absorbed
K27 0160 11    way. "It's been going since 1908 when I was a junior
K27 0170 10    in college. That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe,
K27 0180  7    the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three
K27 0190  8    varieties- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries
K27 0200  5    at all. Couldn't take them near a river, though, or
K27 0210  3    they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving".
K27 0220  1       The ledger was full of most precise information:
K27 0230  1    date of laying, length of incubation period, number
K27 0230  9    of chicks reaching the first week, second week, fifth
K27 0240  7    week, weight of hen, size of rooster's wattles and
K27 0250  3    so on, all scrawled out in a hand that looked more
K27 0260  1    Chinese than English, the most jagged and sprawling
K27 0260  9    Alex had ever seen. Below these particulars was a series
K27 0270  7    of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses
K27 0280  5    which denoted the lineage of the breed. Alex's instruction
K27 0290  2    was rapid, for the doctor had to go off to the Rue
K27 0300  1    Ecole de Medecine to hear more speeches with only time
K27 0300 11    for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all.
K27 0310  9    But after the doctor's return that night Alex could
K27 0320  5    see, from the high window in his own room, the now
K27 0330  3    familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap
K27 0330 11    of towels, apparently giving its egg-hatching powers
K27 0340  7    one final chance before it was replaced in its office
K27 0350  6    by a sure-enough hen.
K27 0350 11       A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock
K27 0360  8    the following morning. It was the doctor, dressed and
K27 0370  6    ready for the expedition to the market, and Alex was
K27 0380  3    obliged to prepare himself in haste. The doctor stood
K27 0380 12    about, waiting for Alex to dress, with a show of impatience,
K27 0390 11    and soon they were moving, as quietly as could be,
K27 0400  8    through the still-dark hallways, past the bedroom of
K27 0410  5    the patronne, and so into the street. The market was
K27 0420  3    not far and, once there, the doctor's sense of immediacy
K27 0430  1    left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the
K27 0430 13    birds around him. He stroked the hens and they responded
K27 0440  8    with delighted clucks, he gobbled with the turkeys
K27 0450  4    and they at once were all attention, he quacked with
K27 0460  2    the ducks, and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered
K27 0460 12    geese. The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor
K27 0470 10    would never be done with his ministrations when quite
K27 0480  7    abruptly something broke his revery. It was a fine
K27 0490  5    broody hen, white, with a maternal eye and a striking
K27 0500  1    abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen.
K27 0500 11    The doctor, with the air of a man whose professional
K27 0510  9    interests have found scope, drew Alex's attention to
K27 0520  5    those excellences which might otherwise have escaped
K27 0530  3    him: the fine color in comb and wattles, the length
K27 0530 13    and quality of neck and saddle hackles, the firm, wide
K27 0540 10    spread of the toes, and a rare justness in the formation
K27 0550  9    of the ear lappets. All search was ended; he had found
K27 0560  6    his fowl. The purchase was effected and they made their
K27 0570  4    way towards the hotel again, the hen, with whom some
K27 0580  1    sort of communication had been set up, nestling in
K27 0580 10    the doctor's arms.
K27 0590  1       The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached
K27 0590  9    the hotel entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid
K27 0600  7    and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's
K27 0610  8    well exercised breast. The doctor was wearing a long
K27 0620  5    New England greatcoat, hardly necessary in the June
K27 0630  2    weather but a garment which proved well adapted to
K27 0630 11    the sequestration of hens. Alex entered first and was
K27 0640  8    followed by the doctor who, for all his care, manifested
K27 0650  6    a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen
K27 0660  3    was cradled. They advanced in a line across the entrance
K27 0670  1    hall to the stairway and up, with gingerly steps, towards
K27 0680 10    the first landing. It was then that they heard the
K27 0690  8    tread of one descending and, in some perturbation glancing
K27 0700  4    up, saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained
K27 0710  4    the landing.
K27 0710  6       "Bonjour, messieurs, vous etes matinals", she greeted
K27 0720  4    them pleasantly. Alex explained that they had been
K27 0730  2    out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor
K27 0730 11    edged around behind him, attempting to hide the protuberance
K27 0740  8    at his left side behind Alex's arm and back.
K27 0750  5       "Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite
K27 0760  4    alors"? their hostess enquired. Alex told her that
K27 0770  1    there was no hurry for their breakfasts, trying at
K27 0770 10    the same time to effect a speedy separation of the
K27 0780  7    persons before and behind him. The doctor, he noticed,
K27 0790  4    was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs,
K27 0800  1    but before the movement could be completed a distinct
K27 0800 10    and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of
K27 0810  9    the stair-well. Eyes swerved in the patronne's head,
K27 0820  5    Alex coughed loudly, and the doctor, with a sforzando
K27 0830  4    of chicken noises floating behind him, took to the
K27 0830 13    stairs in long-shanked leaps.
K27 0840  5       "Comment"? ejaculated the surprised woman, looking
K27 0850  3    at Alex for an explanation but he, parting from her
K27 0860  2    without ceremony, only offered a few words about the
K27 0860 11    doctor's provincial American speech and a state of
K27 0870  8    nerves brought on by the demands of his work. With
K27 0880  5    that he hurried up the stairs, followed by her suspicious
K27 0900  1    gaze.
K27 0900  2       When Alex entered his room, the doctor was already
K27 0910  1    preparing a nest in the straw case, six eggs ready
K27 0910 11    for the hen's attentions. There was no reference to
K27 0920  7    the incident on the stairs, his powers being absorbed
K27 0930  4    by this more immediate business. The hen appeared to
K27 0940  2    have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle
K27 0940 14    down to the performance of them. One part of her audience
K27 0950 11    was totally engaged, the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly
K27 0960  6    fine performance of some ancient classic, the other
K27 0970  5    part, the guest of the connoisseur, attentive as one
K27 0980  3    who must take an intelligent interest in that which
K27 0980 12    he does not fully understand. The spectacle progressed
K27 0990  7    towards a denouement which was obviously still remote;
K27 1000  5    the audience attended. Time elapsed but the doctor
K27 1010  4    was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome
K27 1020  1    knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature.
K27 1020 10    Startled, he jumped up to pull hen and case out of
K27 1030 11    view, and Alex went to the door. He opened it a crack
K27 1040  7    and in doing so made as much shuffling, coughing, and
K27 1050  3    scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations
K27 1060  1    from the hen who had begun to protest. It was Giselle,
K27 1060 12    the fille de chambre, come to clean the room, and while
K27 1070  9    she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard
K27 1080  6    all curiosity, explaining her errand, Alex could see
K27 1090  3    from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he
K27 1090 14    could to calm the displeased bird. Giselle was reluctant
K27 1100  9    but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in
K27 1110  8    five minutes and the door was shut again.
K27 1120  2       "Who was that, young feller"? the doctor instantly
K27 1130  1    asked.
K27 1130  2       "That was the fille de chambre, the one you thought
K27 1140  1    couldn't get the eggs out. She looked mighty interested,
K27 1140 10    though. Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to
K27 1150  9    do the room".
K27 1160  1       The doctor's mind was working at a great speed;
K27 1160 10    he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex
K27 1170  7    in a muted voice.
K27 1170 11       "Have you got our keys handy"?
K27 1180  6       "Right in my pocket".
K27 1190  1       "All right. Now you go outside and beckon me when
K27 1190 11    it's safe". The hall was empty and Alex beckoned; they
K27 1200  9    climbed the stairs which creaked, very loudly to their
K27 1210  7    sensitive ears, and reached the next floor. A guest
K27 1220  4    was locking his room; they passed behind him and got
K27 1230  2    to Alex's room unnoticed. The doctor sat down rather
K27 1230 11    wearily, caressing the hen and remarking that the city
K27 1240  9    was not the place for a poultry-loving man, but no
K27 1250  6    sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door
K27 1260  2    obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once
K27 1260 12    more. At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly
K27 1270  9    astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes.
K27 1280  8    It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected,
K27 1290  6    and that it had to take place between the time the
K27 1300  3    fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began
K27 1310  1    Alex's. They waited three minutes and then crept out
K27 1310 10    on tip-toe; the halls were empty and they passed down
K27 1320  9    the stairs to number nine and listened at the door.
K27 1330  6    A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being
K27 1340  2    arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence
K27 1340  9    inside; they listened and suddenly a step towards the
K27 1350  9    door announced another important fact. The doctor shot
K27 1360  7    down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob, but to
K27 1370  5    no effect: the lavatory was occupied. Although a look
K27 1380  3    of alarm passed over his face, he did not arrest his
K27 1380 14    movements but disappeared into the shower room just
K27 1390  8    as the chambermaid emerged from number nine. Alex suppressed
K27 1400  6    those expressions of relief which offered to prevail
K27 1410  4    in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted
K27 1420  1    they were in any case for, as he stood facing the fille
K27 1420 13    de chambre, his ears were assailed by new sounds from
K27 1430  9    the interior of the shower room. The events of the
K27 1440  6    last quarter of an hour, mysterious to any bird accustomed
K27 1450  4    only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard,
K27 1460  1    had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series
K27 1460 12    of cackly wails, perhaps mourning her nest, but briefly
K27 1470  7    enjoyed. The doctor's wits had not left him, however,
K27 1480  7    for all his sixty-eight years, and the wails were almost
K27 1490  4    immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out
K27 1500  1    from the showerhead. Alex nodded to the maid as though
K27 1500 11    nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's
K27 1510  8    room. Shortly, the doctor himself entered, his hair
K27 1520  5    somewhat wet from the shower, but evidently satisfied
K27 1530  2    with the outcome of their adventures. Without comment
K27 1530 10    he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed
K27 1540  9    a highboard around the egg case which he had placed
K27 1550  8    on the floor inside. Next, the hen was nested and all
K27 1560  5    seemed well. The two men sat for some time, savoring
K27 1570  1    the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such
K27 1570 11    escape brings, before they got up and left the hotel,
K27 1580  9    the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to
K27 1590  5    go to the main post office.
K27 1590 11       Alex returned to the hotel, rather weary and with
K27 1600  8    no new prospects of a role, in the late afternoon,
K27 1610  5    but found the doctor in an ebullient mood. At the time
K27 1620  3    Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate
K27 1620 13    communication with the hen, who had settled herself
K27 1630  8    on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of
K27 1640  5    the morning.
K27 1640  7       "Chickens have short memories", the doctor remarked,
K27 1650  5    "that's why they are better company than most people
K27 1660  4    I know", and he went on to break some important news
K27 1670  2    to Alex. "Well", he began, "It seems like some people
K27 1680  1    in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers
K27 1680 12    over at the conference house do. They've got a big
K27 1690  7    vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here, with a wife
K27 1700  6    for him, too, very rare birds, both of them, the only
K27 1710  2    Vulturidae of their species outside Africa. Seems like
K27 1720  1    she's willing, but the male just flops around all day
K27 1730 10    like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the
K27 1740  7    barn and then didn't know what to do, and the people
K27 1750  5    at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for
K27 1760  2    their trouble.
