F24 0010  1       THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in
F24 0010 11    the evening, roused around me the varied voices and
F24 0020  8    faces of fear.
F24 0030  1       "Sounds exactly like last time". The young man spoke
F24 0030  9    steadily enough, but all at once he looked grotesquely
F24 0040  8    unshaven. The middle-aged man said over and over, "Why
F24 0050  6    did I come here, why did I come here". Then he was
F24 0060  4    sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic
F24 0060 13    weapons, I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the
F24 0070  9    lights went out.
F24 0075  1       This was my second day in Vientiane, the administrative
F24 0080  7    capital of Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave.
F24 0090  9    Where was my flashlight? Where should I go? To my room?
F24 0100  8    Better stay in the hotel lobby, where the walls looked
F24 0110  5    good and thick.
F24 0110  8       Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were
F24 0120  6    slamming their steel shutters. Hotel attendants pulled
F24 0130  3    parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small
F24 0140  1    boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please".
F24 0150  1    She held out her hand to show that she had money.
F24 0150 12       The American newspaperman worried about getting
F24 0160  5    to the cable office. But what was the story? Had the
F24 0170  6    Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far? Or
F24 0180  3    was it another revolt inside Vientiane?
F24 0180  9       "Let's play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof
F24 0190 10    and see".
F24 0200  1    #GUNFIRE SAVES THE MOON#
F24 0200  4    By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had been an eclipse
F24 0210  4    of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that
F24 0220  1    the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy
F24 0220 12    was to make all possible noise, ideally with firearms.
F24 0230  6       The din was successful, too, for just before the
F24 0240  6    moon disappeared, the frightened toad had begun to
F24 0250  2    spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.
F24 0250 12       How quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant
F24 0270 10    posted a reminder to patrons "who became excited and
F24 0280  6    left without paying their checks". But everyone I met
F24 0290  5    had sought cover first and asked questions later. And
F24 0300  2    no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood,
F24 0300 11    had become the City of Bullet Holes.
F24 0310  7       I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars
F24 0320  5    in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly
F24 0330  1    a house had not been peppered. In place of the police
F24 0330 12    headquarters was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars
F24 0340  9    had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to
F24 0350  7    the American Embassy next door. What had been the ambassador's
F24 0360  5    suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick.
F24 0370  2       This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane,
F24 0380  1    fought less than three months earlier when four successive
F24 0380 10    governments had ruled here in three days (December
F24 0390  8    9-11, 1960). And now, in March, all Laos suffered a
F24 0400  5    state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held two northern
F24 0410  3    provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.
F24 0420  1    Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread
F24 0420 10    fear of ambush and death.
F24 0430  3       "And it's all the more tragic because it's so little
F24 0440  3    deserved", said Mr. J. J. A. Frans, a Belgian official
F24 0450  2    of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
F24 0450  9    Cultural Organization. We talked after I hailed his
F24 0460  8    Jeep marked with the U. N. flag.
F24 0470  5       Practically all the people of Laos, he explained-
F24 0480  1    about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the
F24 0480 11    means and motives of modern war are as strange to them
F24 0490 11    as clocks and steel plows. They look after their fields
F24 0500  7    and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand
F24 0510  6    villages, with an average of 200 souls. Nobody can
F24 0520  3    tell more closely how many villages there are. They
F24 0520 12    spread over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they
F24 0530 10    include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians
F24 0540  6    are from Patagonians.
F24 0540  9    #LIFE MUST BE KEPT IN HARMONY#
F24 0550  6    "What matters here is family loyalty; faith in the
F24 0560  4    Buddha and staying at peace with the phis, the spirits;
F24 0570  1    and to live in harmony with nature".
F24 0570  8       Harmony in Laos? "Precisely", said Mr. Frans. He
F24 0580  6    spoke of the season of dryness and dust, brought by
F24 0590  6    the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony with the
F24 0600  3    season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from
F24 0600 13    the southwest. The slim pirogues in harmony with the
F24 0610  8    majestically meandering Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted
F24 0620  6    girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by
F24 0630  4    the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For so
F24 0640  2    long as death was not violent, it was natural and to
F24 0640 13    be welcomed, making a funeral a feast.
F24 0650  6       To many a Frenchman- they came 95 years ago, colonized,
F24 0660  5    and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953- the
F24 0670  2    land had been even more delightfully tranquil than
F24 0670 10    Tahiti. Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive
F24 0680 10    headaches of statesmen around the globe. The Pathet
F24 0690  6    Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring
F24 0700  3    North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft. The
F24 0710  2    Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped
F24 0710 13    with American funds. In six years, U. S. aid had amounted
F24 0720 11    to more than $1.60 for each American- a total of three
F24 0730 10    hundred million dollars.
F24 0740  1       We were there at a moment when the situation in
F24 0740 11    Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's
F24 0750  8    giants. Even if it did not, how would this little world
F24 0760  8    of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades
F24 0770  5    and submachine guns?
F24 0770  8       To find out, we traveled throughout that part of
F24 0780  6    Laos still nominally controlled, in the daytime at
F24 0790  4    least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the City
F24 0800  1    of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the
F24 0800 11    City of Lions in the northwest, close to Communist
F24 0810  8    China (map, page 250). We rode over roads so rough
F24 0820  7    that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts,
F24 0830  3    all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety
F24 0840  1    planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't
F24 0840 10    crash. In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire.
F24 0850  8       "We" were Bill Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
F24 0860  6    Illustrations Staff, whose three cameras and eight
F24 0870  5    lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting
F24 0880  2    man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.
F24 0890  1       Boun My- the name means one who has a boun, a celebration,
F24 0890 13    and is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the
F24 0900  9    Border of Paradise. He had attended three universities
F24 0910  6    in the United States. But he had never seen the mountainous
F24 0920  7    half of his native land north of Vientiane, including
F24 0930  2    the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes
F24 0940  1    came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible.
F24 0940 11    #PRIME MINISTER MOVES FAST#
F24 0950  4    Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To go outside
F24 0960  3    the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed
F24 0970  1    a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or
F24 0970 11    captured, and few soldiers could be spared as escorts.
F24 0980  8       We were told that to the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped
F24 0990  6    American was worth at least $750, a fortune in Laos.
F24 1000  3    Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had
F24 1010  1    spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were
F24 1010  9    reported marching him barefoot from village to village,
F24 1020  7    as evidence of evil American intervention.
F24 1030  2       Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government
F24 1040  1    offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and
F24 1040  9    pleasing conversation in French, we were getting nowhere.
F24 1050  7    We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy
F24 1060  8    must be true, when we were invited to take a trip with
F24 1070  6    the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15 minutes?
F24 1080  2    His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out
F24 1080 13    of town, and he was eager to be off.
F24 1090  9    #PRINCE WEARS TEN-GALLON HAT#
F24 1090 14    And so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we
F24 1100  9    found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind
F24 1110  7    the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, a
F24 1120  5    tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and
F24 1130  2    a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag
F24 1130 12    peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger.
F24 1140  7       The temperature rose to 105`. With our company of
F24 1150  5    soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.
F24 1160  1       In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister
F24 1170  1    bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks
F24 1170 10    for me. Then we drove on, until there was no more road
F24 1180 11    and we traversed dry rice fields, bouncing across their
F24 1190  5    squat earth walls.
F24 1190  8       It was a spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing,
F24 1200  8    a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or
F24 1210  6    dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a new house
F24 1220  3    for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to
F24 1220 13    keep up. We were miserable.
F24 1230  4       But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone from Luang
F24 1240  3    Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania- were
F24 1250  4    beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they
F24 1250 12    had probably done more than any other men to help push
F24 1260 10    Laos toward the 20th century- constructively. Mr. Keo,
F24 1270  4    once a diplomat in Paris and Washington, was Commissioner
F24 1280  3    of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist
F24 1290  1    with a doctorate from the London School of Economics,
F24 1300  1    headed the rural development division of USOM, the
F24 1300  9    United States Operations Mission administering U.S.
F24 1310  5    aid.
F24 1310  6       "What you see are self-help projects", John said.
F24 1320  9    "We ask the people what they want, and they supply
F24 1330  7    the labor. We send shovels, cement, nails, and corrugated
F24 1340  3    iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary for
F24 1350  2    $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up
F24 1350 12    to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools.
F24 1360  8    Ask Mr. Keo".
F24 1370  1       Mr. Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting
F24 1380 10    things as they found them", he said. "Where there was
F24 1390  9    no road, they lived without one. Now they learn that
F24 1400  7    men can change their surroundings, through their traditional
F24 1410  4    village elders, without violence. That's a big step
F24 1420  4    toward a modern state. You might say we are in the
F24 1420 15    nation-building business".
F24 1430  2       In the villages people lined up to give us flowers.
F24 1440  3    Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime
F24 1440 12    Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode
F24 1450  9    rapidly among the houses, joked with the local soldiery,
F24 1460  7    and made a speech. The soldiers are fighting and the
F24 1470  5    Americans are helping, he said, but in the fight against
F24 1480  3    the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
F24 1490  1       Then we were off again. We did it for three days.
F24 1490 12       But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery.
F24 1500 10    Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak,
F24 1510  7    on a raft with an outboard motor, we took off our dusty
F24 1520  7    shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze. Then we
F24 1530  4    hung overboard in the water.
F24 1530  9       Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song,
F24 1540  9    on the cool Bolovens Plateau. The Prince visited the
F24 1550  5    hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported by the
F24 1560  3    Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and
F24 1560 11    fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence
F24 1570 10    at Pak Song.
F24 1570 13    #STRINGS KEEP SOULS IN PLACE#
F24 1580  5    In the village of Soukhouma, which means "Peaceful",
F24 1590  2    we had a baci. This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies.
F24 1600  2    It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing
F24 1610  1    for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding,
F24 1610  9    a newborn child, the sick, the New Year, for any good
F24 1620  9    purpose.
F24 1620 10       The preparations were elaborate: flowers, candles,
F24 1630  5    incense sticks, rice wine, dozens of delicacies, and
F24 1640  4    pieces of white cotton string. The strings were draped
F24 1650  2    around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).
F24 1650 10       The candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo
F24 1660 10    mats among the village notables. I was careful to keep
F24 1670  7    my feet, the seat of the least worthy spirits, from
F24 1680  3    pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits
F24 1690  1    reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine
F24 1690 10    divinities to come and join us.
F24 1700  5       Next he addressed himself to our souls. A man has
F24 1710  3    32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls
F24 1710 14    like to wander off, and must be called back.
F24 1720  8       With the divinities present and our souls in place,
F24 1730  6    we were wished health, happiness, and power. Then,
F24 1740  2    one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton
F24 1740 11    strings around our wrists. These were to be kept on,
F24 1750 10    to hold in the 32 souls.
F24 1760  1       As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came
F24 1760 11    up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand. It
F24 1770  9    had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar. We
F24 1780  7    could see maggots moving.
F24 1780 11       John said: "I have some antiseptic salve with me,
F24 1790  8    but it's too late for that".
