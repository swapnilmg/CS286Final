L05 0010  1       Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke, and
L05 0010 10    went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry
L05 0020  8    socks and shoes. Rourke was talking on the phone when
L05 0030  6    he came back. "About an hour, eh? Are you positive"?
L05 0040  3    He listened a moment and then said, "Hold it". He turned
L05 0050  3    his head and said, "Alvarez will definitely be in a
L05 0050 13    back room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within
L05 0060 11    an hour. Want to try and meet him there"?
L05 0070  7       Shayne looked at his watch. That wasn't too far
L05 0080  4    from Fifth Street, and should allow him to make Scotty's
L05 0090  2    Bar by midnight. He said with satisfaction, "That's
L05 0100  1    fine, Tim. I'll be there".
L05 0100  6       Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone
L05 0110  4    and hung up. "I don't know what you're getting into,
L05 0120  2    Mike", he said unhappily. "I hope to Christ ...".
L05 0130  1       Shayne said briskly, "Grab another drink if you
L05 0130  9    want it. We've got one other call to make before I
L05 0140  9    meet Alvarez".
L05 0150  1       "Where"?
L05 0150  2       "It's out in the Northeast section. Have you got
L05 0160  3    my car here"?
L05 0160  6       "It's parked in front". Rourke hastily slopped whiskey
L05 0170  4    into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes.
L05 0180  1       "I'd better keep on driving yours", Shayne decided,
L05 0190  1    "because I'll be going on over to the Beach. I can
L05 0190 12    drop you back here to pick mine up". He went to a closet
L05 0200 11    to get a light jacket, and took his hat from beside
L05 0210  7    the door. Timothy Rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily
L05 0220  4    and joined him, asking, "Who are we going to call on
L05 0230  2    in the Northeast section"?
L05 0230  6       "A lady. That is, maybe not too much of a lady.
L05 0240  7    At least, I want to find out whether she's home yet
L05 0250  3    or not". He opened the door and followed Rourke out.
L05 0260  1       In Rourke's car, Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard
L05 0270  1    and north toward Felice Perrin's address which had
L05 0270  9    been given to him by the Peralta governess. As he drove,
L05 0280  9    he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of
L05 0290  6    the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the
L05 0300  5    Peralta house, and on his own surmises.
L05 0300 12       "I want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha
L05 0310 10    makes her phone call there", he ended grimly. "I don't
L05 0320  7    know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything
L05 0330  6    to do with this situation or not, but I want to see
L05 0340  5    who takes the call".
L05 0340  9       "This deal at Las Putas Buenas where the two knife-men
L05 0350  8    jumped you", said Rourke with interest, "that sounds
L05 0360  4    like it was set up with malice aforethought by the
L05 0370  3    luscious Mrs. Peralta, doesn't it"?
L05 0370  8       "It does", Shayne grunted sourly, still able to
L05 0380  8    taste her mouth on his in the Green Jungle parking
L05 0400  5    lot. "That story of hers about an unsigned note directing
L05 0410  3    her to be there tonight sounds completely phony. If
L05 0420  1    it was designed to put me on the spot, it would have
L05 0420 13    to have been written before Peralta ever called me
L05 0430  6    in on the case".
L05 0430 10       "Do you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet
L05 0440  9    made without her husband's knowledge"?
L05 0450  2       "I haven't the faintest idea. I think her husband
L05 0460  4    strongly suspects so, and that's why he called me in
L05 0470  2    on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates
L05 0470 11    ... and almost certainly without telling them why he
L05 0480  7    was doing so. Isn't this Felice's street"? Shayne asked,
L05 0490  4    peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign.
L05 0500  4       Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side,
L05 0510  2    and he said, "Yes. Turn to the left, I think, for that
L05 0520  1    number you gave me. Not more than a block or so".
L05 0520 12       Shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across
L05 0530 10    the Boulevard divider. There was a small, neon-lighted
L05 0540  6    restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner
L05 0550  2    of the intersection as he turned into the quiet, palm-lined
L05 0560  1    street where most of the houses on both sides were
L05 0560 11    older two-story mansions, now cut up into furnished
L05 0570  7    rooms and housekeeping apartments.
L05 0580  1       Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly,
L05 0580  8    letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch
L05 0590  9    for street numbers. A single automobile was parked
L05 0600  4    half-way up the block on the left-hand side. Shayne
L05 0610  2    noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates
L05 0610 11    as he approached, and then saw the flare of a match
L05 0620 10    in the front seat as they passed, indicating that it
L05 0630  5    was occupied.
L05 0630  7       He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two
L05 0640  7    men in the parked car just as Rourke said, "It's the
L05 0650  4    next house, Mike. On the right".
L05 0650 10       Instead of pulling into the curb, Shayne increased
L05 0660  8    his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left.
L05 0670  7    He went around the corner and parked, turning off his
L05 0680  4    lights and motor.
L05 0680  7       "I told you, Mike", said Rourke in an aggrieved
L05 0690  5    voice. "It was back there ...".
L05 0700  1       Shayne said, "I know it was, Tim". His voice was
L05 0700 11    chilling and cold. "Did you see the car parked across
L05 0710  9    the street"?
L05 0720  1       "I didn't notice it. I was watching for numbers
L05 0720 10    ...".
L05 0730  1       "It has a Beach license, Tim. Two men in the front
L05 0730 11    seat. I got a quick look at their faces as we went
L05 0740  9    past. Unless I'm crazy as hell, they're two of Painter's
L05 0750  5    dicks. A couple named Harris and Geely. Those names
L05 0760  3    mean anything to you"?
L05 0760  7       "Wait a minute, Mike. In Painter's office this evening
L05 0770  7    ...".
L05 0770  8       Shayne nodded grimly. "The pair whom Petey is officially
L05 0780  9    commending for slapping me around and pulling me in".
L05 0790  8       "What are they doing here"?
L05 0800  2       "A stake-out, I suppose. On Felice Perrin. Maybe
L05 0810  2    with specific orders to see that I don't make contact
L05 0810 12    with her. I'm not positive, Tim. I may be wrong. I'll
L05 0820 10    slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail
L05 0830  9    lounge on Biscayne. You drive on and circle back and
L05 0840  6    pull up beside them parked there. You're a reporter,
L05 0850  3    and you're looking for Miss Perrin to interview her.
L05 0860  1    Make them show their hands. If they are Beach cops
L05 0860 11    on a stake-out, they'll admit it to a reporter. They've
L05 0870  8    got no official standing on this side of the Bay. As
L05 0880  8    soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris,
L05 0890  3    come on around to the lounge where I'll be waiting".
L05 0900  1       Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out.
L05 0900 11    Timothy Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the
L05 0910  9    wheel. "The things you talk me into, Mike ...".
L05 0920  6       Shayne chuckled. "How often do they add up to headlines?
L05 0930  7    You should complain".
L05 0930 10       He crossed the street and walked swiftly southward
L05 0940  7    to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to
L05 0950  6    the open restaurant.
L05 0950  9       He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a
L05 0960  9    slug of cognac when Rourke came in six or eight minutes
L05 0970  6    later. The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him
L05 0980  2    at the bar. Shayne told the bartender, "Bourbon and
L05 0980 11    water", and Rourke told him, "It's those two, all right.
L05 0990 10    Harris and Geely. I made them show me their identification
L05 1000  9    before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin".
L05 1010  8       Shayne said happily, "I've got it all worked out,
L05 1020  7    Tim. Take your time with your drink. I'll beat it.
L05 1030  5    In exactly three minutes, go in that phone booth behind
L05 1040  3    you and call Police Headquarters. Be excited and don't
L05 1050  1    identify yourself. Just say that a couple of drunks
L05 1050 10    are having a hell of a fight down the street, and they
L05 1060  9    better send a patrol car. Then hang up fast and come
L05 1070  6    walking on down to the Perrin address. I'll be waiting
L05 1080  3    for you there".
L05 1080  6       The bartender brought Rourke's drink and Shayne
L05 1090  4    laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar. He said in a
L05 1100  2    low voice, "I've got a date with a lady, Mister. Will
L05 1100 13    that pay for a pint I can take with me. You know how
L05 1110 13    it is", he added with a conspiratorial wink. "Candy
L05 1120  5    is dandy, but liquor is quicker ... and you don't have
L05 1130  5    any candy for sale here anyhow".
L05 1130 11       "We sure don't". The bartender winked back at him
L05 1140  9    and palmed the bill. He turned away and returned in
L05 1150  7    a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack
L05 1160  5    which he slid over the counter to Shayne.
L05 1170  1       As the detective slid it into his pocket, Rourke
L05 1170 10    asked sadly, "What in hell are you going to do, Mike"?
L05 1180  9       "Make a couple of punk detectives named Geely and
L05 1190  6    Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this
L05 1200  6    afternoon. Three minutes, Tim".
L05 1200 10       Shayne strode out blithely, and Rourke checked his
L05 1210  8    watch and sipped his drink, getting a dime ready to
L05 1220  6    make the telephone call to the police.
L05 1230  1       Outside, Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke
L05 1230  9    had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed
L05 1240  9    south. He walked over to the right-hand door, opened
L05 1250  6    it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove
L05 1260  3    compartment and put it in his hip pocket. He hoped
L05 1260 13    he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the
L05 1270 11    Beach detectives, but its weight was comforting at
L05 1280  6    his hip. On this side of the Bay, Miami Beach cops
L05 1290  3    had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen,
L05 1290 12    and Shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs.
L05 1300 10       He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked
L05 1310  8    car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat.
L05 1320  5    He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached,
L05 1330  1    stepped out into the street just behind the car and
L05 1330 11    strode around to the right-hand side.
L05 1340  6       The big, paunchy man named Geely was on that side,
L05 1350  5    half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion
L05 1360  2    so that his back partially rested against the closed
L05 1360 11    door.
L05 1370  1       Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open
L05 1370 10    before either of the men were quite aware of his presence
L05 1380 10    in the night.
L05 1380 13       Geely grunted and slid partly out, and Shayne's
L05 1390  8    left arm snaked in around his neck to help him, while
L05 1400  7    he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his
L05 1410  4    right fist to the big, gum-chewing jaw before Geely
L05 1410 14    could straighten up.
L05 1420  3       Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground,
L05 1430  2    and then dived over him through the open door into
L05 1430 12    Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a
L05 1440  9    gun from a shoulder holster, somewhat impeded by the
L05 1450  5    steering wheel.
L05 1450  7       Shayne locked his big hands around Harris' thin
L05 1460  5    neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway.
L05 1470  3    He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and
L05 1470 15    felt the body go limp. He dropped him into the street
L05 1480 11    a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure
L05 1490  6    and stared down at both of them for a moment before
L05 1500  5    kicking the big man lightly in the side. He didn't
L05 1510  1    stir. They were both breathing heavily, out cold, and
L05 1510 10    Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him
L05 1520  8    or could describe him.
L05 1530  1       He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and
L05 1530 12    unscrewed the top, sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally
L05 1540  7    over both men, and then tossed the open bottle in on
L05 1550  6    the front seat.
L05 1550  9       He turned, then, to look toward the lighted Boulevard,
L05 1560  6    and saw Rourke's tall, emaciated figure come out of
L05 1570  5    the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the
L05 1580  1    street toward the opposite side.
L05 1580  6       Shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter
L05 1590  3    in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin
L05 1600  1    lived, and asked casually, "Get the police okay"?
L05 1610  1       "Sure. Said they'd have a patrol car here fast.
L05 1610 10    Let's get inside. What happened with you"?
L05 1620  5       "Why the two damned fools got all excited when they
L05 1630  6    saw the bottle, and knocked each other out cold", Shayne
L05 1640  3    said good-humoredly. "They'll have fun explaining that
L05 1650  2    to the Miami cops. Got no business over here on a stake-out
L05 1650 15    anyway".
L05 1660  1       They went up onto a front porch and into a small
L05 1660 12    hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling.
L05 1670 10    A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names
L05 1680  8    on them. Shayne found one marked PERRIN 2-A.
L05 1690  4       The stairway on the right was dark, but there was
L05 1700  3    a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim
L05 1700 13    bulb at the top, and they went up.
L05 1710  8       There were two front rooms, both dark behind their
L05 1720  4    transoms, and there was no sound or light in the entire
L05 1730  1    house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.
