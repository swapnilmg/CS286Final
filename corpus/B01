B01 0010  1    #ASSEMBLY SESSION BROUGHT MUCH GOOD#
B01 0010  6    The General Assembly, which adjourns today, has performed
B01 0020  5    in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day
B01 0030  4    it convened. It was faced immediately with a showdown
B01 0040  1    on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in
B01 0040 11    conjunction with the governor with a decision not to
B01 0050  7    risk abandoning public education.
B01 0060  1       There followed the historic appropriations and budget
B01 0060  8    fight, in which the General Assembly decided to tackle
B01 0070  8    executive powers. The final decision went to the executive
B01 0080  7    but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting
B01 0090  2    procedures and to provide legislators information they
B01 0100  2    need.
B01 0100  3       Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance
B01 0110  1    them have become musts if the state in the next few
B01 0110 12    years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government. This
B01 0120  6    session, for instance, may have insured a financial
B01 0140  3    crisis two years from now.
B01 0140  8       In all the turmoil, some good legislation was passed.
B01 0150  6    Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and
B01 0160  5    await future action. Certainly all can applaud passage
B01 0170  1    of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase
B01 0170 11    in teacher pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance
B01 0180  8    by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state
B01 0190  5    roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside
B01 0200  3    city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and
B01 0200 13    the road maintenance bond issue.
B01 0210  5       No action has been taken, however, on such major
B01 0220  4    problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification
B01 0230  1    of the county unit system and in outright banning of
B01 0230 11    fireworks sales. Only a token start was made in attacking
B01 0240 10    the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue
B01 0250  6    of attracting industry to the state.
B01 0260  1       The legislature expended most of its time on the
B01 0260 10    schools and appropriations questions. Fortunately it
B01 0270  4    spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions
B01 0280  4    which in the past have made Georgia look like anything
B01 0290  2    but "the empire state of the South".
B01 0290  9       We congratulate the entire membership on its record
B01 0300  7    of good legislation. In the interim between now and
B01 0310  5    next year, we trust the House and Senate will put their
B01 0320  3    minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal
B01 0330  1    and social problems and come up with answers without
B01 0330 10    all the political heroics. @
B01 0340  3    #LEAGUE REGULARLY STANDS ON THE SIDE OF RIGHT#
B01 0340 11    The League of Women Voters, 40 now and admitting it
B01 0350 10    proudly, is inviting financial contributions in the
B01 0360  5    windup of its fund drive. It's a good use of money.
B01 0370  5       These women whose organization grew out of the old
B01 0380  3    suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's
B01 0380 10    dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but
B01 0390  9    "Keep alive their attention".
B01 0400  2       "If once they become inattentive to the public affairs",
B01 0410  2    Jefferson said, "you and I, and Congress and assemblies,
B01 0420  1    judges and governors, shall all become wolves".
B01 0420  8       Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware
B01 0430  6    of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the
B01 0440  5    league gives to public affairs. The league workers
B01 0450  2    search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues
B01 0450 13    and make them available to the public. The harder the
B01 0460 10    choice, the more willing the league is to wade in.
B01 0470  7    And the league takes a stand, with great regularity,
B01 0480  2    on the side of right. @
B01 0480  8    #LOOK TO COOSA VALLEY FOR INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS#
B01 0490  3    Cities and counties interested in industrial development
B01 0500  2    would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes
B01 0500 13    peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that
B01 0510  4    are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development
B01 0520  6    Commission.
B01 0520  7       Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000
B01 0530  9    state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver, the group
B01 0540  5    expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech.
B01 0550  3    Then a full-time planning office will be established
B01 0560  1    in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research
B01 0560 12    staff for development of an area planning and industrial
B01 0570  9    development program.
B01 0580  1       The undertaking has abundant promise. It recognizes
B01 0580  8    the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors
B01 0590  9    and that by banding together in an area-wide effort
B01 0600  7    better results can be accomplished than through the
B01 0610  3    go-it-alone approach. @
B01 0610  8    #RUSK IDEA STRENGTHENS UNITED STATES DEFENSE#
B01 0620  3    The Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing the
B01 0640  1    Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave
B01 0640  9    danger that has existed.
B01 0650  3       The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs
B01 0660  1    would deter Russia's use of hers; that theory was and
B01 0660 11    is sound. The danger lay in the American delusion that
B01 0670 10    nuclear deterrence was enough.
B01 0680  3       By limiting American strength too much to nuclear
B01 0690  1    strength, this country limited its ability to fight
B01 0690  9    any kind of war besides a nuclear war. This strategy
B01 0700  7    heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear
B01 0710  6    war.
B01 0710  7       It also weakened our diplomatic stance, because
B01 0720  3    Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear
B01 0730  1    war except in the ultimate extremity.
B01 0730  7       This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start
B01 0740  6    low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity.
B01 0750  2       By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing
B01 0760  1    American military forces to fight conventional wars
B01 0760  8    too, Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear
B01 0770  8    brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety
B01 0780  5    into our military position. @
B01 0790  1    #DEKALB BUDGET SHOWS COUNTY IS ON BEAM#
B01 0800  6    DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries
B01 0810  4    with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.
B01 0820  1       It includes a raise in the county minimum wage,
B01 0820 10    creation of several new jobs at the executive level,
B01 0830  9    financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts,
B01 0840  4    and increased expenditures for essential services such
B01 0850  3    as health and welfare, fire protection, sanitation
B01 0850 10    and road maintenance.
B01 0860  3       That such expansion can be obtained without a raise
B01 0870  3    in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound
B01 0870 15    fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners,
B01 0880 10    headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating
B01 0890  7    that the public trust he was given was well placed,
B01 0900  7    and other county officials. @
B01 0900 12    #SOMEWHERE, SOMEBODY IS BOUND TO LOVE US#
B01 0910  7    G. Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of
B01 0920  4    diplomacy rapidly. Touring Africa, the new U.S. assistant
B01 0930  3    secretary of state observed "Africa should be for the
B01 0940  3    Africans" and the British promptly denounced him. Then
B01 0940 11    he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying
B01 0950  8    signs saying "American imperialists, go home". Chin
B01 0960  5    up, Soapy. @
B01 0960  8    #POWER COMPANY BACKS CONFIDENCE WITH DOLLARS#
B01 0970  5    Confidence in the state's economic future is reflected
B01 0980  4    in the Georgia Power Company's record construction
B01 0990  1    budget for this year.
B01 0990  5       The firm does a large amount of research and its
B01 1000  4    forecasts have meaning. It is good to know that Georgia
B01 1010  1    will continue to have sufficient electrical power not
B01 1010  9    only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage
B01 1020  9    a more rapid rate of industrialization.
B01 1040  1       Georgia's mental health program received a badly
B01 1040  8    needed boost from the General Assembly in the form
B01 1050  8    of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville
B01 1060  4    State Hospital.
B01 1060  6       Actually it amounts to $1,250,000 above what the
B01 1070  6    institution already is receiving, considering the additional
B01 1080  3    half-million dollars Gov. Vandiver allocated last year
B01 1090  3    from the state surplus.
B01 1090  7       Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money
B01 1100  6    and is. But exactly how far it will go toward improving
B01 1110  2    conditions is another question because there is so
B01 1110 10    much that needs doing.
B01 1120  3       The practice of charging employes for meals whether
B01 1130  1    they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.
B01 1130 11    The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours
B01 1140  9    and more per week should be reduced.
B01 1150  2       More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.
B01 1160  1    Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.
B01 1160  9       Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal
B01 1170  9    year, Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per
B01 1180  5    day per patient. The national average is more than
B01 1190  3    $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the
B01 1190 13    mental health field to be too low. Kansas, regarded
B01 1200  9    as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally
B01 1210  6    ill, spends $9 per day per patient.
B01 1220  1       Georgia has made some reforms, true. The intensive
B01 1220  9    treatment program is working well. But in so many other
B01 1230  9    areas we still are dragging.
B01 1240  1       Considering what is being done compared to what
B01 1240  9    needs to be done, it behooves the hospital management
B01 1250  7    to do some mighty careful planning toward making the
B01 1260  4    best possible use of the increase granted. The boost
B01 1270  2    is helpful but inadequate.- @
B01 1280  1    #THE END OF TRUJILLO#
B01 1280  5    Assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive to men
B01 1290  3    of good conscience. Rafael Trujillo, the often-blood
B01 1290 11    thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years,
B01 1300  9    perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal
B01 1310  8    of history. But whether the murder of El Benefactor
B01 1320  4    in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of
B01 1330  2    the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now
B01 1330 11    be answered.
B01 1340  1       Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination.
B01 1340  8    The responsibility for scores of deaths, including
B01 1350  6    the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez, a
B01 1360  4    professor at Columbia University in New York, has been
B01 1370  3    laid at his door. He had been involved in countless
B01 1370 13    schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring
B01 1380  9    countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela.
B01 1390  7    It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of
B01 1400  7    his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan
B01 1410  3    government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican
B01 1420  1    arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez,
B01 1420  9    has been uncovered and quashed.
B01 1430  5       The recent history of the Dominican Republic is
B01 1440  3    an almost classical study of the way in which even
B01 1440 13    a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become
B01 1450  6    oppressive. Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things
B01 1460  6    for his country: he improved public facilities such
B01 1470  4    as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and investment
B01 1480  2    and raised the standard of living notably. But the
B01 1480 11    price was the silence of the grave for all criticism
B01 1490 10    or opposition.
B01 1500  1       El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth.
B01 1500  9    The jails were filled to overflowing with political
B01 1510  6    prisoners who had incurred his displeasure. He maintained
B01 1520  4    amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere
B01 1530  3    which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his influence
B01 1540  2    extended even to Congress.
B01 1540  6       Until the last year or so the profession of friendship
B01 1550  5    with the United States had been an article of faith
B01 1560  3    with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession
B01 1570  1    was accepted here as evidence of his good character.
B01 1570 10    Tardily the Government here came to understand how
B01 1590  5    this country's own reputation was tarnished by the
B01 1600  4    association with repression. Last year, after Trujillo
B01 1610  1    had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean,
B01 1610 10    the United States and many other members of the Organization
B01 1620 10    of American States broke diplomatic relations with
B01 1630  6    him.
B01 1630  7       Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny
B01 1640  5    knows no ideological confines. Trujillo's dictatorship
B01 1650  2    had been along conservative, right-wing lines. But
B01 1660  1    after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing
B01 1660 10    Communist slogans. There was considerable evidence
B01 1670  6    of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba, previously
B01 1680  5    a bete noire to Trujillo- thus illustrating the way
B01 1690  4    in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.
B01 1700  1       What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle. The
B01 1710  1    Dominican people have known no democratic institutions
B01 1710  8    and precious little freedom for a generation, and all
B01 1720  7    alternative leadership has been suppressed. Perhaps
B01 1730  3    the army will be able to maintain stability, but the
B01 1740  2    vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.
B01 1740 10    The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type
B01 1750  7    authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom.
B01 1760  5    Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people,
B01 1770  4    who deserve to breathe without fear. For that reason
B01 1780  2    any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative
B01 1790  1    government to the Dominican Republic will need the
B01 1790  9    greatest sympathy and help.
B01 1800  3    #START ON RAPID TRANSIT#
B01 1800  7    High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial
B01 1810  3    Parkway, operating between downtown Washington and
B01 1820  2    Cabin John, Glen Echo and Brookmont, would constitute
B01 1825  1    an alluring sample of what the new National Capital
B01 1830  9    Transportation Agency can do for this city. In presenting
B01 1840  8    plans for such express buses before the Montgomery
B01 1850  4    County Council, the administrator of the NCTA, C.
B01 1860  2    Darwin Stolzenbach, was frankly seeking support for
B01 1870  1    the projects his agency will soon be launching. Such
B01 1870 10    support should not be difficult to come by if all the
B01 1880 10    plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive
B01 1890  4    as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown
B01 1900  3    area.
B01 1900  4       Because the buses would not stop on the parkway,
B01 1910  2    land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby
B01 1910 11    will be needed. The NCTA is well advised to seek funds
B01 1920  9    for this purpose from the present session of Congress.
