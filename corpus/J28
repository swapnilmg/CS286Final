J28 0010  1    Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant
J28 0010 12    difference between the two groups in their performance
J28 0020  8    on this task after a brief "structuring" experience.
J28 0030  3       It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects
J28 0040  2    would adhere to more liberal, concretistic reports
J28 0050  1    of what the ambiguous figure "looked like" as reflecting
J28 0050 10    their hesitancy about taking chances. This was true
J28 0060  8    mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did
J28 0070  4    not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action.
J28 0080  3    Responses such as "rope with a loop in it", and "two
J28 0090  1    pieces of rope", were quite characteristic.
J28 0100  1    _GUILFORD-MARTIN PERSONALITY INVENTORIES._
J28 0100  3       The three personality inventories (Guilford STDCR;
J28 0110  2    Guilford-Martin GAMIN; Guilford-Martin OAGCo), were
J28 0120  3    filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects
J28 0130  2    and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects. These were
J28 0130 11    the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test.
J28 0140  9    Some predictions had been made concerning factors R,
J28 0150  7    N, I and Co on these inventories which appeared
J28 0160  4    to be directly related to control and security aspects
J28 0170  2    of personality functioning which were hypothesized
J28 0170  8    as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity.
J28 0180  8       Only Co differentiated between the two groups at
J28 0190  8    less that the 5% level (**f).
J28 0200  2       One prediction had been made about the difference
J28 0201  1    in security or self-confidence between those subjects
J28 0210  8    who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed
J28 0220  4    and those who did not. The nonreactors had been separated
J28 0230  4    into two groups on this assumption with the presumably
J28 0240  1    "secure" nonreactors and "secure" reactors being used
J28 0250  1    as the groups for comparative personality studies.
J28 0250  8    It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm
J28 0260  8    reactivity would differ significantly from those who
J28 0270  4    did not on the factor I which the investigators refer
J28 0280  2    to as the "Inferiority" factor. All of the subjects
J28 0290  1    in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups
J28 0290  9    (as defined for purposes of the personality studies)
J28 0300  7    were compared with those subjects who shifted in Conditions
J28 0310  5    III or IV. A t test on these two groups, shifters
J28 0320  4    vs. nonshifters, gave a "t" value of 2.405 which is
J28 0330  2    significant on the two-tail test at the .028 level.
J28 0330 12    #DISCUSSION#
J28 0340  1    _INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES_
J28 0340  3       Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to
J28 0350  3    controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the
J28 0360  1    subjects used in the study. Only 27% (11 subjects)
J28 0360 10    gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely
J28 0370  5    nai^ve concerning the phenomenon. There were 49% (20
J28 0380  5    subjects) who did not give a positive reaction even
J28 0390  2    after they were informed of the normalcy of such a
J28 0390 12    reaction and had been given a demonstration. There
J28 0400  7    were 24% (10 subjects) who shifted from a negative
J28 0410  5    to a positive reaction after they were reassured as
J28 0420  2    to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction.
J28 0420 10       Among this latter group there were also differences
J28 0430  8    in the amount and kind of information necessary before
J28 0440  5    a shift in reaction occurred. One subject changed when
J28 0450  3    given only the information that some people have something
J28 0460  1    happen to their arm when they relax. Five subjects
J28 0460 10    (12%) did not change until they had been told that
J28 0470  9    some people have something happen to their arm, what
J28 0480  6    that something was, and also were given a demonstration.
J28 0490  1    Four subjects (10%) did not change even then but needed
J28 0500  1    the additional information that an arm-elevation under
J28 0500  9    these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction
J28 0510  7    which some people showed while others did not. At no
J28 0520  7    time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject's
J28 0530  4    initial reaction was deviant. The subjects were only
J28 0540  2    given information about other possibilities of "normal"
J28 0540  9    reaction. Those who responded with an arm-elevation
J28 0550  8    in the nai^ve state did not change their reaction when
J28 0560  7    told that there were some normal people who did not
J28 0570  5    react in this fashion. This information was accepted
J28 0580  1    with the frequent interpretation that those persons
J28 0580  8    who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing
J28 0590  7    it. These subjects implied that they too could prevent
J28 0600  5    their arms from rising if they tried.
J28 0610  1       The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition I
J28 0610  8    (the nai^ve state) is not adequately explained by such
J28 0620  8    a concept as suggestibility (if suggestibility is defined
J28 0630  5    as the influence on behavior by verbal cues). In no
J28 0640  4    way, either verbally or behaviorally, did the experimenter
J28 0650  1    indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding
J28 0650 10    to the voluntary contraction. Moreover, when the experimenter
J28 0660  6    did inform those subjects that there were some normal
J28 0670  7    people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed,
J28 0680  5    the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in
J28 0690  2    their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation.
J28 0690  9    They continued to give an arm-elevation. A differential
J28 0700  9    suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain
J28 0710  7    the failure of this additional information to influence
J28 0720  3    the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their
J28 0730  2    nai^ve Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion. Autosuggestibility,
J28 0740  1    the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform
J28 0740 13    to his own expectations of the outcome (i.e., that
J28 0750  7    the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted
J28 0760  5    in the voluntary contraction, because of his knowledge
J28 0770  2    that "to every reaction there is an equal and opposite
J28 0770 12    reaction") also seems inadequate as an explanation
J28 0780  7    for the following reasons: (1) the subjects' apparently
J28 0790  6    genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose,
J28 0800  5    and (2) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations
J28 0810  2    of something else happening (e.g., of becoming dizzy
J28 0820  1    and maybe falling, an expectation spontaneously volunteered
J28 0820  8    by one of the subjects).
J28 0830  4       A suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as
J28 0840  2    an explanation for those who shifted their reactions
J28 0840 10    after they were informed of the possibilities of "normal"
J28 0850  8    reactions different from those which they gave. While
J28 0860  7    they were told that there were some normal people who
J28 0870  4    reacted differently than they had, they were also informed
J28 0880  1    that there were other normals who reacted as they had.
J28 0880 11    There was no implication made that their initial reaction
J28 0890  9    (absence of an arm-elevation) was less preferred than
J28 0900  5    the presence of levitation. A more tenable explanation
J28 0910  3    for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge
J28 0920  1    and increased familiarity with the total situation
J28 0920  8    made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded
J28 0930  8    and to relax, since any reaction seemed acceptable
J28 0940  3    to the examiner as "normal".
J28 0940  8       The nai^ve state, Condition I, could therefore
J28 0950  7    be viewed as an inhibiting one for 24% of the subjects
J28 0960  7    in this study. They were not free to be themselves
J28 0970  4    in this situation, an interpersonal one, where there
J28 0980  1    was an observer of their reactions and they had no
J28 0980 11    guide for acceptable behavior. Instructions to relax,
J28 0990  5    i.e., to be "spontaneous", and react immediately to
J28 1000  5    whatever impulse they might have, was not sufficiently
J28 1010  1    reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of
J28 1010  9    normal reactions had been given. While other conditions
J28 1020  7    might be even more effective in bringing about a change
J28 1030  6    from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity,
J28 1040  2    it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would
J28 1050  1    have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude
J28 1050 12    in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself
J28 1060  7    temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his
J28 1070  4    behavior.
J28 1070  5       Alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility
J28 1080  3    to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject (the
J28 1090  2    only one with whom this technique was tried). This
J28 1090 11    subject, who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy
J28 1100  6    for five years, did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction
J28 1110  7    under any of the four standardized conditions used
J28 1120  3    in this experiment while sober. After two drinks containing
J28 1130  2    alcohol, her arm flew upward very freely. There was
J28 1130 11    evident delight on the part of the subject in response
J28 1140 10    to her experience of the freedom of movement. She described
J28 1150  7    herself as having the same kind of "irresponsible"
J28 1160  3    feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis.
J28 1170  1    She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the
J28 1170 10    effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing
J28 1180  8    from her the controls which she felt so compulsively
J28 1190  5    necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate
J28 1200  3    to relax these controls.
J28 1200  7       Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm
J28 1210  3    reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective
J28 1220  1    control- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects
J28 1220  7    perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative
J28 1230  8    subjects perceived it. These suggested interpretations
J28 1240  4    were given by the subjects spontaneously when they
J28 1250  3    were told that there were people who reacted differently
J28 1260  1    than they had. The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described
J28 1260  9    the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one
J28 1270  9    in which they exercised no control. They explained
J28 1280  4    its absence in others on the basis of an intervention
J28 1290  1    of control factors. They felt that they too could counteract
J28 1300  1    the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after
J28 1300 10    they had once experienced the reaction. Some of those
J28 1310  6    who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also
J28 1320  5    associated their behavior in the situation with control
J28 1330  2    factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily.
J28 1340  1    One subject spontaneously asked (after her arm had
J28 1340  9    finally risen), "Do you suppose I was unconsciously
J28 1350  6    keeping it down before"? Another said that her arm
J28 1360  5    did not go up at first "because I wouldn't let it;
J28 1370  3    I thought it wasn't supposed to". This subject was
J28 1371  1    one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in
J28 1380 11    the nai^ve state but not in the first. She had felt
J28 1390  8    that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial, but
J28 1400  4    had consciously prevented it from so doing. She explained
J28 1410  2    nonreactivity of others by saying that they were "not
J28 1410 11    letting themselves relax". When informed that there
J28 1420  7    were some persons who did not have their arm go up,
J28 1430  8    she commented, "I don't see how they can prevent it".
J28 1440  5    In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for
J28 1450  2    nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects,
J28 1450  9    the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control
J28 1460  6    hypothesis to explain nonreactivity. They felt that
J28 1470  7    they were relaxing as much as they could and that any
J28 1480  6    control factors which might be present to prevent response
J28 1490  2    must be on an unconscious level.
J28 1490  8       The above discussion does not mean to imply that
J28 1500  7    control factors were completely in abeyance in the
J28 1510  4    Kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could
J28 1520  1    be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation.
J28 1530  1    One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise
J28 1530 10    while being tested in the nai^ve condition described
J28 1540  6    her subjective experience as follows: "You feel they're
J28 1550  5    going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for
J28 1560  5    them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's
J28 1570  2    supposed to happen". She then described her experience
J28 1570 10    as one in which she first had difficulty accepting
J28 1580  9    for herself a state of being in which she relinquished
J28 1590  6    control. However, she was able to relax and yield to
J28 1600  4    the moment.
J28 1600  6       It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects
J28 1610  2    are less hesitant about relinquishing control than
J28 1610  9    are Kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give
J28 1620  8    up their control and allow themselves to be reactors
J28 1630  6    rather than actors. It is our belief that this readiness
J28 1640  4    to relinquish some control was evidenced by the
J28 1640 12    Kohnstamm-positive
J28 1650  1    subjects in some of the other experimental situations
J28 1660  1    to be discussed below. Thus, this readiness to relax
J28 1660 10    controls, evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation, appears
J28 1670  6    to be a more general personality factor.
J28 1680  2    _ANISEIKONIC ILLUSION_
J28 1680  4       The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer
J28 1690  5    to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible
J28 1700  1    in the external world. There was a significantly greater
J28 1700 10    number in this group who reported a desk as being in
J28 1710 11    a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it
J28 1720  7    remained stationary on the incline. This occurred in
J28 1730  3    spite of the rational awareness that the ball should
J28 1730 12    be going downhill. They knew that their perceptual
J28 1750  7    experience differed from objective reality since they
J28 1760  5    had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the
J28 1770  3    aniseikonic lenses. Yet they were not so bound by past
J28 1770 13    experience and constriction as to deny their immediate
J28 1780  8    perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge
J28 1790  6    of what the experience should be. The change in perceptions
J28 1800  4    by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects, after they
J28 1810  3    had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions,
J28 1820  1    suggests that their constriction and guardedness is
J28 1820  8    associated with their general mode of responding to
J28 1830  7    strange or unknown situations. They were able to experience
J28 1840  5    at first, in terms of past conventionality. When informed
J28 1850  3    as to the various possibilities of normal reactions,
J28 1850 11    they were then able to experience the uniqueness of
J28 1860  9    the present. It might be postulated that these subjects
J28 1870  6    are unduly afraid of being wrong; that they perceive
J28 1880  4    new internal and environmental situations as "threatening"
J28 1890  1    until they are tested and proved otherwise.
J28 1890  8       While the interpretations that have been given are
J28 1900  8    inferences only, they gain support from such comments
J28 1910  6    as the following, which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative
J28 1920  5    subjects who did not, on the first trial, perceive
J28 1930  2    the tilt illusion.
