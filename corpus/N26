N26 0010  1       CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated
N26 0010  8    their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed
N26 0020  8    open the swing doors and walked towards the bar. Only
N26 0030  6    Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were. Blue
N26 0040  4    Throat was slumped with his back against the bar, elbows
N26 0050  1    supporting his massive frame. He leered at the stranger
N26 0050 10    as the distance between them closed.
N26 0060  5       "Since when did they allow beardless kids into the
N26 0070  4    saloon bars of this town, boys"? he asked. "Seems to
N26 0080  2    me I don't remember altering any law about that".
N26 0090  1       He straightened up, alert now as the buffalo hunter
N26 0090 10    came closer. "Stay right here where you are, kid",
N26 0100  7    he called. "I don't aim to have minors breathing down
N26 0110  6    my neck when I'm a-drinking":
N26 0120  1       The stranger ignored him. He didn't stop till he
N26 0120 10    was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time
N26 0130  9    the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his
N26 0140  8    revolver.
N26 0140  9       "I'm Billy Tilghman", said the stranger, "and I've
N26 0150  6    come for Pat Conyers' body".
N26 0160  1       "And what makes you think you're going to get it,
N26 0160 11    pretty boy"?
N26 0170  2       "Because I'm asking. Most of the time I get what
N26 0180  2    I ask for".
N26 0180  5       Blue Throat winked at his six cronies. "The kid
N26 0190  3    has no manners, boys. Shall we teach him some"? His
N26 0200  1    gun was half drawn when he asked the question, but
N26 0200 11    the weapon never left its holster. Tilghman's clenched
N26 0210  6    fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped
N26 0220  5    the big gunfighter on the side of his chin. His head
N26 0230  2    snapped round and he reeled back, crashing into the
N26 0230 11    table where his buddies were sprawling.
N26 0240  5       Tilghman leapt on to him, dragged him upright and
N26 0250  4    hit him again, this time sending him careening against
N26 0260  1    the bar. A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from
N26 0260 13    Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started
N26 0270  7    shooting. Tilghman flung himself aside, dropped on
N26 0280  6    one knee and pulled his own gun.
N26 0290  1       The Colt roared twice and two men dropped, writhing.
N26 0290 10    A third shot doused the light. Somewhere at the far
N26 0300  8    end of the room a voice yelled, "You all right, Billy"?
N26 0310  5       "Yes, George, but I ain't got poor old Pat's body
N26 0320  6    yet. And I aim to have it". He fired again, and somewhere
N26 0330  4    in the gloom a man screamed. Another took off his gun
N26 0340  3    belt and flung his weapons to the floor. "OK, Tilghman,
N26 0350  1    I'm quitting".
N26 0350  3       "And me", said another Blue Throat henchman.
N26 0360  2       Somebody brought a light. Tilghman and his partner,
N26 0370  1    George Rust, herded the men into a corner. "And now",
N26 0370 11    said Tilghman with deadly calm, "I'll repeat what I
N26 0380  8    said. I've come for Pat Conyers' body".
N26 0390  5       In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade,
N26 0400  3    who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl
N26 0410  2    the previous night, was carried into the town's funeral
N26 0420  1    parlor to be prepared for decent burial. Blue Throat,
N26 0420 10    nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded
N26 0430  8    pride, rode out of town with the survivors of the fight.
N26 0440  5       "That critter will be back tomorrow", predicted
N26 0450  2    George Rust, "and he'll bring fifty of his kind back
N26 0460  2    with him. Blue Throat won't stand for this. He'll shoot
N26 0460 12    up the town".
N26 0470  3       The prediction was correct. The Reverend James Doran
N26 0480  2    had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot
N26 0490  1    Hill in the township of Petrie, when shots were heard
N26 0490 11    in the distance.
N26 0500  1       "Amen", said the Reverend Doran, grabbing his rifle
N26 0500  9    propped up against a tombstone, "and now my brethren,
N26 0510  9    it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere".
N26 0520  6       Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the
N26 0530  7    battle. Blue Throat, who had ruled the town with his
N26 0540  4    six-shooter for the last six months, certainly had
N26 0540 13    no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship.
N26 0550  6    It was essential that he should restore his formidable
N26 0560  7    reputation as a rip-roaring, ruthless gun-slinger,
N26 0570  4    and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing
N26 0580  3    it.
N26 0580  4       He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and
N26 0590  1    liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn
N26 0590 10    at the entrance to Main Street. The entire length of
N26 0600  8    the street could be raked with rifle fire from this
N26 0610  5    barn. Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue
N26 0620  2    Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly
N26 0620 11    burst of fire.
N26 0630  3       The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered
N26 0640  1    inside Kaster's Store, halfway down the street. Several
N26 0640  9    were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived.
N26 0650  8    He sized up the situation and shook his head.
N26 0660  5       "If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped
N26 0670  5    up in here for days", he said. "There's only one thing
N26 0680  3    to move him fast, and we have it right here in this
N26 0680 15    very store".
N26 0690  2       He called the store owner and together they went
N26 0690 11    into the stockroom. Billy returned with six sticks
N26 0700  8    of dynamite. "I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's
N26 0710  7    lap", he announced, "and I'd like every gun to be firing
N26 0720  8    into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em
N26 0730  5    through the window".
N26 0730  8       He slipped outside, hugging the walls of buildings
N26 0740  6    and dodging into doorways. Blue Throat's men spotted
N26 0750  3    him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts
N26 0760  1    and board walk as he passed.
N26 0760  7       Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside
N26 0770  4    a barber's shop and came out at the back. Here he couldn't
N26 0780  2    be seen by Blue Throat and his gang. All he had to
N26 0780 14    do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks, run
N26 0790 10    to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and
N26 0800  8    hurl the sticks through.
N26 0800 12       Billy Tilghman did just that. Within seconds the
N26 0810  8    big barn was blasted into smoking splinters, with every
N26 0820  5    outlaw either dead or injured inside. It was the abrupt
N26 0830  5    end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie. Though
N26 0840  1    only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never
N26 0840  9    returned to those parts.
N26 0850  3       To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long
N26 0860  1    list of hair-raising, smash-'em-down adventures on
N26 0860 10    the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was
N26 0870  9    only eighteen years old, and did not end till fifty
N26 0880  5    years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk
N26 0890  3    to be quiet.
N26 0890  6       Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of
N26 0900  2    the Old West, "Uncle Billy Tilghman" stands out head
N26 0900 11    and shoulders. He was the lawman who survived more
N26 0910  9    gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character
N26 0920  6    in the book. He saw the most action, beat up more badmen
N26 0930  5    with his bare fists, broke up the most gangs and sent
N26 0940  2    more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal
N26 0950  1    who lived before or after him.
N26 0950  7       For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot
N26 0960  5    holes through and battered the daylights out of the
N26 0970  1    enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the
N26 0970 12    West.
N26 0980  1       The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws
N26 0980  8    have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship,
N26 0990  8    but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the
N26 1000  4    side of the law throughout his action-packed career,
N26 1010  1    his achievements and the appalling risks he took while
N26 1010 10    taming the West have remained almost unsung.
N26 1020  6       Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected
N26 1030  5    to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway, but this
N26 1040  3    fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period
N26 1040 14    of half a century.
N26 1050  4       He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets
N26 1060  1    during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized
N26 1060 11    Oklahoma in the 1890's. Led by Bill Doolin, these mobsters
N26 1070 10    specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they
N26 1080  9    looted stores and robbed banks, making liberal use
N26 1090  5    of their guns. Bill Doolin's ambition, it appeared,
N26 1100  3    was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those
N26 1100 13    of Jesse James and Billy the Kid, and Bill Tilghman
N26 1110 10    had sworn he would stop him.
N26 1120  3       Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove
N26 1140  1    with the Doolin gang. They bought rustled cattle from
N26 1140 10    the outlaw, kept him supplied with guns and ammunition,
N26 1150  8    harbored his men in their houses. Billy decided to
N26 1160  5    set an example by arresting one of the ranchers, named
N26 1170  2    Ed Dunn, who lived at Rock Fort.
N26 1170  9       On a bitterly cold day in January, 1895, accompanied
N26 1180  7    only by Neal Brown as his deputy, Tilghman left the
N26 1190  5    township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's
N26 1200  3    ranch. It was snowing hard when they got there and
N26 1210  1    they saw no horses outside. The only evidence of occupation
N26 1210 11    came from the chimney, which was belching out thick
N26 1220  8    smoke.
N26 1220  9       The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards
N26 1230  7    from the door. "Wait here, Neal", said Tilghman. "If
N26 1240  5    I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town
N26 1250  6    and bring out a posse".
N26 1250 11       Leaving his rifle in the wagon, Tilghman walked
N26 1260  6    up to the door and hammered on it. There was no reply
N26 1270  5    so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside.
N26 1280  1    Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire,
N26 1280 10    a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day. Seated near
N26 1290  8    it with his back to the door was the rancher, Ed Dunn.
N26 1300  6       "Hello, Ed", said Tilghman. The rancher grunted
N26 1310  4    an acknowledgement but didn't move.
N26 1320  1       Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards
N26 1320  9    the fire. Suddenly he saw something which made his
N26 1330  7    big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs
N26 1340  5    to bristle on the back of his neck. Along each side
N26 1350  1    of the room were six tiered bunks, each one screened
N26 1350 11    off with a curtain.
N26 1360  1       And projecting wickedly through these curtains were
N26 1360  8    the gleaming muzzles of six rifles, all trained on
N26 1370  9    Billy Tilghman. The fighting marshal had walked right
N26 1380  6    into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam
N26 1390  3    into his hide.
N26 1390  6       Thinking fast, Tilghman never hesitated for one
N26 1400  4    instant. He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully
N26 1410  1    unaware of the guns covering him. The men behind them
N26 1410 11    were Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a
N26 1420 11    killer.
N26 1420 12       "Cold day", said Tilghman, placing his hands behind
N26 1430  8    him and casually presenting his backside to the fire.
N26 1440  7    "Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives. Can't
N26 1450  5    seem to locate landmarks in this snow".
N26 1460  1       The rancher was trembling. He wouldn't look Tilghman
N26 1460  9    in the face. "Follow the river for five miles", he
N26 1470 10    said hoarsely. "Jed's homestead is on the south bank".
N26 1480  7       Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself
N26 1490  5    out of that bristling death-trap, Tilghman deliberately
N26 1500  3    engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation
N26 1510  1    for a good ten minutes. All that time rifle barrels
N26 1510 11    were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body. One
N26 1520  8    false move on his part and he would be a dead man.
N26 1530  7       "Well", he announced, "Guess I'll be going now,
N26 1540  4    Ed, and thanks for the warmup". He strolled back to
N26 1550  2    the door, whistling softly, hands still clasped behind
N26 1550 10    him. He left the house and almost certain death without
N26 1560  9    even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable
N26 1570  6    stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out
N26 1580  5    alive.
N26 1580  6       But he knew well enough that those guns would still
N26 1590  4    be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon.
N26 1600  1    If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going
N26 1600 11    back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot
N26 1610  9    down instantly.
N26 1610 11       Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal
N26 1620 10    Brown. "Don't say or do anything", he said softly.
N26 1630  6    "Just get out of here without it looking as though
N26 1640  3    we're in a hurry. That place is crawling with Bill
N26 1650  1    Doolin and his gang".
N26 1650  5       Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life
N26 1660  3    hung on a thread. Back in the house a hoodlum named
N26 1670  1    Red Buck, sore because Billy had been allowed to leave
N26 1670 11    unscathed, jumped from a bunk and swore he was going
N26 1680 10    after him to kill him right then.
N26 1690  2       "You'll stay right here", commanded Bill Doolin,
N26 1700  1    covering Red with his rifle. "Billy Tilghman is too
N26 1700 10    good a man to shoot in the back. We'll let him go".
N26 1710 10       But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity
N26 1720  7    from violent death came to a full and final stop one
N26 1730  6    night in a street at Cromwell, Oklahoma, where he had
N26 1740  3    been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets.
N26 1750  1       Wiley Lynn, a self-styled prohibition officer, had
N26 1750  8    hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever
N26 1760  7    since. That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance
N26 1770  5    hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting
N26 1780  1    off his revolver.
