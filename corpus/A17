A17 0530  9       Mr. and Mrs. Andrew S. Kelsey of Washington, D.C.,
A17 0540  7    announce the birth of a daughter, Kira Ann Kelsey,
A17 0550  7    on Monday in Washington, D.C.
A17 0560  2       Grandparents are Mr. and Mrs. R.L. Rickenbaugh and
A17 0570  3    Mr. and Mrs. E.O. Kelsey of Scarsdale, N.Y.
A17 0580  3       Mrs. Kelsey is the former Miss Ann Rickenbaugh.
A17 0600  1       A cheery smile, a compassionate interest in others
A17 0600  9    and a practical down-to-earth approach.
A17 0610  5       Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset
A17 0620  4    at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer
A17 0630  5    st.
A17 0630  6       The pert, gray-haired woman who came to Denver three
A17 0640  6    years ago from Buffalo, N.Y., is a "civilian" with
A17 0650  4    the Army.
A17 0650  6       Her position covers a number of daily tasks common
A17 0660  5    to any social director. The job also covers a number
A17 0670  2    of other items.
A17 0670  5       "Mom" Marr, as the more than 80 men at the center
A17 0675  4    call her, is the link that helps to bridge the gulf
A17 0680 10    between alcoholics and the outside world and between
A17 0690  8    parolees and society.
A17 0700  1       Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing
A17 0700 11    letters there are to be written (and during May, which
A17 0710 10    is National Salvation Army Week, there are plenty),
A17 0720  6    schedules to be made or problems to be solved, Mrs.
A17 0730  5    Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is
A17 0740  3    out.
A17 0740  4       MRS. MARR is the first contact a Skid Row figure
A17 0750  2    talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself
A17 0750 12    up.
A17 0760  1       She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee
A17 0760 12    awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents
A17 0770  8    the rules of the center and explains procedures.
A17 0780  3       "Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society
A17 0790  3    and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle
A17 0800  1    with his fellow men", Mrs. Marr explained.
A17 0800  8       The Denverite has worked out an entire program to
A17 0810  8    achieve this using the facilities of the center.
A17 0820  4       "And I bum tickets to everything I can", she said.
A17 0830  3    "I've become the greatest beggar in the world".
A17 0835  1       IN ADDITION to the tickets to the movies, sporting
A17 0840  8    events and concerts, Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies
A17 0850 10    because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace
A17 0860  8    the sugar in their system.
A17 0870  1       Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to "mother",
A17 0870 11    watching to see that they do not break their parole
A17 0880 10    and that they also learn to readjust to society.
A17 0900  1       By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to
A17 0900 10    the road on vacation trips up and down and back and
A17 0910  9    forth across this vast and lovely land.
A17 0920  2       In another four weeks, with schools closed across
A17 0920 10    the nation, the great all-American summer safari will
A17 0930  9    be under way. By July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers
A17 0940  9    all over the nation will, by 6 p.m., be switching on
A17 0950  7    that bleak- to motorists- sign, "No Vacancy".
A17 0960  2       No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer,
A17 0970  2    probably a hundred times as many gas up the family
A17 0970 12    car, throw suitcases, kids and comic books in the back
A17 0980  9    seat, and head for home. And where is "home", that
A17 0990  5    magic place of the heart?
A17 0990 10       Ah, that is simple. Home is where a man was born,
A17 1000 11    reared, went to school and, most particularly, where
A17 1010  5    grandma is. That is where we turn in the good old summertime.
A17 1020  4       The land lies ready for the coming onslaught. My
A17 1030  2    husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just
A17 1030 13    finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson,
A17 1040 11    Ariz., to New York City:
A17 1050  3    #SET FOR INFLUX#
A17 1050  6    I can testify that motels, service and comfort stations
A17 1060  4    (they go together like Scots and heather), dog wagons,
A17 1070  2    roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms
A17 1070  9    are braced and waiting.
A17 1080  3       I hope it can be said without boasting that no other
A17 1090  3    nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety
A17 1090 10    and beauty of scene, such an excellent network of roads
A17 1100  9    on which to enjoy it and such decent, far-flung over-night
A17 1110  7    accommodations.
A17 1110  8       Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry,
A17 1120  6    but it certainly looks that way from the highway.
A17 1130  6       There are motels for all purposes and all tastes.
A17 1140  4    There are even motels for local weather peculiarities,
A17 1150  1    as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex. There the Royal
A17 1150 10    Motel advertises "all facilities, vented heat, air
A17 1160  7    conditioned, carpeted, free TV, storm cellar".
A17 1170  5    #MANY WITH POOLS#
A17 1170  8    Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming
A17 1180  8    pools ("swim at your own risk" is the hospitable sign
A17 1190  7    poised at the brink of most pools). Some even boast
A17 1200  4    two pools, one for adults and one for children. But
A17 1210  1    the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered
A17 1210 12    the comfort and security of a storm cellar.
A17 1220  7       Motorists like myself who can remember the old "tourists
A17 1230  6    accommodated" signs on farm houses and village homes
A17 1240  4    before World War II can only marvel at the great size
A17 1250  2    and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing
A17 1250 12    motel business.
A17 1260  1    #ALL FOR $14!#
A17 1260  4    At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester, Va., we accidentally
A17 1270  4    drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with wall-to-wall
A17 1280  4    carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade
A17 1290  1    chairs, 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses
A17 1290 12    of pink towels. All for $14.
A17 1300  4       That made up for the "best" motel in Norman, Okla.,
A17 1310  2    where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when
A17 1320  1    we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.
A17 1330  1       Oxnard, Calif., will be the home of the Rev. Robert
A17 1330 11    D. Howard and his bride, the former Miss Judith Ellen
A17 1340 10    Gay, who were married Saturday at the Munger Place
A17 1350  7    Methodist Church.

A17 1390  7    and Perkins School of Theology, SMU.
A17 1400  2       Dr. W. B. I. Martin officiated, and the bride was
A17 1410  4    given in marriage by her father. Honor attendants for
A17 1420  1    the couple were Miss Sandra Branum and Warren V. McRoberts.
A17 1430  1       The couple will honeymoon in Sequoia National Park,
A17 1430  9    Calif.
A17 1450  1       Miss Joan Frances Baker, a graduate of SMU, was
A17 1450 10    married Saturday to Elvis Leonard Mason, an honor graduate
A17 1460  9    of Lamar State College of Technology, in the chapel

A17 1480  4       The bride, daughter of Rhodes Semmes Baker Jr. of
A17 1490  4    Houston and the late Mrs. Baker, was president of Kappa
A17 1500  2    Kappa Gamma and a member of Mortar Board at SMU. Her
A17 1510  1    husband, who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport,
A17 1510 12    La., and the late Mrs. Henry Cater Parmer, was president
A17 1520 10    of Alpha Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at
A17 1530 11    Lamar Tech, and did graduate work at Rhodes University
A17 1540  6    in Grahamstown, South Africa, on a Rotary Fellowship.
A17 1550  5       The Rev. Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated
A17 1560  4    and Charles Pabor and Mrs. Marvin Hand presented music.
A17 1570  3    The bride was given in marriage by her father.
A17 1580  1       She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed
A17 1580 10    with bateau neckline and princesse skirt accented by
A17 1590  6    lace appliques. Her veil was caught to a crown, and
A17 1600  5    she carried gardenias and stephanotis.
A17 1600 10       Miss Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor, and bridesmaids

A17 1640  9    his brother, and groomsmen were Rhodes S. Baker III
A17 1650  7    of Houston, Dr. James Carter of Houston and Conrad
A17 1660  6    McEachern of New Orleans, La. Lee Jackson and Ken
A17 1670  5    Smith, both of Houston, and Alfred Neumann of Beaumont
A17 1680  3    seated guests.
A17 1680  5       After a reception at The Mayfair, the newlyweds
A17 1690  3    left for a wedding trip to New Orleans, La. They will
A17 1700  2    live in Corpus Christi.
A17 1710  1       Miss Shirley Joan Meredith, a former student of
A17 1710  9    North Texas State University, was married Saturday
A17 1720  6    to Larry W. Mills, who has attended Arlington State
A17 1730  5    College. They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh after a wedding
A17 1740  4    trip to Corpus Christi.
A17 1740  8       Parents of the couple are Ray Meredith of Denton

A17 1800  1       She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse

A17 1820  5    headdress, and she carried stephanotis and orchids.
