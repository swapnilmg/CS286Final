E02 0010  1       THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was
E02 0010 10    in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are
E02 0020  9    supposed to like it cool, but those great velvety flowers
E02 0030  7    were healthy and perky in the glaring sun. I sought
E02 0040  4    out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce
E02 0050  1    such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by
E02 0050 10    my question. "I just love them", he said.
E02 0060  7       The more I talked with him, the more convinced I
E02 0070  5    became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming.
E02 0080  2    Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.
E02 0090  1    He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from
E02 0090 10    a pansy specialist. These specialists, I learned, have
E02 0100  6    done a great deal of work to improve the size and health
E02 0110  6    of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their seeds
E02 0120  2    produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size
E02 0120 10    of the unimproved strains.
E02 0130  3       I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants.
E02 0140  2    Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he
E02 0140 11    wanted more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me,
E02 0150 11    soon "run down". It's best to buy them fresh from a
E02 0160  8    dealer who is working to improve them.
E02 0170  1       His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land,
E02 0170  9    but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose,
E02 0180 10    spongy and brown-black. I fingered it and had the feeling
E02 0190  8    of adequacy that comes with the right texture, tilth
E02 0200  4    and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every gardener
E02 0210  2    knows it when his fingers touch such soil.
E02 0210 10       Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies.
E02 0220  9    They germinate quickly, the tiny plants appearing in
E02 0230  5    a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't really matter
E02 0240  3    which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate
E02 0250  1    best when they have a wide variation of temperature,
E02 0250 10    very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours.
E02 0260  8       I like to make a seedbed right in the open, though
E02 0270  6    many people start them successfully in cold frames.
E02 0280  2    Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have
E02 0280 11    things rugged, with only moderate protection on the
E02 0290  8    coldest days. If you do use a cold frame be sure that
E02 0300  9    its ventilation is adequate.
E02 0310  1       For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little
E02 0310 12    sand added to encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it
E02 0320  8    smooth, sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog
E02 0330  5    spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This keeps
E02 0340  2    it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants
E02 0340 12    carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are
E02 0350 10    no ant hills nearby.
E02 0360  1       When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove
E02 0360 10    the board. A light, porous mulch applied now keeps
E02 0370  7    the roots cool and the soil soft during these early
E02 0380  4    days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.
E02 0390  1       When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little
E02 0390 12    plants, it's time to set them out where they are to
E02 0400 10    remain. Every time you transplant a pansy you cause
E02 0410  5    its flowers to become smaller. The moral is: don't
E02 0420  2    transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as
E02 0420 12    they are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches
E02 0430 11    apart where they are to bloom. I put a little scoop
E02 0440  8    of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into
E02 0450  4    each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting,
E02 0450 12    and the better developed the roots, the larger and
E02 0460  9    more plentiful the flowers.
E02 0470  1       Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible
E02 0470 10    to overfeed them. I spade lots of compost into their
E02 0480  9    bed; lacking that, decayed manure spread over the bed
E02 0490  7    is fine. One year I simply set the plants in the remains
E02 0500  5    of a compost pile, to which a little sand had been
E02 0510  2    added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my,
E02 0510 12    or any of my neighbors' experience. In addition to
E02 0520  6    the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water
E02 0530  5    every other week, diluted to the color of weak tea.
E02 0540  2    As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved
E02 0540 10    in water to half the strength in the directions, may
E02 0550  9    be used.
E02 0550 11       They need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings;
E02 0560 11    now we must use a heavy one. Three inches of porous
E02 0570  8    material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and
E02 0580  5    the soil moist and cool.
E02 0580 10       When winter comes be ready with additional mulch.
E02 0590  6    I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops
E02 0600  6    of the plants show right after a good frost. That keeps
E02 0610  2    in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving
E02 0610 11    of alternate freezing and thawing.
E02 0620  4       Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to
E02 0630  4    time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or
E02 0640  1    a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave
E02 0640 12    little blossom or two. If those aren't enough for you,
E02 0650  8    why not grow some just for winter blooming? The pansies
E02 0660  4    I cherished most bloomed for me in February during
E02 0670  2    a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a
E02 0670 12    flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold
E02 0680 12    frame. (An unheated greenhouse would have been better,
E02 0690  6    if I had had one.) The plants took zero nights in their
E02 0700  6    stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass
E02 0710  3    to protect them. In response to the lengthening days
E02 0710 12    of February they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch
E02 0720  8    velvety flowers. That cold frame was my morale builder;
E02 0730  7    its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made
E02 0740  5    my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like strawberries
E02 0750  2    in December, pansies are far more exciting in February
E02 0760  1    than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are
E02 0760 12    so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't
E02 0770  9    take another day of it.
E02 0780  1       The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your
E02 0780 11    plants becoming "leggy", running to tall-growing foliage
E02 0790  7    at the expense of blossoms. Try pegging down each separate
E02 0800  6    branch to the earth, using a bobby pin to hold it there.
E02 0810  6    Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and each
E02 0820  2    of the pegged-down branches will take root and become
E02 0820 12    a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the
E02 0830 11    season. As soon as an experimental tug assures you
E02 0840  4    that roots have taken over, cut it off from the mother
E02 0850  3    plant.
E02 0850  4       A second and also good practice is to shear off
E02 0860  2    the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf
E02 0860 13    or two on each branch. These cut-down plants will bud
E02 0870  8    and blossom in record time and will behave just as
E02 0880  6    they did in early spring. I like to shear half my plants
E02 0890  3    at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while
E02 0890 14    the second half is getting started on its new round
E02 0900 10    of blooming.
E02 0910  1       Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to
E02 0910 11    stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's
E02 0920  8    aim, different from ours, is to provide for the coming
E02 0930  6    generation. That done, her work is accomplished and
E02 0940  2    she ignores the plant.
E02 0940  6       Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for
E02 0950  5    your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably
E02 0960  1    a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy,
E02 0960 12    blooming plants than weak, sickly little things; in
E02 0970  8    fact it is easier. But you will never get better flowers
E02 0980  7    than the seed you grow.
E02 0990  1       Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks,
E02 0990 10    then their period of growth and bloom is over. That
E02 1000  8    is not true. If the plants are cared for and protected
E02 1010  4    over the winter, the second year is more prolific than
E02 1020  2    the first.
E02 1020  4       Would you like to grow exhibition pansies? Remove
E02 1030  2    about half the branches from each plant, leaving only
E02 1030 11    the strongest with the largest buds. The flowers will
E02 1040  8    be huge.
E02 1040 10       Pansies have character. They stick to their principles,
E02 1050  8    insist upon their due, but grow and bloom with dependable
E02 1060  8    regularity if given it. Treat them right and they'll
E02 1070  5    make a showing every month in the year except the frigid
E02 1080  3    ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and
E02 1080 12    more food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.
E02 1090  1       A SALAD WITH greens and tomato is a popular and
E02 1100  8    wonderfully healthful addition to a meal, but add an
E02 1110  7    avocado and you have something really special. This
E02 1120  2    delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in
E02 1120 10    the past thirty years because modern transportation
E02 1130  6    methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere
E02 1140  5    in the United States. It has a great many assets to
E02 1150  4    recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part
E02 1160  1    of your diet yet, you really should.
E02 1160  8       You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit
E02 1170  6    you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped like a large
E02 1180  4    pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin
E02 1180 13    covers a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the
E02 1190 10    consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear, but oily. The
E02 1200  6    avocado should have a "give" to it, as you hold it,
E02 1210  5    when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like
E02 1220  1    a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather
E02 1220 13    bland, nut-like. It is a flavor that might take a little
E02 1230 10    getting used to- not because it is unpleasant, but
E02 1240  6    because the flavor is hard to define in the light of
E02 1250  4    our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes
E02 1250 12    several "eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful
E02 1260  8    quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout
E02 1270  9    the world. Once you become an avocado fan, you will
E02 1280  6    look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation.
E02 1290  3    #NATURALLY DORMANT AND NO SPRAY DANGER#
E02 1290  9    Today, refrigerated carriers have made the shipping
E02 1300  7    of avocados possible to any place in the world. The
E02 1310  8    fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, but it is still
E02 1320  5    firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses,
E02 1330  1    cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed
E02 1330 11    in protective excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to
E02 1340  8    42`F., a temperature at which it lapses into a sort
E02 1350  6    of dormant state. This cooling does not change the
E02 1360  2    avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening
E02 1360 12    of the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature)
E02 1370  9    is restored. This happens on the grocer's shelf or
E02 1380  8    in your kitchen.
E02 1380 11       One of the most attractive things about avocados
E02 1390  8    is that they do not require processing of any kind.
E02 1400  5    There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed. If
E02 1410  3    the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado
E02 1410 10    will delay its ripening until needed. And unlike other
E02 1420  8    fruits, one cannot eat the skin of the avocado. It
E02 1430  7    is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, so that poison
E02 1440  4    sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the
E02 1450  1    consumer.
E02 1450  2    #NUTRITIOUS AND A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER#
E02 1450  7    Good taste and versatility, plus safety from spray
E02 1470  5    poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use
E02 1480  4    of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were
E02 1490  1    limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients.
E02 1490  9    Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty
E02 1500  8    acids, so necessary for maintaining the good health
E02 1510  4    of the circulatory system. Aside from this, the average
E02 1520  3    portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount
E02 1520 10    of vitamins A and C- about one-tenth of the minimum
E02 1530 10    daily requirement, and about a third of the official
E02 1540  8    vitamin E requirement. The B vitamins are well represented,
E02 1550  6    especially thiamin and riboflavin. Calcium, phosphorus
E02 1560  3    and iron are present in worthwhile amounts, and eleven
E02 1570  3    other minerals also have been found in varying trace
E02 1570 12    amounts. None of these values is destroyed, not significantly
E02 1580  9    altered by refrigeration storage.
E02 1590  2       Dr. Wilson C. Grant, of the Veterans' Administration
E02 1600  2    Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University
E02 1610  1    of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if
E02 1610 11    avocados, because of their high content of unsaturated
E02 1620  8    fatty acids, would reduce the cholesterol of the blood
E02 1630  6    in selected patients. The study comprised 16 male patients,
E02 1640  4    ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put on control
E02 1650  3    diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal
E02 1650 12    cholesterol level of their blood. Then they were given
E02 1660  9    1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part
E02 1670  8    of their dietary fat consumption.
