G09 0010  1       Another element to concern the choreographer is
G09 0010  8    that of the visual devices of the theatre. Most avant-garde
G09 0020  8    creators, true to their interest in the self-sufficiency
G09 0030  6    of pure movement, have tended to dress their dancers
G09 0040  3    in simple lines and solid colors (often black) and
G09 0040 12    to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting. But Robert
G09 0050 11    Rauschenberg, the neo-dadaist artist, has collaborated
G09 0060  7    with several of them. He has designed a matching backdrop
G09 0070  5    and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's
G09 0080  4    Summerspace, so that dancers and background merge into
G09 0090  3    a shimmering unity. For Mr. Taylor's Images and Reflections
G09 0100  3    he made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide
G09 0110  2    and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with
G09 0110 12    grass. Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution
G09 0120  7    to the arts of costume and decor. In fact, he calls
G09 0130  7    his productions dance-theatre works of motion, shape,
G09 0140  4    light, and sound. To raise the dancer out of his personal,
G09 0150  1    pedestrian self, Mr. Nikolais has experimented with
G09 0150  8    relating him to a larger, environmental orbit. He began
G09 0160  9    with masks to make the dancer identify himself with
G09 0170  6    the creature he appeared to be. He went on to use objects-
G09 0180  6    hoops, poles, capes- which he employed as extensions
G09 0190  2    of the body of the dancer, who moved with them. The
G09 0190 13    depersonalization continued as the dancer was further
G09 0200  7    metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure.
G09 0210  6    In each case, the object, the color, even the percussive
G09 0220  3    sounds of the electronic score were designed to become
G09 0230  1    part of the theatrical being of the performer. The
G09 0230 10    dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol, begins
G09 0240  8    to feel that it is part of herself. Or, clad from head
G09 0250  5    to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops,
G09 0260  2    the performer may well lose his sense of self in being
G09 0260 13    a "finial". As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments
G09 0270  8    are animized, and the combined elements give birth
G09 0280  7    to a new being. From this being come new movement ideas
G09 0290  5    that utilize dancer and property as a single unit.
G09 0300  2       Thus, the avant-garde choreographers have extended
G09 0300  9    the scope of materials available for dance composition.
G09 0310  8    But, since they have rejected both narrative and emotional
G09 0320  7    continuity, how are they to unify the impressive array
G09 0330  6    of materials at their disposal? Some look deliberately
G09 0340  3    to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply
G09 0350  1    corresponding methods to their own work. Others, less
G09 0350  9    consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends
G09 0360  8    of the times, experiment with approaches that parallel
G09 0370  5    those of the contemporary poet, painter, and musician.
G09 0380  3       An approach that has appealed to some choreographers
G09 0390  1    is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the
G09 0390  9    process of projective verse: "one perception must immediately
G09 0400  8    and directly lead to a further perception". The creator
G09 0410  8    trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that
G09 0420  7    has internal validity because it mirrors the reality
G09 0430  3    of his experience. He disdains external restrictions-
G09 0430 10    conventional syntax, traditional metre. The unit of
G09 0440  7    form is determined subjectively: "the Heart, by the
G09 0450  6    way of the Breath, to the Line". The test of form is
G09 0460  6    fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted by
G09 0470  2    the abstract expressionist painters.
G09 0470  6       An earlier but still influential school of painting,
G09 0480  6    surrealism, had suggested the way of dealing with the
G09 0490  5    dream experience, that event in which seemingly incongruous
G09 0500  2    objects are linked together through the curious associations
G09 0510  1    of the subconscious. The resulting picture might appear
G09 0510  9    a maze of restless confusions and contradictions, but
G09 0520  6    it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially
G09 0530  6    contrived order. The contemporary painter tends to
G09 0540  3    depict not the concrete objects of his experience but
G09 0550  1    their essences as revealed in abstractions of their
G09 0550  9    lines, colors, masses, and energies. He is still concerned,
G09 0560  7    however, with a personal event. He accepts the accidents
G09 0570  5    of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the
G09 0580  3    vitality of the experience of creation. The work must
G09 0590  1    be true to both the physical and the spiritual character
G09 0590 11    of the experience.
G09 0600  1       Some painters have less interest in the experience
G09 0600  9    of the moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities,
G09 0610  8    than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions
G09 0620  7    to a higher, more serene level of truth. Rather than
G09 0630  5    putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek
G09 0640  3    form in the stable relationships of pure design, which
G09 0640 12    symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the
G09 0650 10    perceptual world. The concept remains subjective. But
G09 0660  5    in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight,
G09 0670  3    rather than his immediate impressions, that gives form
G09 0680  2    to the work.
G09 0680  5       Others look to more objective devices of order.
G09 0690  2    The musician employing the serial technique of composition
G09 0690 10    establishes a mathematical system of rotations that,
G09 0700  7    once set in motion, determines the sequence of pitches
G09 0710  6    and even of rhythms and intensities. The composer may
G09 0720  4    reverse or invert the order of his original set of
G09 0730  1    intervals (or rhythms or dynamic changes). He may even
G09 0730 10    alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers.
G09 0740  8    But he cannot order his elements by will, either rational
G09 0750  6    or inspired. The system works as an impersonal mechanism.
G09 0760  3    Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective
G09 0770  2    control of formal development. Again, the composer
G09 0770  9    must select his own materials. But a tossing of coins,
G09 0780 10    with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the
G09 0790  6    oracles of the I Ching, the Chinese Book of Changes,
G09 0800  4    dictates the handling of the chosen materials.
G09 0810  1       Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of
G09 0810  8    continuity for their new vocabulary of movements, have
G09 0820  8    turned to similar approaches. Some let dances take
G09 0830  5    their form from the experience of creation. According
G09 0840  2    to Katherine Litz, "the becoming, the process of realization,
G09 0850  1    is the dance". The process stipulates that the choreographer
G09 0860  1    sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered
G09 0860 11    and that he feel the rightness of the quality that
G09 0870  9    is to follow it. The sequence may involve a sharp contrast:
G09 0880  6    for example, a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded
G09 0890  5    by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle distinctions:
G09 0900  2    the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged, its
G09 0910  2    rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may
G09 0910 11    be transferred to become a movement of only the arms
G09 0920  9    or the head. Even the least alteration will change
G09 0930  4    the quality. An exploration of these possible relationships
G09 0940  2    constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives
G09 0940 10    form to the dance.
G09 0950  4       The approach to the depiction of the experience
G09 0960  1    of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz,
G09 0960 12    or spontaneous, as it is for Merle Marsicano. She,
G09 0970  8    too, is concerned with "the becoming, the process of
G09 0980  5    realization", but she does not think in terms of subtle
G09 0990  4    variations of spatial or temporal patterns. The design
G09 1000  1    is determined emotionally: "I must reach into myself
G09 1000  9    for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly
G09 1010  7    into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts
G09 1020  6    me". Looking back, Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas
G09 1030  5    may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock.
G09 1040  1    At one time she felt impelled to make dances that "moved
G09 1040 12    all over the stage", much as Pollock's paintings move
G09 1050  9    violently over the full extent of the canvas. But her
G09 1060  9    conscious need was to break away from constricting
G09 1070  3    patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape
G09 1080  1    itself.
G09 1080  2       Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity
G09 1090  1    that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial
G09 1090 10    movement. It may be a free front-back swing of the
G09 1100 10    leg, leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops
G09 1110  6    into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the
G09 1120  3    ground. This became a dance called Prelude to Flight.
G09 1130  1    A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building
G09 1130 10    from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the
G09 1140  8    air gives the work its central focus.
G09 1150  1       Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of
G09 1150 10    personal emotion. He seeks to make his dancers more
G09 1160  9    "godlike" by relating them to the impersonal elements
G09 1170  6    of shape, light color, and sound. If his dancers are
G09 1180  4    sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures
G09 1190  1    from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of
G09 1190 10    placing them in the orbit of another world, a world
G09 1200  8    in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities.
G09 1210  3    It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ
G09 1220  2    of form is discovered. In his recognition of his impersonal
G09 1220 12    self the dancer moves, and this self, in the "first
G09 1230 10    revealed stroke of its existence", states the theme
G09 1240  6    from which all else must follow. The theme may be the
G09 1250  5    formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.
G09 1260  1    It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following
G09 1260 12    movements constituting further reactions. It may establish
G09 1270  7    the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and
G09 1280  8    color, in which case changes in the light or color
G09 1290  4    will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs. Unconcerned
G09 1300  1    with the practical function of his actions, the dancer
G09 1300 10    is engrossed exclusively in their "motional content".
G09 1310  6    Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited
G09 1320  5    by emotional bias or purposive drive. But the metamorphosis
G09 1330  4    must come first.
G09 1330  7       Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from
G09 1340  5    pedestrian modes of activity, Merce Cunningham has
G09 1350  3    selected a very different method for achieving his
G09 1350 11    aim. He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity,
G09 1360  7    any line of action related to the concept of cause
G09 1370  7    and effect. He bases his approach on the belief that
G09 1380  5    anything can follow anything. An order can be chanced
G09 1390  1    rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience
G09 1390 10    that is "free and discovered rather than bound and
G09 1400  9    remembered". Thus, there is freshness not only in the
G09 1410  8    individual movements of the dance but in the shape
G09 1420  5    of their continuity as well. Chance, he finds, enables
G09 1430  1    him to create "a world beyond imagination". He cites
G09 1430 10    with pleasure the comment of a lady, who exclaimed
G09 1440  8    after a concert: "Why, it's extremely interesting.
G09 1450  4    But I would never have thought of it myself".
G09 1460  1       The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance
G09 1460  9    is unlike any sequence to be seen in life. At one side
G09 1470 12    of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly; nearby, another
G09 1480  5    sits motionless, while still another is twirling an
G09 1490  4    umbrella. A man and a girl happen to meet; they look
G09 1500  2    straight at the audience, not at each other. He lifts
G09 1500 12    her, puts her down, and walks off, neither pleased
G09 1510  8    nor disturbed, as if nothing had happened. If one dancer
G09 1520  6    slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, sit down,
G09 1530  3    or offer his assailant a fork and spoon. Events occur
G09 1540  1    without apparent reason. Their consequences are irrelevant-
G09 1540  8    or there are no consequences at all.
G09 1550  6       The sequence is determined by chance, and Mr. Cunningham
G09 1560  5    makes use of any one of several chance devices. He
G09 1570  3    may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab
G09 1580  1    bag. The answers derived by these means may determine
G09 1580 10    not only the temporal organization of the dance but
G09 1600  6    also its spatial design, special slips designating
G09 1610  3    the location on the stage where the movement is to
G09 1610 13    be performed. The other variables include the dancer
G09 1620  8    who is to perform the movement and the length of time
G09 1630  8    he is to take in its performance. The only factors
G09 1640  4    that are personally set by the choreographer are the
G09 1650  1    movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and
G09 1650  9    the approximate total duration of the dance. The "approximate"
G09 1660  8    is important, because even after the order of the work
G09 1670  8    has been established by the chance method, the result
G09 1680  4    is not inviolable. Each performance may be different.
G09 1690  1    If a work is divided into several large segments, a
G09 1690 11    last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine
G09 1700  7    the order of the segments for any particular performance.
G09 1710  4    And any sequence can not only change its positions
G09 1720  2    in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.
G09 1730  1       Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method;
G09 1730 10    he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.
G09 1740 10    However, there is always the possibility that chance
G09 1750  5    will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute.
G09 1760  3    Then the choreographer must arbitrate. He must rearrange
G09 1770  2    matters so that two performers do not bump into each
G09 1770 12    other. He must construct transitions so that a dancer
G09 1780  9    who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly
G09 1790  7    the next will have some physical preparation for the
G09 1800  3    leap.
