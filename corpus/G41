G41 0010  1    If she were not at home, Mama would see to it that
G41 0010 13    a fresh white rose was there. Sometimes, Mrs. Coolidge
G41 0020  6    would close herself in the Green Suite on the second
G41 0030  6    floor, and play the piano she had brought to the White
G41 0040  4    House. Mama knew she was playing her son's favorite
G41 0050  1    pieces and feeling close to him, and did not disturb
G41 0050 11    her.
G41 0050 12       All the rest of the days in the White House would
G41 0060 11    be shadowed by the tragic loss, even though the President
G41 0070  6    tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes
G41 0080  4    and to tease the people around him.
G41 0080 11       A little boy came to give the President his personal
G41 0090  9    condolences, and the President gave word that any little
G41 0100  6    boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in. Backstairs,
G41 0110  4    the maids cried a little over that, and the standing
G41 0120  1    invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge.
G41 0120  8       The President was even more generous with the First
G41 0130  9    Lady than he had been before the tragedy. He would
G41 0140  6    bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax
G41 0150  3    a smile to her lips.
G41 0150  8       He brought her shawls. Dresses were short in the
G41 0160  5    days of Mrs. Coolidge, and Spanish shawls were thrown
G41 0170  3    over them. He got her dozens of them. One shawl was
G41 0170 14    so tremendous that she could not wear it, so she draped
G41 0180 11    it over the banister on the second floor, and it hung
G41 0190  8    over the stairway. The President used to look at it
G41 0200  6    with a ghost of a smile.
G41 0200 12       Mrs. Coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among
G41 0210  8    her doll collection. She kept the dolls on the Lincoln
G41 0220  6    bed. At night, when Mama would turn back the covers,
G41 0230  2    she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and
G41 0230 14    place them elsewhere for the night. Mama always felt
G41 0240  9    that the collection symbolized Mrs. Coolidge's wish
G41 0250  4    for a little girl.
G41 0250  8       Among the dolls was one that meant very much to
G41 0260  9    the First Lady, who would pick it up and look at it
G41 0270  7    often. It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist. An
G41 0280  2    accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside
G41 0280  8    the envelope was a name for Mrs. Coolidge's first granddaughter.
G41 0290  9    Mama knew this doll was meant to help Mrs. Coolidge
G41 0300 10    overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future.
G41 0310  8    The name inside the envelope was "Cynthia".
G41 0320  1       The Coolidges' life, after the death of their son,
G41 0330  2    was quieter than ever. John was away at school most
G41 0330 12    of the time. Mrs. Coolidge would knit, and the President
G41 0340  8    would sit reading, or playing with the many pets around
G41 0350  8    them.
G41 0350  9       Now and then, the President would call for "Little
G41 0360  6    Jack, Master of the Hounds", which was his nickname
G41 0370  5    for a messenger who had worked in the White House since
G41 0380  2    Teddy Roosevelt's administration, and discuss the welfare
G41 0390  1    of some one of the animals. It was part of Little Jack's
G41 0390 13    work to look after the dogs.
G41 0400  6       One White House dog was immortalized in a painting.
G41 0410  4    That was Rob Roy, who posed with Mrs. Coolidge for
G41 0420  2    the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy. To get him
G41 0420 11    to pose, Mrs. Coolidge would feed him candy, so he
G41 0430  9    enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did.
G41 0440  6       I would like to straighten out a misconception about
G41 0450  2    the dress Mrs. Coolidge is wearing in this painting.
G41 0460  1    It is not the same dress as the one on her manikin
G41 0460 13    in the Smithsonian. People think the dress in the picture
G41 0470  8    was lengthened by an artist much later on. This is
G41 0480  6    not true. The dress in the painting is a bright red,
G41 0490  3    with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side.
G41 0490 12    There is a long train flowing from the shoulders.
G41 0500  9       Mrs. Coolidge gave Mama this dress for me, and I
G41 0510  9    wore it many times. I still have the dress, and I hope
G41 0520  6    to give it to the Smithsonian Institution as a memento,
G41 0530  4    or, as I more fondly hope, to present it to a museum
G41 0530 16    containing articles showing the daily lives of the
G41 0540  8    Presidents- if I can get it organized.
G41 0550  5       But to get back to the Coolidge household, Mrs.
G41 0560  2    Coolidge so obviously loved dogs, that the public sent
G41 0560 11    her more dogs- Calamity Jane, Timmy, and Blackberry.
G41 0570  8    The last two were a red and a black chow. Rob Roy remained
G41 0580 11    boss of all the dogs. He showed them what to do, and
G41 0590  8    taught them how to keep the maids around the White
G41 0600  3    House in a state of terror.
G41 0600  9       The dogs would run through the halls after him like
G41 0610  7    a burst of bullets, and all the maids would run for
G41 0620  4    cover. Mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell
G41 0630  1    on Rob Roy or not- since she had the ear of Mrs. Coolidge
G41 0640  1    more than the other maids. But she was afraid the First
G41 0640 12    Lady would not understand, because Rob Roy was a perfect
G41 0650  9    angel with the First Family.
G41 0660  2       Every day, when the President took his nap, Rob
G41 0660 11    Roy would stretch out on the window seat near him,
G41 0670 10    like a perfect gentleman, and stare thoughtfully out
G41 0680  5    the window, or he would take a little nap himself.
G41 0690  3    He would not make a sound until the President had wakened
G41 0700  1    and left for the office; then he would bark to let
G41 0700 12    everyone know the coast was clear. His signal was for
G41 0710  9    the other dogs to come running, but it was also the
G41 0720  6    signal for Mama and the other maids to watch out.
G41 0730  2       Rob Roy was self-appointed to accompany the President
G41 0730 11    to his office every morning. Rob Roy was well aware
G41 0740 10    of the importance of this mission, and he would walk
G41 0750  8    in front of the President, looking neither to the right
G41 0760  5    nor to the left.
G41 0760  9       At dinner, lunch, or breakfast, the President would
G41 0770  4    call out, "Supper"!- he called all meals supper- after
G41 0780  5    the butler had announced the meal. All the dogs would
G41 0790  3    dash to get on the elevator with the President and
G41 0790 13    go to the dining room. They would all lie around on
G41 0800 10    the rug during the meal, a very pretty sight as Rob
G41 0810  7    Roy, Prudence, and Calamity Jane were all snow-white.
G41 0820  4       When Prudence and Blackberry were too young to be
G41 0830  3    trusted in the dining room, they were tied to the radiator
G41 0830 14    with their leashes, and they would cry. Mama tried
G41 0840  9    to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied
G41 0850  6    up the sitting room before the First Family returned.
G41 0860  3       Finally, Mama did mention to Mrs. Coolidge that
G41 0870  2    she felt sorry for the little dogs, and then Mrs. Coolidge
G41 0880  1    decided to leave the radio on for them while she was
G41 0880 12    gone, even though her husband disapproved of the waste
G41 0890  7    of electricity.
G41 0890  9       Mama was now the first maid to Mrs. Coolidge, because
G41 0900  9    Catherine, the previous first maid, had become ill
G41 0910  6    and died. Mrs. Coolidge chose Mama in her place. It
G41 0920  5    was a high mark for Mama.
G41 0920 11       Every First Family seems to have one couple upon
G41 0930  8    whom it relies for true friendship. For the Coolidges,
G41 0940  4    it was Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Stearns of Boston, Massachusetts,
G41 0950  4    owners of a large department store. They seemed to
G41 0960  3    be at the White House half the time. The butlers were
G41 0970  1    amused because when the Stearns were there, the President
G41 0970 10    would say grace at breakfast. If the Stearns were not
G41 0980  9    there, grace would be omitted.
G41 0990  1       Speaking of breakfast, the President inaugurated
G41 0990  7    a new custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast
G41 1000  8    table. The word was that this too was part of an economy
G41 1010 10    move on his part. A new bill had been passed under
G41 1020  5    Harding that designated the Government, rather than
G41 1030  2    the President, as the tab-lifter for official meals.
G41 1030 11    So the President would make a hearty breakfast official
G41 1040  8    by inviting Government officials to attend.
G41 1050  4       He caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast
G41 1060  4    hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while
G41 1070  2    he ate. Mama said that if Presidents were supposed
G41 1070 11    to be colorful, Mr. Coolidge certainly made a good
G41 1080  7    president. He knew exactly how to be colorful!
G41 1090  5       The favorite guest of the house, as far as the staff
G41 1100  5    was concerned, was Mr. Wrigley, the chewing gum king.
G41 1110  1    The White House had chewing gum until it could chew
G41 1110 11    no more, and every Christmas, Mr. Wrigley sent the
G41 1120  7    President a check for $100, to be divided among all
G41 1130  6    the help. You can imagine that he got pretty good service.
G41 1140  3       Another good friend of the Coolidges' was George
G41 1150  2    B. Harvey, who was the Ambassador to Great Britain
G41 1150 11    from 1921 to 1923. He had been a friend of the Hardings,
G41 1160 12    and continued to be invited by the Coolidges.
G41 1170  7       The first royalty whom Mama ever waited on in the
G41 1180  6    White House was Queen Marie of Rumania, who came to
G41 1190  4    a State dinner given in her honor on October 21, 1926.
G41 1200  1    She was not an overnight guest in the White House,
G41 1200 11    but Mr. Ike Hoover, the chief usher, had Mama check
G41 1210  8    her fur coat when she came in, and take care of her
G41 1220  7    needs. Mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies
G41 1230  2    she had ever seen.
G41 1230  6       Mama was very patriotic, and one of the duties she
G41 1240  4    was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag
G41 1240 14    that flew above the White House. Actually, two flags
G41 1250  9    were used at the mansion- a small one on rainy days,
G41 1260  7    and a big one on bright days. The wool would become
G41 1270  5    frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind,
G41 1280  1    and Mama would mend it. She would often go up on the
G41 1280 13    roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the
G41 1290  9    evening. She used to tell me, "When I stand there and
G41 1300  6    look at the flag blowing this way and that way, I have
G41 1310  4    the wonderful, safe feeling that Americans are protected
G41 1320  1    no matter which way the wind blows".
G41 1320  8       Even when Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning for her
G41 1330  7    son, she reached out to help other people in trouble.
G41 1340  3    One person she helped was my brother. Mama had told
G41 1350  1    her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was
G41 1350 11    gassed in the war. He was in and out of Mount Alto
G41 1360 10    Hospital for veterans any number of times.
G41 1370  3       Taking a personal interest, she had the doctor assigned
G41 1380  2    to the White House, Dr. James Coupal, look Emmett over.
G41 1390  1    As a result, he was sent to a hospital in Arizona until
G41 1390 13    his health improved enough for him to come back to
G41 1400  9    Washington to work in the Government service. But again,
G41 1410  5    there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the
G41 1420  4    muggy Washington weather, and he had to return to the
G41 1430  1    dry climate of the West to live and work.
G41 1430 10       When Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning, she did not
G41 1440  7    wear black. She wore grey every day, and white every
G41 1450  4    evening. Mama knew that she was out of mourning when
G41 1460  1    she finally wore bright colors. The President helped
G41 1460  9    her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses
G41 1470  5    to get her started. She opened the boxes with a tear
G41 1480  5    in her eye and a sad smile on her face.
G41 1480 15       On the social side, the chore Mama had at the formal
G41 1490 11    receptions at the White House thrilled her the most.
G41 1500  7    It was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs,
G41 1510  5    and, just as the First Lady stepped off the last tread,
G41 1520  2    Mama would straighten out her long train before she
G41 1520 11    marched to the Blue Room to greet her guests with the
G41 1530 10    President. Mama would enjoy the sight of the famous
G41 1540  7    guests as much as anyone, and would note a gown here
G41 1560  4    and there to tell me about that night.
G41 1560 12       One night, Mama came home practically in a state
G41 1570  8    of shock. She had stood at the bottom of the stairs,
G41 1580  5    as usual, when Mrs. Coolidge came down, in the same
G41 1590  3    dress that is now in the Smithsonian, to greet her
G41 1590 13    guests. Mama stooped down to fix the train, but there
G41 1600 10    was no train there! She reached and reached around
G41 1610  5    the dress, but there was nothing there. She looked
G41 1620  3    up and saw that, without knowing it, Mrs. Coolidge
G41 1620 12    was holding it aloft. Mrs. Coolidge looked down, saw
G41 1630  9    Mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole
G41 1640  7    thing fall to the floor. Mama swirled the train in
G41 1650  5    place, and not a step was lost.
G41 1650 12       The Coolidges did not always live at the White House
G41 1660  9    during the Presidency.
