D13 0010  1       If we look about the world today, we can see clearly
D13 0010 12    that there are two especially significant factors shaping
D13 0020  7    the future of our civilization: science and religion.
D13 0030  4    Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power
D13 0040  5    of the universe, the power of the atom. Religion, or
D13 0050  2    the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power
D13 0050 13    to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for
D13 0060 10    all mankind, or whether we misuse this power to leave
D13 0070  7    a world utterly destroyed. How can we have the wisdom
D13 0080  4    to meet such a new and difficult challenge?
D13 0090  1       We may feel pessimistic at the outlook. And yet
D13 0090  9    there is a note of hope, because this same science
D13 0110  5    that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving
D13 0120  3    us atomic vision. We are looking inside the atom and
D13 0120 13    seeing there a universe which is not material but something
D13 0130 10    beyond the material, a universe that in a word is not
D13 0140  9    matter but music. And it is in this new vision of the
D13 0150  7    atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration
D13 0160  1    of our faith.
D13 0160  4    #ATOMIC ENERGY#
D13 0160  6    To see this vision in perspective, we need first of
D13 0170  5    all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power
D13 0180  2    from the atom. You know that I could hold right here
D13 0180 13    in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was
D13 0190 10    the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima. It
D13 0200  6    was only about the size of a baseball; but packed in
D13 0210  4    that metallic ball there was the explosive force of
D13 0220  1    20,000 tons of TNT. That is enough TNT to fill the
D13 0220 12    tower of the Empire State Building; and with the availability
D13 0230 10    of bombs of that size, war became a new problem.
D13 0240  9       Now we might have restricted the use of uranium
D13 0250  5    bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because
D13 0260  2    it is found in only a few places in the world. But
D13 0260 14    we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this
D13 0270  8    new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen
D13 0280  6    bomb. Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce.
D13 0290  4    We know that we have hydrogen in water; water is **f
D13 0300  2    and the H stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen
D13 0300 12    in wood and hydrogen in our bodies. I have calculated
D13 0310  9    that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture
D13 0320  7    to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body,
D13 0330  4    I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of
D13 0340  1    the kind that fell on Hiroshima. I won't try the experiment,
D13 0340 12    but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret
D13 0350 13    and we could all let ourselves go, there would be quite
D13 0360  7    an explosion. And then think how little hydrogen we
D13 0370  4    have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay
D13 0380  2    or in the ocean beyond. Salt water is still **f, the
D13 0380 13    same hydrogen is there. And the size of the ocean shows
D13 0390 10    us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in
D13 0400  6    our hands today.
D13 0400  9       Of course, there is also an optimistic side to the
D13 0410  8    picture. For if I knew the secret of letting this power
D13 0420  5    in my body change directly into electricity, I could
D13 0430  3    rent myself out to the electric companies and with
D13 0430 12    just the power in my body I could light all the lights
D13 0440 10    and run all the factories in the entire United States
D13 0450  6    for some days. And think, if we all knew this secret
D13 0460  3    and we could pool our power, what a wonderful public
D13 0460 13    utility company we would make. With just the hydrogen
D13 0470  9    of our bodies, we could run the world for years. Then
D13 0480  8    think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that
D13 0490  6    we have a supply of power for millions of years to
D13 0500  2    come. It is power with which we can literally rebuild
D13 0500 12    the world, provide adequate housing, food, education,
D13 0510  6    abundant living for everyone everywhere.
D13 0520  2    #AN OCTILLION ATOMS#
D13 0520  5    Now let us see where this power comes from. To grasp
D13 0530  5    our new view of the atom, we have to appreciate first
D13 0540  2    of all how small the atom is. I have been trying to
D13 0540 14    make this clear to my own class in chemistry. One night
D13 0550 10    there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table,
D13 0560  7    and these peas looked to me like a little group of
D13 0570  3    atoms; and I asked myself a question: Suppose I had
D13 0580  2    the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body,
D13 0580 14    how large an area would they cover?
D13 0590  5       I calculated first that there are about an octillion
D13 0600  4    atoms in the average human body; that is a figure one
D13 0610  2    with 27 ciphers, quite a large number. Then I calculated
D13 0610 12    that a million peas would just about fill a household
D13 0620  9    refrigerator; a billion peas would fill a small house
D13 0630  7    from cellar to attic; a trillion peas would fill all
D13 0640  4    the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;
D13 0650  1    and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings
D13 0650 10    in the city of Philadelphia.
D13 0660  1       I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at
D13 0670  1    this rate, so I decided to take another measure- the
D13 0670 11    whole state of Pennsylvania. Imagine that there is
D13 0680  6    a blizzard over Pennsylvania, but instead of snowing
D13 0690  5    snow, it snows peas; so we get the whole state covered
D13 0700  2    with peas, about four feet deep. You can imagine what
D13 0700 12    it would look like going out on the turnpike with the
D13 0710 10    peas banked up against the houses and covering the
D13 0720  6    cars; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about
D13 0730  3    a quintillion peas.
D13 0730  6       But we still have a long way to go. Next we imagine
D13 0740  7    our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the
D13 0750  3    entire globe- North America, South America, Europe,
D13 0750 10    Asia, and Africa, all covered with peas four feet deep;
D13 0760 10    then we have sextillion peas. Next we freeze over the
D13 0770  8    oceans and cover the whole earth with peas, then we
D13 0780  6    go out among the neighboring stars, collect 250 planets
D13 0790  3    each the size of the earth, and also cover each of
D13 0790 14    these with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion.
D13 0800 11    Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky
D13 0810  9    Way; we get 250,000 planets; we cover each of these
D13 0820  6    with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion
D13 0830  4    peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.
D13 0840  1    So you see how small an atom is and how complicated
D13 0840 12    you are.
D13 0840 14    #A SPECK- AND SPACE#
D13 0850  3    Now although an atom is small, we can still in imagination
D13 0860  2    have a look at it. Let us focus on an atom of calcium
D13 0860 15    from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose
D13 0870 13    that I swallow a magic Alice in Wonderland growing
D13 0880  7    pill. I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom
D13 0890  5    grows along with me. I shoot up through the roof, into
D13 0900  3    the sky, past the clouds, through the stratosphere,
D13 0900 11    out beyond the moon, out among the planets, until I
D13 0910  9    am over a hundred and fifty million miles long. Then
D13 0920  6    this atom of calcium will swell to something like a
D13 0930  3    great balloon a hundred yards across, a balloon big
D13 0930 12    enough to put a football field inside. And if you should
D13 0940 11    step inside of such a magnified atom, according to
D13 0950  6    the physics of forty years ago, you would see circulating
D13 0960  4    over your head, down at the sides, and under your feet,
D13 0970  2    some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.
D13 0970 11    These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses,
D13 0980  9    and are of course, the electrons, the particles of
D13 0990  5    negative electricity which by their action create the
D13 1000  3    forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring
D13 1010  1    atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of
D13 1010 11    my finger bone.
D13 1020  1       Since these electrons are moving like planets, you
D13 1020  9    may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center
D13 1030  9    of the atom. So you look down there and you see a tiny,
D13 1040  7    whirling point about the size of the head of a pin.
D13 1050  4    This is the atomic sun, the atomic nucleus. Even if
D13 1050 14    the atom were big enough to hold a football field,
D13 1060 10    this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead.
D13 1070  8    It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive
D13 1080  3    charge of electricity holding these negatively charged
D13 1090  1    electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly
D13 1090  9    all the mass, and the atomic energy.
D13 1100  5       You may ask what else there is, and the answer is
D13 1110  3    nothing- nothing but empty space. And since you are
D13 1110 12    made of atoms, you are nothing much but empty space,
D13 1120 10    too. If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic
D13 1130  7    press and squeeze you down, squeeze these holes out
D13 1140  4    of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge,
D13 1150  1    you would get smaller and smaller until finally when
D13 1150 10    the last hole was gone, you would be smaller than the
D13 1160  9    smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece
D13 1170  6    of paper. Someone has remarked that this is certainly
D13 1180  2    the ultimate in reducing. At any rate, it shows us
D13 1180 12    how immaterial we are.
D13 1190  3    #MUSIC OF THE SPHERES#
D13 1190  7    Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging
D13 1200  8    picture. For we believed that the electrons obeyed
D13 1220  2    the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore
D13 1230  1    the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics
D13 1230 12    the whole is no more than the sum of the parts. So
D13 1240 12    if you are made of atoms, you are just a big machine;
D13 1250  8    and since the universe is also made of atoms, it is
D13 1260  5    just a supermachine. And this would mean that we live
D13 1270  2    in a mechanistic universe, governed by the laws of
D13 1270 11    cause and effect, bound in chains of determinism that
D13 1280  7    hold the universe on a completely predetermined course
D13 1290  3    in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human
D13 1300  3    freedom. And this is why so many scientists a half
D13 1300 13    a century ago were agnostics or atheists.
D13 1310  6       Then came the scientific revolution in the late
D13 1320  4    1920's. A suggestion from Louis de Broglie, a physicist
D13 1330  2    in France, showed us that these electrons are not point
D13 1330 12    particles but waves. And to see the meaning of this
D13 1340 10    new picture, imagine that you can put on more powerful
D13 1350  8    glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look
D13 1360  5    at it in the way we view it today. Now as you step
D13 1370  1    inside, instead of seeing particles orbiting around
D13 1370  8    like planets, you see waves and ripples very much like
D13 1380  8    the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when
D13 1390  5    you drop a stone into it. These ripples spread out
D13 1400  2    in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a
D13 1400 11    great cathedral. And as the waves flow back and forth
D13 1410  9    and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms,
D13 1420  4    you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music.
D13 1430  2    It is a music like the music from a great organ or
D13 1430 14    a vast orchestra playing a symphony. Harmony, melody,
D13 1440  6    counterpoint symphonic structure are there; and as
D13 1450  5    this music ebbs and flows, there is an antiphonal chorus
D13 1460  2    from all the atoms outside, in fact from the atoms
D13 1460 12    of the entire universe. And so today when we examine
D13 1470 10    the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the
D13 1480  8    universe, we are forced to conclude that the best word
D13 1490  5    to describe our universe is music.
D13 1500  1       The Island of Nantucket, part of the State of Massachusetts,
D13 1510  1    lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother
D13 1510 10    State. Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable
D13 1520  9    for living. The Island folk have their living almost
D13 1530  5    entirely from summer visitors; the rest is obtained
D13 1540  2    from harbor scallops. During about three and a half
D13 1540 11    months of the year, in the summer, there are three
D13 1550 10    boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying
D13 1560  5    passengers, food, and cars; but the rest of the year
D13 1570  5    only one boat is needed, which ties up at the mainland
D13 1580  1    nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the
D13 1580 11    daytime. This is a fine trip, too, on a good day. With
D13 1590 11    Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the
D13 1600  8    other, it makes an excellent trip of about three hours.
