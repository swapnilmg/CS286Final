G19 0010  1    Today the private detective will also investigate insurance
G19 0010  9    claims or handle divorce cases, but his primary function
G19 0020  8    remains what it has always been, to assist those who
G19 0030  6    have money in their unending struggle with those who
G19 0040  3    have not. It is from this unpromising background that
G19 0040 12    the fictional private detective was recruited.
G19 0050  6    ##
G19 0050  7    THE mythological private eye differs from his counterpart
G19 0060  7    in real life in two essential ways. On the one hand,
G19 0070  6    he does not work for a large agency, but is almost
G19 0080  3    always self-employed. As a free-lance investigator,
G19 0080 11    the fictional detective is responsible to no one but
G19 0090  8    himself and his client. For this reason, he appears
G19 0100  6    as an independent and self-reliant figure, whose rugged
G19 0110  3    individualism need not be pressed into the mold of
G19 0110 12    a 9 to 5 routine. On the other hand, the fictional
G19 0120 11    detective does not break strikes or handle divorce
G19 0130  6    cases; no client would ever think of asking him to
G19 0140  4    do such things. Whatever his original assignment, the
G19 0150  1    fictional private eye ends up by investigating and
G19 0150  9    solving a crime, usually a murder. Operating as a one
G19 0160  7    man police force in fact if not in name, he is at once
G19 0170  6    more independent and more dedicated than the police
G19 0180  1    themselves. He catches criminals not merely because
G19 0180  8    he is paid to do so (frequently he does not receive
G19 0190  8    a fee at all), but because he enjoys his work, because
G19 0200  4    he firmly believes that murder must be punished. Thus
G19 0210  2    the fictional detective is much more than a simple
G19 0210 11    businessman. He is, first and foremost, a defender
G19 0220  8    of public morals, a servant of society.
G19 0230  2       It is this curious blend of rugged individualism
G19 0230 10    and public service which accounts for the great appeal
G19 0240  9    of the mythological detective. By virtue of his self-reliance,
G19 0250  8    his individualism and his freedom from external restraint,
G19 0260  6    the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle
G19 0270  4    class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing
G19 0280  1    what you please and let the devil take the hindmost.
G19 0280 11    At the same time, because the personal code of the
G19 0290  7    detective coincides with the legal dictates of his
G19 0300  4    society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is
G19 0310  1    in middle class eyes a virtuous man. In this way, the
G19 0310 12    private detective gets the best of two possible worlds.
G19 0320  8    He is an individualist but not an anarchist; he is
G19 0330  6    a public servant but not a cop. In short, the fictional
G19 0340  2    private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's
G19 0350  1    ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions
G19 0350  8    must always and everywhere promote the public welfare.
G19 0360  5    In the mystery story, as in The Wealth of Nations,
G19 0370  4    individualism and the social good are two sides of
G19 0380  2    the same benevolent coin.
G19 0380  6    ##
G19 0380  7    THERE is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement:
G19 0390  6    Adam Smith was wrong. Not only did the ideal entrepreneur
G19 0400  5    not produce the greatest good for the greatest number,
G19 0410  2    he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to
G19 0410 11    monopoly capitalism. The rise of the giant corporations
G19 0420  8    in Western Europe and the United States dates from
G19 0430  7    the period 1880-1900. Now, although the roots of the
G19 0440  5    mystery story in serious literature go back as far
G19 0450  1    as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing
G19 0450 12    decades of the 19th century that the private detective
G19 0460  9    became an established figure in popular fiction. Sherlock
G19 0470  6    Holmes, the ancestor of all private eyes, was born
G19 0480  4    during the 1890s. Thus the transformation of Adam Smith's
G19 0490  2    ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides
G19 0500  1    closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in
G19 0500 10    economic life. Driven from the marketplace by the course
G19 0510  7    of history, our hero disguises himself as a private
G19 0520  5    detective. The birth of the myth compensates for the
G19 0530  3    death of the ideal.
G19 0530  7       Even on the fictional level, however, the contradictions
G19 0540  3    which give rise to the mystery story are not fully
G19 0550  1    resolved. The individualism and public service of the
G19 0550  9    private detective both stem from his dedication to
G19 0560  7    a personal code of conduct: he enforces the law without
G19 0570  6    being told to do so. The private eye is therefore a
G19 0580  2    moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his
G19 0580 12    society. The basic premise of all mystery stories is
G19 0590  9    that the distinction between good and bad coincides
G19 0600  5    with the distinction between legal and illegal. Unfortunately,
G19 0610  2    this assumption does not always hold good. As capitalism
G19 0620  2    in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent
G19 0620 10    upon force and violence for its survival, the private
G19 0630  9    detective is placed in a serious dilemma. If he is
G19 0640  8    good, he may not be legal; if he is legal, he may not
G19 0650  5    be good. It is the gradual unfolding and deepening
G19 0660  1    of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic
G19 0660  9    of the evolution of the mystery story.
G19 0670  5    ##
G19 0670  6    WITH the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock
G19 0680  4    Holmes, the development of the modern private detective
G19 0690  2    begins. Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist;
G19 0700  1    he is very close to being a mental case. A brief list
G19 0700 13    of the great detective's little idiosyncrasies would
G19 0710  5    provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought. Holmes
G19 0720  6    is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing
G19 0730  3    stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced
G19 0740  2    by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse, an incredible
G19 0750  1    egotist, a confirmed misogynist. Holmes rebels against
G19 0750  8    the social conventions of his day not on moral but
G19 0760  9    rather on aesthetic grounds. His eccentricity begins
G19 0770  3    as a defense against boredom. It was in order to avoid
G19 0780  3    the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes
G19 0780 12    became a detective in the first place. As he informs
G19 0790 10    Watson, "My life is spent in one long effort to escape
G19 0800  8    from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems
G19 0810  4    help me to do so". Holmes is a public servant, to be
G19 0820  3    sure; but the society which he serves bores him to
G19 0820 13    tears.
G19 0830  1       The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland
G19 0830  8    Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance
G19 0840  9    of his eccentric behavior. Although he is perfectly
G19 0850  6    willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard, Holmes has
G19 0860  4    nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality
G19 0870  1    of the police. They for their part are convinced that
G19 0870 11    Holmes is too "unorthodox" and "theoretical" to make
G19 0880  8    a good detective. Why do the police find Holmes "unorthodox"?
G19 0890  8    On the face of it, it is because he employs deductive
G19 0900  8    techniques alien to official police routine. Another,
G19 0910  4    more interesting explanation, is hinted at by Watson
G19 0920  2    when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would
G19 0920 11    have made a magnificent criminal. The great detective
G19 0930  8    modestly agrees. Watson's insight is verified by the
G19 0940  6    mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent,
G19 0950  5    Dr. Moriarty. The two men resemble each other closely
G19 0960  2    in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness.
G19 0960  9    The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends
G19 0970  8    with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the
G19 0980  5    edge of a cliff. They are presumed to have plunged
G19 0990  4    to a common grave in this fatal embrace. Linked to
G19 0990 14    Holmes even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego
G19 1000  9    of the great detective, the image of what our hero
G19 1010  8    might have become were he not a public servant. Just
G19 1020  4    as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective,
G19 1030  2    so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both.
G19 1030 10    ##
G19 1040  1    IN the modern English "whodunnit", this insinuation
G19 1040  8    of latent criminality in the detective himself has
G19 1050  8    almost entirely disappeared. Hercule Poirot and Lord
G19 1060  5    Peter Whimsey (the respective creations of Agatha Christie
G19 1070  4    and Dorothy Sayers) have retained Holmes' egotism but
G19 1090  3    not his zest for life and eccentric habits. Poirot
G19 1090 12    and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people;
G19 1100  7    it is true that they are also extremely dull. Their
G19 1110  7    dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the
G19 1120  5    expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism
G19 1130  1    of a Sherlock Holmes. The latter's real descendents
G19 1130  9    were unable to take root in England; they fled from
G19 1140  9    the Victorian parlor and made their way across the
G19 1150  7    stormy Atlantic. In the American "hardboiled" detective
G19 1160  2    story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the mad genius
G19 1170  3    from Baker Street lives on.
G19 1170  8       Like Holmes, the American private eye rejects the
G19 1180  6    social conventions of his time. But unlike Holmes,
G19 1190  3    he feels his society to be not merely dull but also
G19 1190 14    corrupt. Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere,
G19 1200  7    the "hardboiled" private eye can retain his purity
G19 1210  7    only through a life of self-imposed isolation. His
G19 1220  3    alienation is far more acute than Holmes'; he is not
G19 1230  3    an eccentric but rather an outcast. With Rex Stout's
G19 1230 12    Nero Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical
G19 1240  9    plane. Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house, and
G19 1250  9    spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with
G19 1260  5    orchids. More profound and more disturbing, however,
G19 1270  2    is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip
G19 1270 10    Marlowe. In a society where everything is for sale,
G19 1280  9    Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought. His tough
G19 1290  8    honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence.
G19 1300  4    Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues the elusive
G19 1310  3    killer through the demi-monde of high society and low
G19 1320  1    morals, always alone, always despised. In the end,
G19 1320  9    he gets his man, but no one seems to care; virtue is
G19 1330  8    its own and only reward. A similar tone of underlying
G19 1340  4    futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of
G19 1350  2    Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American
G19 1350 12    mystery stories, Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon.
G19 1360  7    Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in
G19 1370  9    search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon; but
G19 1380  6    when the bird is found at last, it turns out to be
G19 1390  4    a fake. Now the detective must save his own skin by
G19 1390 15    informing on the girl he loves, who is also the real
G19 1400 11    murderer. For Sam Spade, neither crime nor virtue pays;
G19 1410  6    moreover, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish
G19 1420  3    between the two.
G19 1420  6       Because the private eye intends to save society
G19 1430  5    in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself in
G19 1440  2    trouble with the police. The latter are either too
G19 1440 11    stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care.
G19 1450  9    In either case, they do not appreciate the private
G19 1460  4    detective's zeal. Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger,
G19 1470  2    Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting
G19 1480  1    each other than they do in looking for the criminal.
G19 1480 11    Frequently enough, the police are themselves in league
G19 1490  7    with the killer; Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides
G19 1500  4    a classic example of this theme. But even when the
G19 1510  5    police are honest, they do not trust the private eye.
G19 1520  2    He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable.
G19 1520 12    Finally, in The Maltese Falcon among others, the clash
G19 1530  9    between detective and police is carried to its logical
G19 1540  8    conclusion: Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect.
G19 1550  6    In order to exonerate himself, he is compelled to find
G19 1560  5    the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend.
G19 1570  1    What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock
G19 1570 12    Holmes now appears as a direct accusation: the private
G19 1580  9    eye is in danger of turning into his opposite.
G19 1590  5    ##
G19 1590  6    IT IS the growing contradiction between individualism
G19 1600  3    and public service in the mystery story which creates
G19 1610  2    this fatal dilemma. By upholding his own personal code
G19 1610 11    of behavior, the private detective has placed himself
G19 1620  7    in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated
G19 1630  5    with crime and corruption. That society responds by
G19 1640  3    condemning the private eye as a threat to the status
G19 1640 13    quo, a potential criminal. If the detective insists
G19 1650  8    upon retaining his personal standards, he must now
G19 1660  6    do so in conscious defiance of his society. He must,
G19 1670  3    in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel.
G19 1680  1    On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his
G19 1680 12    chosen profession, he must abandon his own code and
G19 1690  8    sacrifice his precious individualism. Dashiell Hammett
G19 1700  3    resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery
G19 1710  1    stories and turning to other pursuits. His successors
G19 1710  9    have adopted the opposite alternative. In order to
G19 1720  7    save the mystery story, they have converted the private
G19 1730  5    detective into an organization man.
G19 1740  1       The first of two possible variations on this theme
G19 1740 10    is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. At
G19 1750  6    first glance, this hero seems to be more rather than
G19 1760  6    less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.
G19 1770  1    For Hammer, nothing is forbidden. He kills when he
G19 1770 10    pleases, takes his women where he finds them and always
G19 1780 10    acts as judge, jury and executioner rolled into one.
