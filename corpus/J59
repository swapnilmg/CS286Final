J59 0010  1    Rather than being deceived, the eye is puzzled; instead
J59 0010 10    of seeing objects in space, it sees nothing more than-
J59 0020  8    a picture.
J59 0020 10       Through 1911 and 1912, as the Cubist facet-plane's
J59 0030  9    tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder
J59 0040  6    and harder to deny, the task of keeping the surface
J59 0050  3    at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving
J59 0060  1    contrivances. To reinforce, and sometimes to replace,
J59 0060  8    the simulated typography, Braque and Picasso began
J59 0070  6    to mix sand and other foreign substances with their
J59 0080  4    paint; the granular texture thus created likewise called
J59 0090  2    attention to the reality of the surface and was effective
J59 0100  1    over much larger areas. In certain other pictures,
J59 0100  9    however, Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation
J59 0110  7    of wood graining or marbleizing. These areas by virtue
J59 0120  5    of their abrupt density of pattern, stated the literal
J59 0130  2    surface with such new and superior force that the resulting
J59 0140  1    contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth
J59 0140  9    from which it could be rescued- and set to shuttling
J59 0150  7    again- only by conventional perspective; that is, by
J59 0160  4    being placed in such relation to the forms depicted
J59 0170  1    within the illusion that these forms left no room for
J59 0170 11    the typography except near the surface.
J59 0180  5       The accumulation of such devices, however, soon
J59 0190  3    had the effect of telescoping, even while separating,
J59 0200  1    surface and depth. The process of flattening seemed
J59 0200  9    inexorable, and it became necessary to emphasize the
J59 0210  6    surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing
J59 0220  5    with the illusion. It was for this reason, and no other
J59 0230  3    that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took
J59 0230 13    the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual
J59 0240  7    pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing
J59 0250  5    on paper, instead of trying to simulate its texture
J59 0260  3    in paint. Picasso says that he himself had already
J59 0260 12    made his first collage toward the end of 1911, when
J59 0270 10    he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a
J59 0280  4    painting on canvas. It is true that his first collage
J59 0290  2    looks more Analytical than Braque's, which would confirm
J59 0300  1    the date he assigns it. But it is also true that Braque
J59 0300 13    was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated
J59 0310  8    textures as well as of typography; and moreover, he
J59 0320  4    had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes
J59 0330  3    of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910.
J59 0340  1    ##
J59 0340  2    When we examine what each master says was his first
J59 0340 12    collage we see that much the same thing happens in
J59 0350  9    each. (It makes no real difference that Braque's collage
J59 0360  4    is on paper and eked out in charcoal, while Picasso's
J59 0370  3    is on canvas and eked out in oil.) By its greater corporeal
J59 0380  2    presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed
J59 0380  9    paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push
J59 0390 10    everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than
J59 0400  6    the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever
J59 0410  3    done. But here again, the surface-declaring device
J59 0410 11    both overshoots and falls short of its aim. For the
J59 0420 10    illusion of depth created by the contrast between the
J59 0430  6    affixed material and everything else gives way immediately
J59 0440  4    to an illusion of forms in bas-relief, which gives
J59 0450  1    way in turn, and with equal immediacy, to an illusion
J59 0450 11    that seems to contain both- or neither.
J59 0460  6       Because of the size of the areas it covers, the
J59 0470  4    pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily,
J59 0480  1    as more than an indication or sign. Literal flatness
J59 0480 10    now tends to assert itself as the main event of the
J59 0490  9    picture, and the device boomerangs: the illusion of
J59 0500  4    depth is rendered even more precarious than before.
J59 0510  1    Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying
J59 0510  9    and circumscribing it, the pasted paper or cloth releases
J59 0520  8    and spreads it, and the artist seems to have nothing
J59 0530  7    left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish
J59 0540  4    as well as start his picture. The actual surface becomes
J59 0550  2    both ground and background, and it turns out- suddenly
J59 0550 11    and paradoxically- that the only place left for a
J59 0560 10    three-dimensional
J59 0560 12    illusion is in front of, upon, the surface. In their
J59 0570 10    very first collages, Braque and Picasso draw or paint
J59 0580  7    over and on the affixed paper or cloth, so that certain
J59 0590  7    of the principal features of their subjects as depicted
J59 0600  4    seem to thrust out into real, bas-relief space- or
J59 0610  4    to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject
J59 0610 16    remains imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface. And
J59 0620  9    the surface is driven back, in its very surfaceness,
J59 0630  5    only by this contrast.
J59 0630  9       In the upper center of Braque's first collage, Fruit
J59 0640  7    Dish (in Douglas Cooper's collection), a bunch of grapes
J59 0650  7    is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural
J59 0660  3    effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane.
J59 0670  2    The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed
J59 0680  1    between parallel flatnesses, but seems to thrust through
J59 0680  9    the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth
J59 0690  8    on top of it. Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper
J59 0700  6    strips pasted to the paper, and the only lesser immediacy
J59 0710  4    of block capitals that simulate window lettering, manage
J59 0720  2    somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on
J59 0720 12    the picture plane so that it does not "jump". At the
J59 0730 10    same time, the wallpaper strips themselves seem to
J59 0740  5    be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading
J59 0750  4    charcoaled upon them, and by their placing in relation
J59 0760  1    to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn
J59 0760 11    to be pushed back by their placing, and by contrast
J59 0770  8    with the corporeality of the woodgraining. Thus every
J59 0780  6    part and plane of the picture keeps changing place
J59 0790  3    in relative depth with every other part and plane;
J59 0790 12    and it is as if the only stable relation left among
J59 0800 11    the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent
J59 0810  7    and ambiguous one that each has with the surface. And
J59 0820  4    the same thing, more or less, can be said of the contents
J59 0830  1    of Picasso's first collage.
J59 0830  5       In later collages of both masters, a variety of
J59 0840  5    extraneous materials are used, sometimes in the same
J59 0850  2    work, and almost always in conjunction with every other
J59 0850 11    eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think
J59 0860  8    of. The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed
J59 0870  9    material- or simply of a painted-in form- will be shaded
J59 0880  4    to pry that edge away from the surface, while something
J59 0890  2    will be drawn, painted or even pasted over another
J59 0890 11    part of the same shape to drive it back into depth.
J59 0900 10    Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut
J59 0910  6    through it into real space, and a depth is suggested
J59 0920  2    optically which is greater than that established pictorially.
J59 0930  1    All this expands the oscillation between surface and
J59 0930  9    depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of
J59 0940  7    the surface as well as behind it. Flatness may now
J59 0950  4    monopolize everything, but it is a flatness become
J59 0960  1    so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion
J59 0960 10    itself- at least an optical if not, properly speaking,
J59 0970  7    a pictorial illusion. Depicted, Cubist flatness is
J59 0980  4    now almost completely assimilated to the literal, undepicted
J59 0990  2    kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely
J59 0990 13    transforms the undepicted kind- and it does so, moreover,
J59 1000  9    without depriving the latter of its literalness; rather,
J59 1010  7    it underpins and reinforces that literalness, re-creates
J59 1020  5    it.
J59 1020  6    ##
J59 1020  7    Out of this re-created literalness, the Cubist subject
J59 1030  4    reemerged. For it had turned out, by a further paradox
J59 1040  3    of Cubism, that the means to an illusion of depth and
J59 1050  1    plasticity had now become widely divergent from the
J59 1050  9    means of representation or imaging. In the Analytical
J59 1060  6    phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only
J59 1070  6    had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order
J59 1080  3    to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it-
J59 1090  1    to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth
J59 1090 10    and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional
J59 1100  5    entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of
J59 1110  5    depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute
J59 1120  2    and expropriated property detached from everything
J59 1120  8    not itself. In order to be saved, plasticity had had
J59 1130  9    to be isolated; and as the aspect of the subject was
J59 1150  2    transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable
J59 1160  1    and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity
J59 1170  1    was isolated under the Cubist method, the subject itself
J59 1170 10    became largely unrecognizable. Cubism, in its 1911-1912
J59 1180  7    phase (which the French, with justice, call "hermetic")
J59 1190  5    was on the verge of abstract art.
J59 1200  1       It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted
J59 1200 10    with a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion
J59 1210 10    and representation. If they opted for illusion, it
J59 1220  7    could only be illusion per se- an illusion of depth,
J59 1230  7    and of relief, so general and abstracted as to exclude
J59 1240  3    the representation of individual objects. If, on the
J59 1240 11    other hand, they opted for representation, it had to
J59 1250  9    be representation per se- representation as image pure
J59 1260  5    and simple, without connotations (at least, without
J59 1270  3    more than schematic ones) of the three-dimensional
J59 1270 11    space in which the objects represented originally existed.
J59 1280  8    It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma
J59 1290  9    clear: the representational could be restored and preserved
J59 1300  6    only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion
J59 1310  4    and representation had become, for the first time,
J59 1320  1    mutually exclusive alternatives.
J59 1320  4       In the end, Picasso and Braque plumped for the
J59 1330  4    representational,
J59 1330  5    and it would seem they did so deliberately. (This provides
J59 1340  4    whatever real justification there is for the talk about
J59 1350  4    "reality".) But the inner, formal logic of Cubism,
J59 1360  1    as it worked itself out through the collage, had just
J59 1360 11    as much to do with shaping their decision. When the
J59 1370  7    smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed
J59 1380  4    upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes formed
J59 1390  2    by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to
J59 1390 12    coalesce- become "synthesized"- into larger planar
J59 1400  8    shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity
J59 1410  8    of the picture plane. Left in their previous atom-like
J59 1420  6    smallness, they would have cut away too abruptly into
J59 1430  2    depth; and the broad, opaque shapes of pasted paper
J59 1430 11    would have been isolated in such a way as to make them
J59 1440 12    jump out of plane. Large planes juxtaposed with other
J59 1450  6    large planes tend to assert themselves as independent
J59 1460  3    shapes, and to the extent that they are flat, they
J59 1470  2    also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent
J59 1470  9    silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable
J59 1480  8    contours of the subject from which a picture starts
J59 1490  6    (if it does start from a subject). It was because of
J59 1500  3    this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason-
J59 1500 13    that is, because of the growing independence of the
J59 1510  9    planar unit in collage as a shape- that the identity
J59 1520  7    of depicted objects, or at least parts of them, re-emerged
J59 1530  6    in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued
J59 1540  3    to remain more conspicuous there- but only as flattened
J59 1550  2    silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly
J59 1550 11    in oil before the end of 1913.
J59 1560  7       Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage,
J59 1570  4    but not conclusively; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully
J59 1580  1    begin there. Only when the collage had been exhaustively
J59 1580 10    translated into oil, and transformed by this translation,
J59 1590  8    did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat,
J59 1600  8    interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement
J59 1610  3    created allusions to, if not the illusion of, unmistakable
J59 1620  2    three-dimensional identities.
J59 1620  5       Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone, late
J59 1630  5    in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the point at which
J59 1640  4    he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away
J59 1640 13    from Braque, never again to relinquish it. But even
J59 1650  9    before that, Picasso had glimpsed and entered, for
J59 1660  6    a moment, a certain revolutionary path in which no
J59 1670  4    one had preceded him. It was as though, in that instant,
J59 1680  1    he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting
J59 1680 11    and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back-
J59 1690  8    or forward- to literal three-dimensionality. This he
J59 1700  3    did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward
J59 1710  3    push of the collage (and of Cubism in general) literally
J59 1720  1    into the literal space in front of the picture plane.
J59 1720 11       Some time in 1912, Picasso cut out and folded a
J59 1730 10    piece of paper in the shape of a guitar; to this he
J59 1740  8    glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut
J59 1750  4    strings, thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces
J59 1750 12    in real and sculptural space to which there clung only
J59 1760  9    the vestige of a picture plane. The affixed elements
J59 1770  5    of collage were extruded, as it were, and cut off from
J59 1780  5    the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief.
