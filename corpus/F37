F37 0010  1    The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to
F37 0010  9    all the world was once left to zealous individuals
F37 0020  6    and voluntary societies. But the time came when a church
F37 0030  5    that had no part in the missionary movement was looked
F37 0040  2    upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian
F37 0040 11    education of children, too, was once hardly more than
F37 0050  9    a sideshow, but the day came when a congregation that
F37 0060  6    did not assume full oversight of a church school was
F37 0070  3    thought of as failing in its duty.
F37 0070 10       The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement
F37 0080  6    today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility
F37 0090  5    of a few national leaders in each denomination and
F37 0100  2    a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors
F37 0100  8    and laymen, even though they believe it to be important,
F37 0110  9    assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the
F37 0120  5    province of their parishes. They may even dismiss it
F37 0130  4    from their minds as something that concerns only the
F37 0140  1    "ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed
F37 0140  8    them, who like to go to national and international
F37 0150  7    assemblies, and have expense accounts that permit them
F37 0160  4    to do so.
F37 0160  7       As long as this point of view prevails, the ecumenical
F37 0170  4    movement will be lame and halt. The next stage ahead
F37 0180  3    is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local
F37 0180 14    community. Progress will take place far less through
F37 0190  8    what is done in any "summit conference" of the National
F37 0200  6    Council or the World Council, or even in offices of
F37 0210  6    the denominational boards, than through what happens
F37 0220  2    in the communities where Christian people live together
F37 0220 10    as neighbors. The front line of advance is where witnessing
F37 0230  9    and worshiping congregations of different traditions
F37 0250  5    exist side by side. Until they see the ecumenical movement
F37 0260  5    in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes,
F37 0270  3    programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable
F37 0280  1    aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is
F37 0280 10    a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which
F37 0290  7    we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent
F37 0300  4    separateness of most congregations on any Main Street
F37 0310  2    in the nation.
F37 0310  5    #THE ECUMENICAL CONGREGATION#
F37 0310  8    The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized
F37 0320  9    matter than the relation between congregations in the
F37 0330  5    same community. The decisive question is what happens
F37 0340  4    within each congregation and, finally, in the minds
F37 0350  2    and hearts of the individual members. It is here that
F37 0350 12    the local and ecumenical must meet. It is here that
F37 0360  9    the ecumenical must become local and the local become
F37 0370  6    ecumenical.
F37 0370  7       It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical
F37 0380  7    movement must be "carried down to the grass roots".
F37 0390  3    This way of describing the matter is unfortunate. It
F37 0400  2    implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is
F37 0400 10    ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization
F37 0410  8    at "the top" and needs only to be understood at the
F37 0420  6    so-called "lower levels". The truth, however, is that
F37 0430  3    the ecumenical church is just the local church in its
F37 0440  1    own true character as an integral unit of the whole
F37 0440 11    People of God throughout the world. The other misconception
F37 0450  7    is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only
F37 0460  7    the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension
F37 0470  2    and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended
F37 0480  1    by many national leaders, can be communicated to all
F37 0480 10    congregations. However needed this may be, the fundamental
F37 0490  8    problem is not information but active commitment to
F37 0500  5    the total mission of the church of Christ in the world.
F37 0510  4       The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational
F37 0520  1    polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible
F37 0530  1    to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize
F37 0530 11    that the congregation, as a gathered fellowship meeting
F37 0540  6    regularly face to face, personally sharing in a common
F37 0550  5    experience and expressing that experience in daily
F37 0560  3    relationships with one another, is unique. The idea
F37 0560 11    that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.
F37 0570 10    The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian
F37 0580  7    congregation, but Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism,
F37 0590  4    Taoism, Shintoism, although they have sacred scriptures,
F37 0600  4    priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of prayer,
F37 0610  2    do not have a congregation as a local household of
F37 0610 12    faith and love. Their characteristic experience is
F37 0620  6    that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather
F37 0630  6    than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive
F37 0640  3    kind of fellowship.
F37 0640  6       How far the fellowship in most local churches falls
F37 0650  4    below what the New Testament means by koinonia! What
F37 0660  2    is now called Christian fellowship is often little
F37 0660 10    more than the social chumminess of having a gracious
F37 0670  9    time with the kind of people one likes. The koinonia
F37 0680  7    of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common
F37 0690  6    relation to Christ. It is an experience of a new depth
F37 0700  4    of community derived from an awareness of the corporate
F37 0710  1    indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer
F37 0710 10    puts it, "Our community with one another consists solely
F37 0720  9    in what Christ has done to both of us". This may mean
F37 0730 10    having fellowship in the church with people with whom,
F37 0740  5    on the level of merely human agreeableness, we might
F37 0750  3    prefer not to have any association at all. There is
F37 0750 13    a vast difference between the community of reconciliation
F37 0760  7    which the New Testament describes and the community
F37 0770  5    of congeniality found in the average church building.
F37 0780  3       Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a
F37 0790  3    unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with
F37 0790 12    the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission
F37 0800  9    to the world, a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical
F37 0810  6    movement has been laid. The antithesis of the ecumenical
F37 0820  5    and the local then no longer exists. The local and
F37 0830  3    the ecumenical are one.
F37 0830  7       Of course, the perspective of those who are dealing
F37 0840  6    directly with the world-wide problems of the People
F37 0850  2    of God will always be different from the perspective
F37 0850 11    of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of
F37 0860  9    particular persons in a particular place. Each viewpoint
F37 0870  5    is valid if it is organically related to the other.
F37 0880  4    Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty
F37 0890  1    arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And
F37 0890 10    this is what all too often happens.
F37 0900  5    #DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES#
F37 0900  7    A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded
F37 0910  7    by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at
F37 0920  4    the end of the Second World War. With great difficulty
F37 0930  2    he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to
F37 0930 13    renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee
F37 0940 10    for the World Council of Churches. When he had the
F37 0950  8    mishap of breaking his spectacles, his ecumenical colleagues
F37 0960  4    insisted on providing him with new ones. They were
F37 0970  4    bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical"
F37 0980  1    glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision
F37 0980 13    that is required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal
F37 0990 11    vision, which can see both the near-at-hand and the
F37 1000  9    distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both.
F37 1010  4       As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical
F37 1020  1    tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there
F37 1020 12    are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of
F37 1030 10    the church in its encounter with the world at large
F37 1040  6    that they have no eyes for what the church is doing
F37 1050  3    in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into
F37 1050 14    which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling.
F37 1060  8    Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was
F37 1070  8    so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her
F37 1080  5    son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become so absorbed
F37 1090  3    in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian
F37 1100  1    state in East Germany, the precarious situation of
F37 1100  9    the church in revolutionary China, and the anguish
F37 1110  5    of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he
F37 1120  4    loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular
F37 1130  2    but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service
F37 1140  1    and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face
F37 1140 11    group of individuals.
F37 1150  1       On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed
F37 1150 11    in ministering to the intimate, personal needs of individuals
F37 1160  8    in his congregation that he does little or nothing
F37 1170  7    to lead them into a sense of social responsibility
F37 1180  2    and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking
F37 1190  1    of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction,
F37 1190 10    only in connection with the way in which it serves
F37 1200 10    them and their families. It would hardly be an exaggeration
F37 1210  7    to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches-
F37 1220  6    whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern- is
F37 1230  2    poured into the private and domestic interests of the
F37 1240  1    members. The parish lives for itself rather than for
F37 1240 10    the community or the world.
F37 1250  3       The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the
F37 1260  1    parish perspective appears most starkly in a church
F37 1260  9    in any of our comfortable suburbs. It is eminently
F37 1270  5    successful according to all conventional standards.
F37 1280  2    It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable
F37 1290  1    friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching
F37 1290  9    and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and
F37 1300  7    women living under heavy strain. It provides pastoral
F37 1310  3    care for the sick and troubled. It helps children grow
F37 1320  2    up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible.
F37 1320 12    It draws young people into the circle of those who
F37 1330  9    continue the life of the church from generation to
F37 1340  5    generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast
F37 1350  2    to lose sight of how basic all this is.
F37 1350 11       But what is this church doing to help its members
F37 1360  9    understand their roles as Christians in the world?
F37 1370  4    All too often its conception of parish ministry and
F37 1380  2    pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in
F37 1380 10    their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency
F37 1390  8    for the life of mankind. It is not stirring them to
F37 1400  7    confront the racial tensions of today with the mind
F37 1410  3    of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis
F37 1420  1    involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making
F37 1420 12    them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of
F37 1430  9    our economic and industrial life. It is raising no
F37 1440  6    disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship
F37 1450  1    means for the relationship of the richest nation in
F37 1450 10    the world to economically underdeveloped peoples. It
F37 1460  6    is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary
F37 1470  7    strategy that is called for as young churches emerge
F37 1480  3    in Asia and Africa.
F37 1480  7       To put it bluntly, many a local church is giving
F37 1490  6    its members only what they consciously want. It is
F37 1500  3    not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian
F37 1500 11    responsibility in relation to the world. We shall not
F37 1510  9    make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement
F37 1520  5    until such a church begins to see itself not merely
F37 1530  2    as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian
F37 1530 15    witness and mission to the world.
F37 1540  6       There is a humorous but revealing story about a
F37 1550  4    rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted
F37 1560  1    to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely
F37 1560 12    pleasant community. He built a school and a library,
F37 1570  9    then a recreation center and an inn. Desiring to fill
F37 1580  7    the only remaining lack, he selected the best site
F37 1590  4    on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in
F37 1590 15    erecting it. A visitor to the beautiful little building
F37 1600  9    inquired, "Do you belong to this church, Mr. Rancher"?
F37 1610  8    "Why, no, ma'am", he replied, "this church belongs
F37 1620  6    to me"! The story reflects the way too many people
F37 1630  6    feel. As long as the congregation regards the church
F37 1640  3    as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my"
F37 1650  1    church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make
F37 1650 10    no significant advance. There must first be a deeper
F37 1660  8    sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ,
F37 1670  7    and that it is His purpose, not our own interests and
F37 1680  2    preferences, that determines what it is to be and do.
F37 1680 12    #LOCAL EMBODIMENT OF THE WHOLE#
F37 1690  5    A local church which conceives its function to be entirely
F37 1700  4    that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns
F37 1710  2    of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical
F37 1710 11    as an extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life
F37 1720 11    as a church. It would doubtless be greatly surprised
F37 1730  5    to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really
F37 1740  4    failing to be the Church of Christ.
F37 1740 11       Yet the truth, according to the New Testament, is
F37 1750  8    that every local church has its existence only by being
F37 1760  7    the embodiment of the whole church in that particular
F37 1770  3    place.
