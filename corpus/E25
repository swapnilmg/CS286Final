E25 0010  1       EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of
E25 0010 11    our annual defense budget and most of our readers also
E25 0020  8    realize that a large portion of these expenditures
E25 0030  4    go for military electronics. We have noted how some
E25 0040  2    electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort,
E25 0040  9    have evenutally been used in commerce and industry.
E25 0050  7    The host of novel applications of electronics to medical
E25 0060  5    problems is far more thrilling because of their implication
E25 0070  4    in matters concerning our health and vitality.
E25 0080  1       When we consider the electronic industry potential
E25 0080  8    for human betterment, the prospect is staggering. The
E25 0090  6    author has recently studied the field of medical electronics
E25 0100  6    and has been convinced that, in this area alone, the
E25 0110  4    application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.
E25 0120  1    The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine
E25 0120  9    may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery.
E25 0130  9    We use the term "bio-medicine" because of the close
E25 0140  7    interrelation between biology and medical research.
E25 0150  4       Electronics has been applied to medicine for many
E25 0160  3    years in the form of such familiar equipment as the
E25 0160 13    x-ray machine, the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy
E25 0170  6    machine. Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic
E25 0180  5    vibration machines for deep massage of bruises, contusions,
E25 0200  2    and simple bursitis.
E25 0200  5       Commonly used electronic devices which are found
E25 0210  5    in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV
E25 0220  2    and audio systems for internal paging and instruction,
E25 0230  1    along with radiation counters, timers, and similar
E25 0230  8    devices.
E25 0240  1       In this article we will concentrate on the advances
E25 0240 10    in the application of electronics in bio-medical research
E25 0250  7    laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace
E25 0260  5    equipment originates. From the wealth of material and
E25 0270  4    the wide variety of different electronic techniques
E25 0280  1    perfected in the past few years we have selected a
E25 0280 11    few examples which appear to be headed for use in the
E25 0290  9    immediate future and which offer completely new tools
E25 0300  3    in medical research.
E25 0300  6    #ULTRAVIOLET MICROSCOPY#
E25 0310  1    Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are
E25 0310  8    transparent to visible light and must be stained for
E25 0320  7    microscopic investigation. This stain often disrupts
E25 0330  3    the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.
E25 0340  1    A completely new insight into living cells and their
E25 0340 10    structure will be possible by use of a new technique
E25 0350 10    which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation
E25 0360  4    and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to
E25 0370  3    view the results.
E25 0370  6       Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet
E25 0380  5    microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics
E25 0390  2    Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the talents
E25 0400  2    of a medical man, Dr. Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr.
E25 0401  1    Berkely, and an electronics expert, Dr. Zworykin, this
E25 0410  8    novel technique has been developed which promises to
E25 0420  7    open broad avenues to understanding life processes.
E25 0430  3       Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation
E25 0440  2    are selected by the variable filters placed in front
E25 0440 11    of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the
E25 0450  9    ultraviolet sources. These wavelengths are reflected
E25 0460  5    in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror;
E25 0470  3    the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead
E25 0480  1    of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the TV
E25 0480 11    camera does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon
E25 0490  8    are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet
E25 0500  7    spectrum, which means that all lenses must be quartz.
E25 0510  5       The video signal is amplified and then switched,
E25 0520  2    in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources
E25 0520 10    which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that
E25 0530  9    during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength,
E25 0540  6    corresponding to red, green, or blue, is seen. (Note:
E25 0550  3    Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source
E25 0560  1    to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like
E25 0560 11    assembly rotated by a synchronous motor. This assembly
E25 0570  7    also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics
E25 0580  6    circuitry.) This is the same system as was used in
E25 0590  5    the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded
E25 0600  1    the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers
E25 0600  8    then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a
E25 0610 11    color picture of the specimen where the primary colors
E25 0620  6    correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths.
E25 0630  2       Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent
E25 0640  3    to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter
E25 0670  1    wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different
E25 0670  7    parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different
E25 0680  6    wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal
E25 0690  5    portions of cells in a different color. Where the microscope
E25 0700  4    under visible light may show only vague shadows or
E25 0710  2    nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent
E25 0710  9    translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth
E25 0720  9    of detail.
E25 0720 11       At the present time the research team which pioneered
E25 0730  8    this new technique is primarily interested in advancing
E25 0740  5    and perfecting it.
E25 0740  8    #BREATHING- ELECTRONICALLY ANALYZED#
E25 0750  3    The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation in Man" by
E25 0760  4    Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young, covers a brief paper
E25 0770  4    which is one part of a much larger effort to apply
E25 0770 15    electronics to the study of the respiratory process.
E25 0780  8    At the University of Washington Medical School, the
E25 0790  6    electronics group has developed the "Respiratory Gas
E25 0800  4    Analyzer" shown in Fig. 3. This unit, affectionately
E25 0810  2    dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient
E25 0820  1    location and provides a wealth of information about
E25 0820  9    the patient's breathing.
E25 0830  2       In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates
E25 0840  2    the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from
E25 0840 10    the upper and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume
E25 0850 10    of inhalation per breath, the flow of air from both
E25 0860  7    lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes with respect
E25 0870  3    to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a
E25 0870 12    mouthpiece while walking a treadmill, standing still,
E25 0880  7    or in some other medically significant position. From
E25 0890  4    the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects
E25 0900  3    with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.
E25 0900  9    #HEART-MEASURING TECHNIQUES#
E25 0910  2    The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates
E25 0920  2    irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques
E25 0920  9    allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through
E25 0930  9    the aorta, dimensioning of the heart and its chambers,
E25 0940  7    and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat. For
E25 0950  4    many of these measurements the chest must be opened,
E25 0960  1    but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.
E25 0960 11       A group of researchers at the University of Washington
E25 0970 10    have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these
E25 0980  9    techniques. One simple method of measuring the expansion
E25 0990  6    of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube, filled with
E25 1000  4    mercury, around the heart and record the change in
E25 1010  2    resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance
E25 1010 11    bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation
E25 1020 10    needed.
E25 1030  1       Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the
E25 1030 11    heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite
E25 1040  6    sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one
E25 1050  4    with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel time
E25 1060  2    of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second
E25 1060 12    thus it takes about 16 |msec. to traverse 25 mm. of
E25 1070  7    tissue. A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and
E25 1080  5    time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue
E25 1090  3    evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful
E25 1100  1    measurements of liver and spleen have also been made
E25 1100 10    by this technique. The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic
E25 1110  6    signals, can be employed to measure the flow of blood
E25 1120  6    without cutting into the blood vessel.
E25 1130  1       A still more sophisticated system has been devised
E25 1130  9    for determining the effective power of the heart itself.
E25 1140  8    It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement
E25 1150  3    of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted
E25 1160  2    into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat
E25 1160 10    carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of
E25 1170  9    the velocity of the blood flow. It is also possible
E25 1180  6    to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted at the end
E25 1190  4    of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left
E25 1200  1    ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart
E25 1200 10    itself. This pressure measurement may be made at the
E25 1210  7    same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement
E25 1220  2    is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation
E25 1230  1    for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2. Outputs of the
E25 1230 12    two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit
E25 1240  9    and a resistance bridge, followed by a simple analogue
E25 1250  6    computer which feeds a multichannel recorder. From
E25 1260  2    this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter,
E25 1260 11    pressure, and effective heart power.
E25 1270  5    #RADIO-TRANSMITTER PILLS#
E25 1270  8    Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio
E25 1280 10    transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the
E25 1290  7    patient and which would then radio internal pressure
E25 1300  2    data to external receivers. This original capsule contained
E25 1310  1    a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about
E25 1310 10    1 cm. in diameter. Battery life limited the use of
E25 1320  8    this "pill" to about 8 to 30 hours maximum.
E25 1330  5       A refinement of this technique has been described
E25 1340  1    by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the
E25 1340 11    Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute.
E25 1350  7    In this novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller
E25 1360  8    and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor
E25 1370  6    is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer. As shown
E25 1380  4    in Fig. 4, an external antenna is placed over or around
E25 1390  3    the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short
E25 1390 13    400-kc. bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes
E25 1400  9    the resonant circuit to "ring" on after the burst and
E25 1410  9    this "ringing" takes place at the resonant frequency
E25 1420  6    of the "pill". These frequencies are amplified and
E25 1430  4    detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted
E25 1440  3    energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated, precise
E25 1450  2    internal pressure indications can be obtained.
E25 1450  8       One of the advantages of this method is that the
E25 1460  9    "pill" can remain in the patient for several days,
E25 1470  5    permitting observation under natural conditions. Applications
E25 1480  2    to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are
E25 1490  1    planned for future experiments.
E25 1490  5    #SONAR IN MEDICAL RESEARCH#
E25 1490  9    One of the most gratifying applications of an important
E25 1500  9    technique of submarine detection is in the exploration
E25 1510  6    of the human body. Our readers are familiar with the
E25 1520  5    principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out
E25 1530  2    in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.
E25 1530 11    Various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying
E25 1540  7    these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map
E25 1550  5    ocean floors, and even communicate under water. In
E25 1560  2    medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers
E25 1560  9    and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and
E25 1570  8    different scanning techniques may be used, but the
E25 1580  6    principles involved are the same as in sonar.
E25 1590  1       Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission
E25 1590  9    of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles
E25 1600  8    and blood vessels. Bones and cartilage transmit poorly
E25 1610  6    and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals. Based on
E25 1620  4    this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used
E25 1630  1    this method to "look through" human organs. A good
E25 1630 10    example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation
E25 1640  7    is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who
E25 1650  7    has explored the human eye. He can diagnose detachment
E25 1660  4    of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness
E25 1670  2    due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically
E25 1680  1    is illustrated in Fig. 6. The transducer is coupled
E25 1680 10    to the body through a water bath, not shown. For display,
E25 1690 10    Dr. Baum uses a portion of an **f, an airborne radar
E25 1700  9    indicator, and then photographs the screen to obtain
E25 1710  5    a permanent record.
E25 1710  8       A typical "sonogram" of a human eye, together with
E25 1720  7    a description of the anatomical parts, is shown in
E25 1730  5    Fig. 5. The frequency used for these experiments is
E25 1740  2    15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal
E25 1740 12    with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters
E25 1750  7    smaller than one millimeter. The transducer itself
E25 1760  4    moves the beam in a sector scan, just like a radar
E25 1770  3    antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved
E25 1770 11    over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into"
E25 1780 12    all corners. The total picture is only seen by the
E25 1790  7    camera which integrates the many sector scans over
E25 1800  3    the entire 90-degree rotation period.
E25 1800  9       Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado
E25 1810  8    Medical School have applied the same sonar technique
E25 1820  5    to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely
E25 1830  3    good results. By submerging the patient in a tub and
E25 1840  2    rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on,
E25 1840 10    they have been able to get cross-section views of the
E25 1850  9    neck, as shown in Fig. 7, as well as many other hitherto
E25 1860  6    impossible insights. As mentioned before, bone reflects
E25 1870  3    the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine
E25 1880  2    shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and
E25 1880 12    veins are apparent by their black, blood-filled centers
E25 1890  7    and the surrounding white walls.
E25 1900  2       A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown
E25 1900 13    in Fig. 8 with the various parts labeled.
