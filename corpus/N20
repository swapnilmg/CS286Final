N20 0010  1       They were west of the Sabine, but only God knew
N20 0010 11    where.
N20 0020  1       For three days, their stolid oxen had plodded up
N20 0020 10    a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead
N20 0030  8    sea. Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson;
N20 0040  5    suffocating air sapped their strength and strained
N20 0050  2    their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats
N20 0050 10    and lay like acid in their lungs. And the valley stretched
N20 0060 10    endlessly out ahead, scorched and baked and writhing
N20 0070  6    in its heat, until it vanished into the throbbing wall
N20 0080  4    of fiery orange brown haze.
N20 0080  9       Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until
N20 0090  6    he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen.
N20 0100  5    "Hoa-whup"! he commanded from his raw throat, and felt
N20 0110  3    the pain of movement in his cracked, black burned lips.
N20 0120  1       He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut
N20 0120 11    rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face.
N20 0130  8    He spat. The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth
N20 0140  4    like balled cotton. He moved back to the wheel and
N20 0150  1    stood there blowing, grasping the top of a spoke to
N20 0150 11    still the trembling of his played-out limbs. The burning
N20 0160  8    air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches.
N20 0170  5       He cleared his throat and wet his lips. As cheerfully
N20 0180  4    as possible, he said, "Well, I guess we could all do
N20 0190  3    with a little drink".
N20 0190  7       He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel.
N20 0200  5    They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas
N20 0210  2    sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation. The water
N20 0210 11    was warm and stale and had a brackish taste. But it
N20 0220  9    was water. Thank the Lord, they still had water!
N20 0230  5       He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity. He
N20 0240  2    took a long but carefully controlled draught. He replenished
N20 0250  1    the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the
N20 0250 12    hurricane deck. She took it grudgingly, her dark eyes
N20 0260  8    baleful as they met his.
N20 0270  1       She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to
N20 0270 10    wet a kerchief and wipe her face. She set the dipper
N20 0280  8    on the edge of the deck, leaving it for him to stretch
N20 0290  6    after it while she looked on scornfully.
N20 0300  1       "What happens when there's no more water"? she asked
N20 0300  9    smolderingly.
N20 0310  1       She was like charcoal, he thought- dark, opaque,
N20 0310  9    explosive. Her thick hair was the color and texture
N20 0330  9    of charcoal. Her temper sparked like charcoal when
N20 0340  5    it first lights up. And all the time, she had the heat
N20 0350  4    of hatred in her, like charcoal that is burning on
N20 0350 14    its under side, but not visibly.
N20 0360  6       A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws, but
N20 0370  5    he kept control upon his voice.
N20 0370 11       "There must be some water under there". He tilted
N20 0380  8    his homely face toward the dry bed of the river. "We
N20 0390  7    can get it if we dig", he said patiently.
N20 0400  1       "And add fever to our troubles"? she scoffed. "Or
N20 0410  1    do you want to see if I can stand fever, too"?
N20 0410 12       "We can boil it", he said.
N20 0420  5       Her chin sharpened. "We're lost and burning up already",
N20 0430  4    she bit out tensely. "The tires are rattling on the
N20 0440  3    wheels now. They'll roll off in another day. There
N20 0440 12    was no valley like this on your map. You don't even
N20 0450 10    know where we're headed".
N20 0460  1       "Hettie", he said as gently as he could, "we're
N20 0470  1    still headed west. Somewhere, we'll hit a trail".
N20 0470  9       "Somewhere!" she repeated. "Maybe in time to make
N20 0480  8    a cross and dig our graves".
N20 0490  4       His wide mouth compressed. In a way, he couldn't
N20 0500  1    blame her. He had picked out this pathless trail, instead
N20 0500 11    of the common one, in a moment of romantic fancy, to
N20 0510 11    give them privacy on their honeymoon.
N20 0520  3       It had been a mistake, but anything would have been
N20 0530  2    a mistake, as it turned out. It wasn't the roughness
N20 0530 12    and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened
N20 0540  9    her. She had hated the whole idea before they started.
N20 0550  7    Actually, she had hated him before she ever saw him.
N20 0560  5    It had been five days too late before he learned that
N20 0570  2    she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance
N20 0570 11    of laudanum, administered by her mother.
N20 0580  6       The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped
N20 0590  5    within him like an open wound. She had jumped away
N20 0600  2    from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder.
N20 0600 13    He had left her inviolate, thinking familiarity would
N20 0610  8    gentle her in time. But each mile westward, she had
N20 0620  7    hated him the deeper.
N20 0620 11       He stared at the dipper, turning it over and over
N20 0630  9    in his wide, calloused hands. "I suppose", he muttered,
N20 0640  5    "I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home
N20 0650  5    to your folks, once we find a settlement".
N20 0660  1       "Don't try to be noble"! Her laugh was hard. "They
N20 0670  1    wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd
N20 0680 10    been food enough to go around".
N20 0690  3       He winced. "Hettie, they didn't sell you", he said
N20 0700  3    miserably. "They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer
N20 0700 12    back in Carolina, but out West was a chance to build
N20 0710 11    a real farm of our own. They thought it would be a
N20 0720  8    chance for you to make a life out where nobody will
N20 0730  3    be thought any better than the next except for just
N20 0730 13    what's inside of them. Without money or property, what
N20 0740  9    would you have had at Baton Rouge"?
N20 0750  5       "I might have starved, but at least I wouldn't be
N20 0760  4    fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt"!
N20 0770  1       He darkened under his heavy burn. His blue eyes
N20 0770 10    sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead.
N20 0780  5       To his puzzlement, there suddenly was no haze. The
N20 0790  3    valley lay clear, and open to the eye, right up to
N20 0790 14    the sharp-limbed line of gaunt, scoured hills that
N20 0800  7    formed the horizon twenty miles ahead.
N20 0810  3    ##
N20 0810  4    Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy,
N20 0820  1    ominous, leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced
N20 0820 10    over the crests of the surrounding hills. He had never
N20 0830  8    seen clouds like them before, but he had the primitive
N20 0840  6    feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane
N20 0850  3    in Carolina.
N20 0850  5       He hollered hoarsely, "Hang on"! and goaded the
N20 0860  4    oxen as he yelled. He wanted to turn them, putting
N20 0870  1    the wagon against the storm. Too late, he realized
N20 0870 10    that in turning, he had wheeled them onto a patch of
N20 0880  9    sandy ground, instead of atop a grade or ridge.
N20 0890  4       He swung up over the wheel. "You had better get
N20 0900  2    inside", he warned her.
N20 0900  6       But she sat on in stubborn silence.
N20 0910  1       The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into
N20 0910  9    a great black funnel. Frozen, they stared at it whirling
N20 0920  9    down the valley, gouging and spitting out boulders
N20 0930  6    and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking
N20 0940  4    marrowbones. The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and
N20 0950  2    shake.
N20 0950  3       Their world turned black. It was filled with dust
N20 0960  1    and wind and sound and violence. The heavens opened,
N20 0960 10    pelting them with hail the size of walnuts. And then
N20 0970  8    came the water- not rain, but solid sheets that sluiced
N20 0980  5    down like water slopping from a bucket. Walls of water
N20 0990  3    rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like
N20 0990 12    the crests of flash floods. Through the splash of the
N20 1000  9    rising waters, they could hear the roar of the river
N20 1010  7    as it raged through its canyon, gnashing big chunks
N20 1020  3    out of the banks.
N20 1020  7       The jetting, frothing surface of the river reached
N20 1030  4    the level of the runoff. The dangerous current upon
N20 1040  1    the prairie ceased, but the water stood and kept on
N20 1040 11    rising. They cringed under sodden covers, listening
N20 1050  5    to the waves slop against the bottom.
N20 1060  1       The cloudburst cut off abruptly. They were engulfed
N20 1060  9    by the weird silence, broken only by the low, angry
N20 1070 10    murmur of the river. Then the darkness thinned, and
N20 1080  6    there was light again, and then bright sunlight.
N20 1090  2       Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill, they
N20 1100  1    crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly
N20 1100 10    at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding
N20 1110  7    hills. The water level was higher than their hubs.
N20 1120  5    Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored.
N20 1130  1       There was no real sign of the river now, just a
N20 1130 12    roiling, oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy
N20 1140  8    waters that reached everywhere. Clumps of brush rode
N20 1150  5    down the ribbon. Now and then, the glistening side
N20 1160  2    of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past.
N20 1170  1       The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of
N20 1170 10    the sunshine, hugging her shoulders and still trembling.
N20 1180  6    Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered
N20 1190  5    with blame for Ben.
N20 1190  9       Out of compulsion to say something cheery, Ben Prime
N20 1200  7    blurted, "Well, we were lucky to be on soft ground
N20 1210  6    when the first floodheads hit. At least, the wheels
N20 1220  1    dug in. The soaking will put life back in the wagon,
N20 1220 12    too".
N20 1230  1       His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard. She was
N20 1230 11    watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current.
N20 1240  8    Somebody was riding the tree. It raced closer and they
N20 1250  7    could see a woman with white hair, sitting astride
N20 1260  2    an upright branch.
N20 1260  5       She did not call out. But as the tree passed, she
N20 1270  5    lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell.
N20 1280  1    They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a
N20 1280 11    bend. It speared up into the air, then sinking back,
N20 1290  8    the up-jutting branch turned slowly. The pale blob
N20 1300  5    of the woman disappeared.
N20 1300  9       "There's the one who's lucky"! the girl murmured
N20 1310  8    harshly.
N20 1310  9       Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt, his homely
N20 1320  9    face slashed with gray and crimson. Then he took off
N20 1330  7    his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk
N20 1340  5    with the beasts, needing their comfort more than they
N20 1350  1    needed his.
N20 1350  3       It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of
N20 1360  1    the wagon, half-swimming his way, for he was not a
N20 1360 12    tall man. He let down the tailgate and was knocked
N20 1370  7    over by the sluice of water.
N20 1380  1       He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly
N20 1380  9    to pull his bags of seed grain forward. They were already
N20 1390  7    swollen to bursting. Of all their worldly belongings,
N20 1400  2    next to the oxen and his gun, the seed grain had been
N20 1410  1    the most treasured. It was spoiled now for seed, and
N20 1410 11    it would sour and mold in three days if they failed
N20 1420  9    to find a place and fuel to dry it. The oxen might
N20 1430  5    as well enjoy it.
N20 1430  9       He examined the water marks on the iron tires when
N20 1440  6    the animals were finished. The waters lay muddy but
N20 1450  3    placid, without a ripple of movement against the wheels;
N20 1450 12    there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they
N20 1460 12    were receding.
N20 1470  1       He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate,
N20 1470 13    dry hills that rimmed the valley. A terrible, numbing
N20 1480  8    sense of futility swept over him.
N20 1490  3       He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency
N20 1490 12    of defeat. Then he noticed that the dry wood of the
N20 1500 11    wheels had swollen. The spokes were tight again, the
N20 1510  7    iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece.
N20 1520  6       Hope surged within him. He swung toward the front
N20 1540  1    to give the news to Hettie, then stopped, barred from
N20 1540 11    her by the vehemence of her blame and hate. Still,
N20 1550  9    he felt better. A tight wagon meant so much.
N20 1560  5    ##
N20 1560  6    He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee.
N20 1570  3    He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour,
N20 1580  1    salvaging the chunky, watery messes for biscuits of
N20 1580  9    a sort. Their jams and jellies had not suffered. He
N20 1590  8    found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that
N20 1600  6    they had meant to save. Now he broke them open, hoping
N20 1610  2    a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie.
N20 1620  1       His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling
N20 1620 10    bacon and heating java, but the fire was low, and he
N20 1630  9    wanted to waste no time. He furled the slashed sides
N20 1640  5    of the canvas tarpaulins, leaving the ribs and wagon
N20 1650  2    open.
N20 1650  3       He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk, holding
N20 1660  1    her meager treasures. He said hesitantly, "Hettie,
N20 1660  8    I don't figure your things got wet too much. That's
N20 1670  9    a good trunk. If you want to get them aired ..."
N20 1680  7       She said without turning her head, "After that rain
N20 1690  4    beating in atop the dust, there isn't a thing that
N20 1700  2    won't be streaked".
N20 1700  5       He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung
N20 1710  5    out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs.
