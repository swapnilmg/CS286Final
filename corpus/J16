J16 0010  1    _PURIFICATION OF THE CONJUGATES_
J16 0010  5       In attempting to improve specificity of staining,
J16 0020  3    the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct
J16 0030  1    and indirect methods were treated in one of several
J16 0030 10    ways: (1) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride
J16 0040  7    twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders (Coons,
J16 0050  4    1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet
J16 0060  2    clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium
J16 0070  1    tumefaciens (E. F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet
J16 0070 10    clover stems. (2) The conjugates as well as the intermediate
J16 0090  9    sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20-50 mg of
J16 0100  9    proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems.
J16 0110  3    The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of **f in
J16 0120  1    **f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated
J16 0120 10    by 80% saturation with **f. The precipitate was washed
J16 0130  7    twice with an 80% saturated solution of **f, dissolved
J16 0140  5    in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer,
J16 0150  3    dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from
J16 0160  2    ammonium ions, and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen.
J16 0160  9    (3) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was
J16 0170  6    treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended
J16 0180  5    by Dineen and Ade (1957). (4) The conjugates were passed
J16 0190  3    through a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE-) cellulose column
J16 0200  2    equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer (PBS) containing
J16 0210  1    **f potassium phosphate and **f.
J16 0220  1    _PREPARATION OF FROZEN SECTIONS_
J16 0220  1       The technique of cutting sections was essentially
J16 0220  8    the same as that described by Coons et al. (1951).
J16 0230  7    Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected
J16 0250  5    with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded
J16 0260  3    in ice, and cut at 3-6 |m in a cryostat maintained
J16 0270  1    at -16` to -20`. The sections were mounted on cold
J16 0270 13    slides smeared with Haupts' adhesive (Johansen, 1940)
J16 0280  7    in earlier experiments, and in later experiments with
J16 0290  6    a different mixture of the same components reported
J16 0300  2    by Schramm and Ro^ttger (1959). The latter adhesive
J16 0310  1    was found to be much more satisfactory. The sections
J16 0310 10    were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide
J16 0320  9    and dried under a fan for 30 minutes; until used they
J16 0330  6    were stored for as long as 2 weeks.
J16 0340  1    _STAINING TECHNIQUE_
J16 0340  2       _INDIRECT METHOD._
J16 0340  4       The sections were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes
J16 0360  5    and dried at 37` for 30 minutes. Some of them were
J16 0370  2    then covered with a drop of **f in a moist chamber
J16 0370 13    at 24` for 30-40 minutes. As controls other sections
J16 0380  8    were similarly covered with NS. Sections were then
J16 0390  5    washed with PBS for 15-30 minutes. After blotting
J16 0400  3    out most of the saline around the sections, a drop
J16 0410  1    of **f was layered over each of the sections, allowed
J16 0410 11    to react for 30 minutes, and then washed with PBS
J16 0420  7    for 15-30 minutes. After blotting out most of the liquid
J16 0430  6    around the sections, the latter were mounted in buffered
J16 0440  3    glycerine (7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS).
J16 0450  1    _DIRECT METHOD._
J16 0450  3       After drying the sections under the fan, fixing
J16 0460  1    in acetone, and drying at 37` as in the indirect method,
J16 0460 12    the sections were treated with conjugated **f or **f
J16 0470  8    (undiluted unless mentioned otherwise) for 5-30 minutes.
J16 0480  6    As controls, other sections were similarly treated
J16 0490  2    with **f or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain
J16 0490 12    of potato yellow-dwarf virus (Wolcyrz and Black, 1956).
J16 0500  9    The sections were then washed with PBS for 15-30 minutes
J16 0510 10    and mounted in buffered glycerine.
J16 0520  2    _FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY_
J16 0520  4       Stained or unstained sections were examined under
J16 0530  4    dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope
J16 0540  2    equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (Osram HBO 200).
J16 0550  2    The light beam from the lamp was filtered through a
J16 0550 12    half-standard thickness Corning 1840 filter. In the
J16 0560  7    eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off
J16 0570  7    residual ultra-violet light. A red filter, Zeiss barrier
J16 0580  3    filter with the code (Schott) designation BG 23, was
J16 0590  3    also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved
J16 0590 13    the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence.
J16 0600  6    #RESULTS#
J16 0610  1    _SPECIFICITY OF STAINING_
J16 0610  3       _INDIRECT METHOD._
J16 0610  5       In the first few experiments **f was passed through
J16 0620  5    Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50-100
J16 0630  5    mg sweet clover tissue powder. The intermediate sera
J16 0640  2    were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder. Sections
J16 0640 10    of sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with
J16 0650  9    1:10 solution of **f for 30 minutes, washed in buffered
J16 0660  7    saline for 15 minutes, stained with **f for 30 minutes,
J16 0670  5    and washed for 15 minutes in PBS. Such sections showed
J16 0680  2    bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells
J16 0690  1    of the pseudophloem tissue (Lee and Black, 1955). This
J16 0690 10    specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from
J16 0700  5    the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive
J16 0710  3    sections stained with 1:10 dilution of NS and **f
J16 0720  3    or with **f alone. Unstained sections mounted in buffered
J16 0730  1    glycerine or sections treated only with NS or **f
J16 0730 10    did not show such green fluorescence. Sections of crown
J16 0740  7    gall tissue similarly stained with either **f and **f
J16 0750  6    or NS and **f also showed only the light green nonspecific
J16 0760  3    fluorescence. However, the nonspecific staining by
J16 0770  2    the **f in tumor sections was considered bright enough
J16 0770 11    to be confused with the staining of small amounts of
J16 0780  8    WTV antigen.
J16 0790  1       Two absorptions of **f with ethyl acetate or two
J16 0790 10    absorptions of **f (which had been passed through
J16 0800  5    Dowex-2-chloride),
J16 0800  8    NS and **f with crown gall tissue powder, or mouse
J16 0810  7    liver powder did not further improve the specificity
J16 0820  3    of staining. Treatment of all the sera with sweet clover
J16 0830  2    proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence,
J16 0830  7    especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to
J16 0840  7    1:2 with 0.85% saline. In all the above procedures,
J16 0850  5    when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1:10 or
J16 0860  3    1:100 with 0.85% saline, the specific and nonspecific
J16 0860 11    fluorescence were not appreciably reduced, whereas,
J16 0870  6    a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1:500 or diluting
J16 0880  6    the **f to 1:5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence.
J16 0890  3    Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the
J16 0910  2    intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction.
J16 0910 10    In addition to other treatments, treating the sections
J16 0920  7    with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering
J16 0930  7    **f did not reduce nonspecific staining.
J16 0940  1       The only treatment by which nonspecific staining
J16 0940  8    could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the
J16 0950  6    conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column. When 1
J16 0960  4    ml of conjugate was passed through a column (**f),
J16 0980  2    the first and second milliliter fractions collected
J16 0980  9    were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining
J16 0990  7    in some experiments, and very little in others. In
J16 1000  6    the latter cases an additional treatment of the
J16 1010  2    DEAE-cellulose-treated
J16 1010  5    **f with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder
J16 1020  3    further improved the specificity. After these treatments
J16 1030  1    the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet
J16 1030 11    clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which
J16 1040  9    was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green
J16 1050  6    specific staining. With this purified conjugate the
J16 1060  3    best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections
J16 1070  1    with 1:10 dilution of **f for 30 minutes, washing with
J16 1070 11    PBS for 15 minutes, staining with **f for 30 minutes,
J16 1080 10    and washing with PBS for 15 minutes. The specificity
J16 1090  7    of staining in WTV tumors with **f and **f but not
J16 1100  7    with NS and **f or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf
J16 1110  4    virus and **f, and the absence of such staining in
J16 1120  2    crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate
J16 1120 10    that an antigen of WTV was being stained.
J16 1130  6    _DIRECT METHOD._
J16 1130  8       **f was first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per
J16 1140  7    gram of globulin. This conjugate was passed twice through
J16 1150  5    Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders
J16 1160  3    in the same manner as described for the indirect method.
J16 1170  1    In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining
J16 1170 10    was still present although it was still distinguishable
J16 1180  7    from specific fluorescence.
J16 1190  1       In later experiments, **f and **f were prepared
J16 1190  9    by conjugating 8 mg of FITC per gram of globulin.
J16 1200  9    These conjugates **f had much less nonspecific staining
J16 1210  7    than the previous conjugate (with 50 mg FITC per
J16 1220  5    gram of globulin) while the specific staining was similar
J16 1230  3    in both cases. Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily
J16 1240  1    eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose
J16 1250  1    column as described for **f. The best staining procedure
J16 1250 10    with this purified **f consisted of staining with the
J16 1260  9    conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15
J16 1270  8    minutes. The specificity of staining with **f was established
J16 1280  6    as follows: **f specifically stained tumor sections
J16 1290  3    but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of
J16 1300  2    crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover. Sections
J16 1300 10    of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained
J16 1310  7    with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum
J16 1320  4    to potato yellow-dwarf virus.
J16 1320  9       After passing **f through DEAE-cellulose, the titer
J16 1340  8    of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was
J16 1350  7    1:4 of the titer before such passage (precipitin ring
J16 1360  4    tests by R. F. Whitcomb); but mere dilution of the
J16 1370  3    conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific
J16 1380  1    staining. This indicates that increase in specificity
J16 1380  8    of **f after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was
J16 1390  7    not merely due to dilution.
J16 1400  1       Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated **f
J16 1410  1    and **f, although clearly distinguishable under the
J16 1410  8    microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence
J16 1420  5    of cells, was not satisfactorily photographed to show
J16 1430  4    such differences in spite of many attempts with black
J16 1440  3    and white and color photography. This was chiefly because
J16 1450  1    of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells.
J16 1450  9    The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells
J16 1460  8    was particularly brilliant.
J16 1470  1    _DISTRIBUTION OF VIRUS ANTIGEN_
J16 1470  5       Results of specific staining by the direct and the
J16 1480  4    indirect methods were similar and showed the localization
J16 1490  1    of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors. The virus
J16 1490 11    antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue.
J16 1500  7    Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or, rarely,
J16 1510  6    groups of such cells in the xylem region, were also
J16 1520  3    specifically stained, but there was no such staining
J16 1530  1    in epidermis, cortex, most xylem cells, ray cells,
J16 1530  9    or pith.
J16 1530 11       Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of
J16 1540  7    WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm. No antigen
J16 1550  7    was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most
J16 1560  5    cells. These areas are thought to represent the nuclei.
J16 1570  2    In some tumor sections small spherical bodies, possibly
J16 1570 10    inclusion bodies (Littau and Black, 1952) stained more
J16 1580  8    intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained
J16 1590  8    more antigen. In all cases studied tissues of the stem
J16 1600  6    on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable
J16 1610  3    amounts of WTV antigen.
J16 1610  7    #DISCUSSION#
J16 1610  8    In both the direct and indirect methods of staining,
J16 1620  9    the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions.
J16 1630  4    In the indirect method, this was evident from the fact
J16 1640  5    that tumor sections were stained light green even when
J16 1650  3    stained with NS and **f or with **f only. In the direct
J16 1660  1    method, **f, not further treated, stained certain tissues
J16 1660  9    of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and WTV
J16 1670  7    tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable
J16 1680  4    **f. After **f and **f were passed through Dowex-2-chloride
J16 1690  4    twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue
J16 1700  2    powder, nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but
J16 1700  9    a disturbing amount of such staining was still present.
J16 1710  8    Treatment of the conjugates with ethyl acetate, and
J16 1720  5    the conjugates (which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride)
J16 1730  5    with mouse liver powder, sweet clover crown gall tissue
J16 1740  3    powder, or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily
J16 1750  1    remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates.
J16 1750  8    Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been
J16 1760  8    successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several
J16 1770  5    other systems (Coons, 1958). Schramm and Ro^ttger (1959)
J16 1790  4    did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant
J16 1810  3    tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum
J16 1810  9    to tobacco mosaic virus. The reason for the failure
J16 1820  8    of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining
J16 1830  4    in the conjugates in our system is not known.
J16 1840  2       In our work the best procedure for removing substances
J16 1850  1    causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific
J16 1850  9    conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose
J16 1860  1    column and in some cases to absorb the first and second
J16 1870  1    milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.
J16 1870  8       The specific staining by both direct and indirect
J16 1880  7    methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in
J16 1890  4    the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cells
J16 1900  2    in the xylem region, but was not detectable in any
J16 1900 12    other tissues of the root and stem tumors. A study
J16 1910 10    of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem
J16 1920  5    cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed
J16 1930  2    in the cytoplasm.
J16 1930  5       Wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus
J16 1940  3    not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation
J16 1970  1    (Black, 1944; Brakke et al., 1954). The concentration
J16 1971  1    and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem
J16 1980  9    tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially
J16 1990 10    multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly
J16 2000 10    placed in this tissue in order to infect plants.
