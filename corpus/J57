J57 0010  1    Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as
J57 0010 11    "a learned diversion of a learned world", "a phantasy
J57 0020  8    with which More amused himself", "a holiday work, a
J57 0030  6    spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits,
J57 0040  3    a revel of debate, paradox, comedy and invention".
J57 0040 11    With respect to this view, two points are worth making.
J57 0050 10    First, it appears to be based on the fact that on its
J57 0060 10    title page Utopia is described as "festivus", "gay".
J57 0070  4    It overlooks the other fact that it is described as
J57 0080  5    "Nec minus salutaris quam festivus", "no less salutary
J57 0090  3    than gay". It also overlooks the fact that in a rational
J57 0100  1    lexicon, and quite clearly in More's lexicon, the opposite
J57 0100 10    of serious is not gay but frivolous, and the opposite
J57 0110 10    of gay is not serious but solemn. More believed that
J57 0120  6    a man could be both serious and gay. That a writer
J57 0130  4    who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional
J57 0140  1    illusion, sedulously fostered by all too many academics
J57 0140  9    who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts
J57 0150  6    should be taken seriously because they are expressed
J57 0160  4    with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of
J57 0170  2    expression their authors are capable of. Secondly,
J57 0170  9    to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in
J57 0180  7    More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth
J57 0190  5    century wars, of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed,
J57 0200  3    of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful
J57 0210  1    requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that
J57 0210  9    would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising
J57 0220  8    in More himself. Indeed, it is even surprising in the
J57 0230  7    Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical
J57 0240  4    History, who fathered this most peculiar view, and
J57 0250  3    in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance
J57 0260  1    English at Cambridge, who inherited it and is now its
J57 0260 11    most eminent proponent.
J57 0270  2       But to return to the main line of our inquiry. It
J57 0280  1    is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because
J57 0280 10    More was medieval or even because he was a martyr-
J57 0290  8    indeed, it is likely that these days many who read
J57 0300  5    Utopia with interest do not even know that its author
J57 0310  3    was a martyr. Utopia is still widely read because in
J57 0320  1    a sense More stood on the margin of modernity. And
J57 0320 11    if he did stand on the margins of modernity, it was
J57 0330  8    not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy
J57 0340  4    might be able to force on Western Christendom. It was
J57 0350  3    not even in writing Latin epigrams, sometimes bawdy
J57 0350 11    ones, or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin
J57 0360  8    or in defending the study of Greek against the attack
J57 0370  6    of conservative academics, or in attacking the conservative
J57 0380  3    theologians who opposed Erasmus's philological study
J57 0390  2    of the New Testament. Similar literary exercises were
J57 0390 10    the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first
J57 0400 10    two decades of the sixteenth century. Had More's writings
J57 0410  6    been wholly limited to such exercises, they would be
J57 0420  5    almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so
J57 0430  3    other authors living in his time, whose works tenuously
J57 0430 12    survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who
J57 0440 10    each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions
J57 0450  6    read those works.
J57 0450  9       More stands on the margins of modernity for one
J57 0460  9    reason alone- because he wrote Utopia. And the evidence
J57 0470  6    that he does, indeed, stand there derives quite simply
J57 0480  4    from the vigorous interest with which rather casual
J57 0490  1    readers have responded to that book for the past century
J57 0490 11    or so. Only one other contemporary of More's evokes
J57 0500  8    so immediate and direct a response, and only one other
J57 0510  7    contemporary work- Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince.
J57 0520  4    Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked
J57 0530  4    this response? Remember that in seeking the modern
J57 0540  1    in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval
J57 0540 12    and the Renaissance there; we do not even need to commit
J57 0550  9    ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale
J57 0570  2    the relative importance of the medieval, the Renaissance,
J57 0580  2    and the modern. The medieval was the most important
J57 0590  1    to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More,
J57 0590 10    the author of Utopia, in some intelligible relation
J57 0600  6    with St. Thomas More, the martyr. To others whose concern
J57 0610  7    it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism,
J57 0620  4    the Renaissance elements are of primary concern. But
J57 0630  3    here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we
J57 0630 11    want to know why that book has kept on selling the
J57 0640 11    way it has; we want to know what is perennially new
J57 0650  7    about Utopia.
J57 0650  9       What is new about it? To that question the answer
J57 0660  8    is simple; it can be made in two words, Utopian communism.
J57 0670  6    But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an
J57 0680  5    onrush of objections and denials. Surely there is nothing
J57 0690  1    new about communism. We find it in Plato's republic,
J57 0690 10    and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book.
J57 0700 10    We find it in that "common way of life ... pleasing
J57 0710  9    to Christ and ... still in use among the truest societies
J57 0720  6    of Christians", that is, the better monasteries which
J57 0730  3    made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity.
J57 0750  1    We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural
J57 0750 12    condition which included the community of all possessions.
J57 0760  8    This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers
J57 0770  9    and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle
J57 0780  5    Ages; and More was far too well read not to have come
J57 0790  4    across it in one or several of the forms thus given
J57 0790 15    it.
J57 0800  1       But although the idea of communism is very old even
J57 0800 11    in More's day and did not spring full-clad from his
J57 0810 10    imagination in 1515, it is not communism as such that
J57 0820  7    we are concerned with. We are concerned not with the
J57 0830  4    genus communism nor with other species of the genus:
J57 0840  1    Platonic, Stoic, early Christian, monastic, canonist
J57 0840  7    or theological communism; we are concerned with Utopian
J57 0850  7    communism- that is, simply communism as it appears
J57 0860  5    in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia, as More conceived
J57 0870  4    it. Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity
J57 0880  1    of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal
J57 0880 11    earlier types of communistic theory. We will achieve
J57 0890  8    a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what
J57 0900  8    it is not.
J57 0900 11       In Plato's Republic communism is- to speak anachronistically-
J57 0910  6    a communism of Janissaries. Its function is to separate
J57 0920  6    from the base ruled mass, among whom private ownership
J57 0930  4    prevails, the governing warrior elite. Moreover, it
J57 0940  2    is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what
J57 0941  1    gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the
J57 0950  9    construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its
J57 0960  5    ruling-class communism of goods, wives, and children,
J57 0970  3    was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of
J57 0980  1    the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem
J57 0980 11    that the Republic ultimately returns. In More's Utopia
J57 0990  6    communism is not a means of separating out a warrior
J57 1000  8    elite from the lumpish mass. Utopian communism applies
J57 1010  3    to all Utopians. And in the economy of the book it
J57 1020  3    is not peripheral but central. The concern of Utopia
J57 1020 12    is with the optimo reipublicae statu, the best ordering
J57 1030  9    of a civil society; and it is again and again made
J57 1040  8    clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional
J57 1050  4    array indispensible to that best ordering.
J57 1060  1       To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian
J57 1060  9    community of the apostolic age or from its medieval
J57 1070  9    successors-in-spirit, the monastic communities, is
J57 1080  5    with an appropriate shift of adjectives, misleading
J57 1090  2    in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic:
J57 1100  1    in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical
J57 1110  1    and intellectual athletes, in the apostolic and monastic
J57 1110  9    communities with an elite of spiritual and religious
J57 1120  7    athletes. The apostolic community was literally an
J57 1130  4    elite: chosen by Christ himself. And the monastic communities
J57 1140  2    were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected
J57 1140 11    only after a novitiate which would test their religious
J57 1150  9    aptitude for monastic rigors, their spiritual athleticism.
J57 1160  5       Finally, the conception of the natural community
J57 1170  5    of all possessions which originated with the Stoics
J57 1180  4    was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time, although
J57 1190  1    it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers
J57 1190 10    of the Middle Ages. In that tradition communism lay
J57 1200  8    a safe distance back in the age of innocence before
J57 1210  6    the Fall of Man. It did not serve to contrast the existing
J57 1220  4    order of society with a possible alternative order,
J57 1230  1    because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative
J57 1230 11    once man had sinned. The actual function of
J57 1240  7    patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic
J57 1250  1    communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost
J57 1250 10    a millenium before More wrote Utopia.
J57 1260  6       "The soil is common to all men ... When we give
J57 1270  8    the necessities of life to the poor, we restore to
J57 1280  4    them what is already theirs. We should think of it
J57 1280 14    more as an act of justice than compassion".
J57 1290  8       Because community not severalty of property is the
J57 1300  6    law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable
J57 1310  2    right to what is his. Indeed, of all that is his every
J57 1320  1    man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience
J57 1320 11    obligated to regard himself as a custodian. He is a
J57 1330 10    trustee for the common good, however feeble the safeguards
J57 1340  5    which the positive or municipal law of property provides
J57 1350  3    against his misuse of that share of the common fund,
J57 1360  1    wisely or unwisely, entrusted to his keeping. In contrast
J57 1360 10    to this Stoic-patristic view, Utopia implies that the
J57 1370  8    nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience
J57 1380  7    to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark
J57 1390  6    on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve.
J57 1400  4    The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions.
J57 1400 11    In a properly ordered society the massive force of
J57 1410  9    public law performs the function which in natural law
J57 1420  6    theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice
J57 1430  4    so often still.
J57 1430  7       In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism
J57 1450  3    differs from previous conceptions in which community
J57 1460  1    of possessions and living plays a role. Neither from
J57 1460 10    one of these conceptions nor from a combination of
J57 1470  7    them can it be deduced. We do not deny originality
J57 1480  4    to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales
J57 1490  2    of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks.
J57 1490 14    In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous
J57 1500 10    conceptions one may find in it, Utopian communism remains,
J57 1510  7    as an integral whole, original- a new thing. It is
J57 1520  8    not merely a new thing; it is one of the very few new
J57 1530  3    things in Utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist
J57 1540  1    or part of an old tradition of social criticism. But
J57 1540 11    to say that at a moment in history something is new
J57 1550  9    is not necessarily to say that it is modern; and for
J57 1560  7    this statement the best evidence comes within the five
J57 1570  4    years following the publication of Utopia, when Martin
J57 1580  2    Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of
J57 1580 11    the Divine's encounter with man. New, indeed, is Luther's
J57 1590  8    perception, but not modern, as anyone knows who has
J57 1600  8    ever tried to make intelligible to modern students
J57 1610  4    what Luther was getting at.
J57 1610  9       Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and
J57 1620  8    also modern, it is not modern communism or even modern
J57 1630  4    socialism, as they exist or have ever existed in theory
J57 1640  2    or in practice. Consider the features of Utopian communism:
J57 1650  1    generous public provision for the infirm; democratic
J57 1650  8    and secret elections of all officers including priests,
J57 1660  6    meals taken publicly in common refectories; a common
J57 1670  4    habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens; even
J57 1680  2    houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor
J57 1690  1    a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars,
J57 1690 12    and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking;
J57 1700  6    no private property, no money; no sort of pricing at
J57 1710  6    all for any goods or services, and therefore no market
J57 1720  3    in the economic sense of the term. Whatever the merits
J57 1720 13    of its intent, Utopian communism is far too naive,
J57 1730  9    far too crude, to suit any modern socialist or communist.
J57 1740  6    It is not the details of Utopian communism that make
J57 1750  4    Utopia modern, it is the spirit, the attitude of mind
J57 1760  3    that informs those details. What that spirit and attitude
J57 1770  1    were we can best understand if we see more precisely
J57 1770 11    how it contrasts with the communist tradition with
J57 1780  6    the longest continuous history, the one which reached
J57 1790  4    Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church
J57 1800  2    Fathers of Late Antiquity.
