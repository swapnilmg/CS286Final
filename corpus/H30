H30 0010  1    Between meetings he helps the president keep track
H30 0010  9    of delegated matters. Since these duties fit neatly
H30 0020  6    with those of the proposed presidential aide, one person,
H30 0030  4    with adequate staff assistance, could fill both jobs.
H30 0040  2    ##
H30 0040  3    Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals
H30 0050  1    rather than as employees, enthusiasm in a common enterprise
H30 0050 10    is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have
H30 0060  9    in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern
H30 0070  6    its course.
H30 0070  8       The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary
H30 0080  7    to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship.
H30 0090  3    The president expects faculty members to remember,
H30 0100  1    in exercising their autonomy, that they share no collective
H30 0100 10    responsibility for the university's income nor are
H30 0110  7    they personally accountable for top-level decisions.
H30 0120  5    He may welcome their appropriate participation in the
H30 0130  3    determination of high policy, but he has a right to
H30 0140  1    expect, in return, that they will leave administrative
H30 0140  9    matters to the administration.
H30 0150  2       How well do faculty members govern themselves? There
H30 0160  2    is little evidence that they are giving any systematic
H30 0160 11    thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and
H30 0170 10    nature of their part in government. They sometimes
H30 0180  4    pay more attention to their rights than to their own
H30 0190  4    internal problems of government. They, too, need to
H30 0190 12    learn to delegate. Letting the administration take
H30 0200  7    details off their hands would give them more time to
H30 0210  7    inform themselves about education as a whole, an area
H30 0220  4    that would benefit by more faculty attention.
H30 0220 11       Although faculties insist on governing themselves,
H30 0230  6    they grant little prestige to a member who actively
H30 0240  6    participates in college or university government. There
H30 0250  3    are, nevertheless, several things that the president
H30 0260  1    can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the
H30 0260 10    prestige of those who are willing to exercise their
H30 0270  7    privilege. He can, for example, present significant
H30 0280  3    university-wide issues to the senate. He can encourage
H30 0290  1    quality in faculty committee work in various ways:
H30 0290  9    by seeing to it that the membership of each committee
H30 0300  8    represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented
H30 0310  6    faculty; by making certain that no faculty member has
H30 0320  3    too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison
H30 0330  1    between the committees and the administration; by minimizing
H30 0330  9    the number of committees.
H30 0340  4       Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas
H30 0350  3    between faculty and administration, complaints of a
H30 0350 10    lack of communication persist. The cause is as often
H30 0360  9    neglect as hesitance to disclose. A busy president,
H30 0370  6    conversant with a problem and its ramifications and
H30 0380  2    beset by pressures to meet deadlines, tends naturally
H30 0380 10    to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem
H30 0390 11    as he is. The need for interchange and understanding
H30 0400  6    makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation.
H30 0410  4       To increase faculty influence and decrease tension,
H30 0420  2    many presidents have established a standing advisory
H30 0430  1    committee with which they can discuss problems frankly.
H30 0430  9       The president has little influence in day-by-day
H30 0440  8    curricular changes, but if he looks ahead two, three,
H30 0450  6    or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging
H30 0460  3    ideas, he can open the way for innovation, and he can
H30 0470  1    also have a great deal to say as to what path it will
H30 0470 14    take. Success will require tact, sensitivity to faculty
H30 0480  7    prerogatives, patience, and persistence.
H30 0500  2    ##
H30 0500  3    The critical task for every president and his academic
H30 0510  2    administrative staff is to assure that the college
H30 0510 10    or university continually rebuilds and regenerates
H30 0520  5    itself so that its performance will match changing
H30 0530  4    social demands ... great professors do not automatically
H30 0540  1    reproduce themselves.
H30 0540  3       Deans can form an important bridge between the president
H30 0550  4    and the faculty. They serve not only as spokesmen for
H30 0560  2    their areas, but they also contribute to top-level
H30 0560 11    decision making. The president who appoints strong
H30 0570  7    men who have an all-college or university point of
H30 0580  5    view and a talent and respect for administration can
H30 0590  2    count on useful assistance.
H30 0590  6       Faculty members depend on their department chairmen
H30 0600  4    to promote their interests with the administration.
H30 0610  1    The administration at the same time, looks to the chairmen
H30 0620  1    for strategic aid in building stronger departments.
H30 0620  8    One way that this can be done, other than by hiring
H30 0630  8    new high-priced professors, is by constantly encouraging
H30 0640  2    the department members to raise their standards of
H30 0650  2    performance.
H30 0650  3       The quality of a president's leadership is measured
H30 0660  2    first by his success in building up the faculty. By
H30 0660 12    supporting the efforts of the many faculty members
H30 0670  8    who are working to attain ever higher standards, the
H30 0680  4    president can encourage faculty leadership. Indirectly
H30 0690  2    he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria
H30 0690 12    for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth
H30 0700  8    and adhered to.
H30 0710  1       The academic dean should take a direct, long-term
H30 0710 10    interest in faculty development. An alert dean will
H30 0720  6    confer all through the year on personnel needs, plans
H30 0730  3    for the future, qualifications of those on the job,
H30 0740  1    and bright prospects elsewhere.
H30 0740  5       For the maintenance of a long-term program, the
H30 0750  3    departments, and particularly their chairmen, are strategic.
H30 0760  2    They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment
H30 0760  9    and promotion. To provide an independent judgment for
H30 0770  8    the president, the academic dean also investigates
H30 0780  5    candidates thoroughly.
H30 0780  7       At some colleges and universities, a faculty committee
H30 0790  7    reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications
H30 0800  7    of candidates. Some faculty members and many administrators
H30 0810  5    oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat
H30 0820  4    department's actions or act pro forma. They can be
H30 0830  3    effective, however, if their members set high standards
H30 0830 11    for candidates and devote substantial time to the work.
H30 0840  8    At one university, the president cites the faculty
H30 0850  6    review committee as "a valued partner of the administration
H30 0860  4    in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty".
H30 0870  2       Before the president recommends a candidate to the
H30 0880  1    trustees, the administration collects the views of
H30 0880  8    colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus
H30 0890  7    and elsewhere. The president or dean reads some of
H30 0900  4    his publications to form the truest possible evaluation
H30 0910  1    of the quality of his mind. No good way to evaluate
H30 0910 12    teaching ability has yet been discovered, although
H30 0920  6    some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of
H30 0930  5    criteria. To avoid passing over quiet, unaggressive
H30 0940  1    teachers as well as to decide whether others merit
H30 0940 10    promotion, review of the right of faculty members to
H30 0950  8    promotion or salary increases should be made periodically
H30 0960  4    whether or not they have been recommended for advancement
H30 0970  2    by their departments.
H30 0970  5       There are certain aspects of personnel development
H30 0980  3    in which a president must involve himself directly.
H30 0990  1    He should personally consider the potential of a faculty
H30 0990 10    member proposed for tenure, to guard against the mistake
H30 1000  9    of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely
H30 1010  5    upon the man's former achievements. No one can be as
H30 1020  6    effective as the president in inspiring older men to
H30 1030  3    welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or
H30 1030 10    approach to their specialties is quite different. In
H30 1040  7    particular, the president may have to summon all his
H30 1050  7    oratorical powers to persuade department members to
H30 1060  2    accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale.
H30 1060 11    On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure
H30 1070 10    is not meeting the standards of the institution, the
H30 1080  6    president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision
H30 1090  4    and action.
H30 1090  6    ##
H30 1090  7    A true university, like most successful marriages,
H30 1100  3    is a unity of diversities ... Without forcing all components
H30 1110  3    into a single pattern, the preparation of a master
H30 1110 12    plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of
H30 1120  8    knowledge at its highest level, which a university-
H30 1130  5    in contrast to a multiversity- should stand for.
H30 1140  3       Recently colleges and universities have begun to
H30 1150  2    translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide
H30 1150  9    goals. Each year a few more institutions are deciding
H30 1160  9    such questions as: Shall we require a liberal education
H30 1170  7    built around a humanities core for all undergraduates?
H30 1180  4    Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific
H30 1190  2    and technological subjects? In the first instance,
H30 1190  9    adequate appropriate reading materials and library
H30 1200  6    accommodations must be planned. In the second, more
H30 1210  6    shops, laboratories, and staff will be required.
H30 1220  1       For the president, a master plan looking ahead five
H30 1220 10    years (the maximum reach for sound forecasting), offers
H30 1230  8    several practical advantages. Trustees, faculty, and
H30 1240  5    administration can consider the consequences of decisions
H30 1250  4    before they are made, instead of afterwards. Physical
H30 1260  2    plant and equipment can be efficiently developed. Proposed
H30 1270  1    new programs can be examined for appropriateness to
H30 1270  9    goals and for present and future financial fitness.
H30 1280  5    More than one president has found that a long-range
H30 1290  5    plan helps him to attract major gifts. It inspires
H30 1300  1    confidence in his institution's determination to establish
H30 1300  8    goals and to achieve them.
H30 1310  4       Before deciding where it is going, however, a college
H30 1320  1    or university must know where it is. The first step
H30 1320 11    is a comprehensive self study made by faculty, by outside
H30 1330  8    consultants, or by a combination of the two. It should
H30 1340  6    sternly appraise curricula, faculty, organization,
H30 1350  1    buildings, faculty work loads, and potential for growth
H30 1350  9    in stature and size.
H30 1360  4       Implementation of the master plan will inevitably
H30 1370  1    be uneven. Some departments will attack their new goals
H30 1370 10    enthusiastically; others may drag their feet. Funds
H30 1380  7    may be readily donated for some purposes but not others.
H30 1390  7    A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically,
H30 1400  5    possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning
H30 1410  2    officer.
H30 1410  3       To provide the continuous flow of information basic
H30 1420  2    to administrative decisions, a number of institutions
H30 1420  9    have established offices of institutional research.
H30 1430  5    Some offices have very broad responsibilities, touching
H30 1440  3    on almost all aspects of a university's instructional
H30 1450  2    program. Their duties include evaluation of the information
H30 1460  1    collected and preparation of recommendations. More
H30 1460  7    often, these offices are restricted to the gathering
H30 1470  7    of empirical data.
H30 1470 10    ##
H30 1470 11    ... the president's opportunity for influencing education
H30 1480  7    reaches its highest point, as he decides which projects
H30 1490  9    he will cut back, which he will advance by increased
H30 1500  6    allowances or new fund-raising efforts.
H30 1510  1       No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators,
H30 1510 11    budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of
H30 1520  9    dollars and cents. When the budget goes to trustees
H30 1530  6    for approval it is the president's budget, to which
H30 1540  3    his faith and credit are committed; its principal features
H30 1550  1    should be a product of his most considered judgment.
H30 1550 10    He cannot, of course, examine each proposal from scratch.
H30 1560  8    He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a
H30 1570  8    single joint product that will best promote the aims
H30 1580  3    of the institution.
H30 1580  6       Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to
H30 1590  4    the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship.
H30 1600  2    Because scientific instruction and research involve
H30 1600  8    increasingly large sums of money, an institution should
H30 1610  8    choose its fields of prominence. Otherwise it will
H30 1620  6    be headed for bankruptcy, at worst, and at best towards
H30 1630  5    starvation of other less dramatic but socially and
H30 1640  1    culturally indispensable branches of learning. In the
H30 1640  8    national interest even the affluent universities must
H30 1650  6    consider some division of labor among them to replace
H30 1660  5    their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses
H30 1670  1    in all branches.
H30 1670  4    ##
H30 1670  5    Supporting activities- business management, public
H30 1680  3    relations, fund-raising- offer presidents one of their
H30 1690  2    best chances to buy freedom for attention to education
H30 1690 11    ... Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of
H30 1700  8    administration can do much to free a president for
H30 1710  6    his primary role.
H30 1710  9       In the areas that do not relate directly to the
H30 1730  6    educational program, expert subordinates will serve
H30 1740  2    the college or university better than close presidential
H30 1740 10    attention. The president should find strong subordinates
H30 1750  7    and delegate the widest discretion to them. Higher
H30 1760  6    education cannot compete with the salary scales of
H30 1770  4    the business world, but an educational institution
H30 1770 11    can offer many potent intangible attractions to members
H30 1780  8    of the business community that will offset the differences
H30 1790  7    in income.
H30 1790  9       Just as the entire faculty should know the president's
H30 1800  8    educational philosophy and objectives, so should non-academic
H30 1810  7    officers. They will better understand the relationship
H30 1820  4    of their activities to the academic program and they
H30 1830  3    will be able to explain their actions to faculty in
H30 1830 13    terms of mutual goals.
H30 1840  3       A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic
H30 1850  3    civic and governmental capacities, to make speeches
H30 1850 10    to lay groups, and to make numerous ceremonial appearances
H30 1860  8    on and off campus. Since he can neither accept nor
H30 1870  7    reject them all, he must be governed by the time and
H30 1880  5    energy available for his prime professional obligations.
H30 1890  1    Declinations and substitutions are better received
H30 1890  7    when he explains why his obligations to his institution
H30 1900  7    preclude his acceptance.
H30 1910  1       By sharing the load of important speeches with his
H30 1910 10    colleagues, the president can develop a cadre of able
H30 1920  9    spokesmen who will help to create a public perception
H30 1930  5    of the university as an institution, something more
H30 1940  2    than the lengthened shadow of one man.
