K17 0010  1    Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black
K17 0010 10    rags carried on in a primitive way, almost unchanged
K17 0020  7    from feudal times. Peasants puzzled Andrei. He wondered
K17 0030  4    how they could go on in poverty, superstition, ignorance,
K17 0040  2    with a complete lack of desire to make either their
K17 0040 12    land or their lives flourish.
K17 0050  5       Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago. Tolek
K17 0060  4    Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine
K17 0070  1    and, before the national leadership, exalted the miracles
K17 0070  9    of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert. A fund-raising
K17 0080 10    drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched. Andrei
K17 0090  6    remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference.
K17 0100  6       Had he found the meaning too late? It aggravated
K17 0110  4    him. The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich, but no
K17 0120  3    one seemed to care. In the unfertile land in Palestine
K17 0120 13    humans broke their backs pushing will power to the
K17 0130  9    brink.
K17 0130 10       He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum
K17 0140  8    of a congress of Zionists. All of them were there in
K17 0150  7    this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies,
K17 0160  2    and each berated the other and beat his breast for
K17 0170  1    his own approaches. When Alexander Brandel rose to
K17 0170  9    speak, the hall became silent.
K17 0180  3       "I do not care if your beliefs take you along a
K17 0190  2    path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism.
K17 0190 15    We are here because all our paths travel a blind course
K17 0200 10    through a thick forest, seeking human dignity. Beyond
K17 0210  5    the forest all our paths merge into a single great
K17 0220  4    highway which ends in the barren, eroded hills of Judea.
K17 0230  1    This is our singular goal. How we travel through the
K17 0230 11    forest is for each man's conscience. Where we end our
K17 0240  8    journey is always the same. We all seek the same thing
K17 0250  7    through different ways- an end to this long night of
K17 0260  4    two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses
K17 0270  1    which will continue to plague us until the Star of
K17 0270 11    David flies over Zion". This was how Alexander Brandel
K17 0280  7    expressed pure Zionism. It had sounded good to Andrei,
K17 0290  7    but he did not believe it. In his heart he had no desire
K17 0300  6    to go to Palestine. He loathed the idea of drying up
K17 0310  3    swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural
K17 0310 14    birthright.
K17 0320  1       Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex,
K17 0320 10    "I only want to be a Pole. Warsaw is my city, not Tel
K17 0330 13    Aviv".
K17 0340  1       And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin
K17 0340 13    and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack
K17 0350 10    of belief. Warsaw! He saw the smug eyes of the Home
K17 0360  8    Army chief, Roman, and all the Romans and the faces
K17 0370  3    of the peasants who held only hatred for him. They
K17 0370 13    had let this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart
K17 0380  9    exist without a cry of protest.
K17 0390  2       Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys
K17 0400  1    bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted
K17 0400 10    from behind their fans.
K17 0410  2       Warsaw! Warsaw!
K17 0410  4       "Miss Rak. I am a Jew".
K17 0420  2       Day by day, week by week, month by month, the betrayal
K17 0430  1    gnawed at Andrei's heart. He ground his teeth together.
K17 0430 10    I hate Warsaw, he said to himself. I hate Poland and
K17 0440 10    all the goddamned mothers' sons of them. All of Poland
K17 0450  7    is a coffin.
K17 0450 10       The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded
K17 0460  7    his mind. What matters now? What is beyond this fog?
K17 0470  6    Only Palestine, and I will never live to see Palestine
K17 0480  3    because I did not believe.
K17 0480  8       By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling
K17 0490  7    yards in the railhead at Lublin, which was filled with
K17 0500  5    lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the
K17 0510  3    Russian front.
K17 0510  5       At a siding, another train which was a familiar
K17 0520  2    sight these days. Deportees. Jews. Andrei's skilled
K17 0520  9    eye sized them up. They were not Poles. He guessed
K17 0530 10    by their appearance that they were Rumanians.
K17 0540  5       He walked toward the center of the city to keep
K17 0550  4    his rendezvous with Styka. Of all the places in Poland,
K17 0560  1    Andrei hated Lublin the most. The Bathyrans were all
K17 0560 10    gone. Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin
K17 0570 10    were still in the ghetto.
K17 0580  1       From the moment of the occupation Lublin became
K17 0580  9    a focal point. He and Ana watched it carefully. Lublin
K17 0590  8    generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere.
K17 0600  6    Early in 1939, Odilo Globocnik, the Gauleiter of Vienna,
K17 0610  5    established SS headquarters for all of Poland. The
K17 0620  4    Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to
K17 0630  1    conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank
K17 0630 13    and the civilian administrators.
K17 0640  2       Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps. Lublin was
K17 0650  3    the seed of action for the "final solution" of the
K17 0650 13    Jewish problem. As the messages from Himmler, Heydrich,
K17 0660  8    and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk, Lublin's
K17 0670  7    fountainhead spouted.
K17 0680  1       A bevy of interlacing lagers, work camps, concentration
K17 0680  9    camps erupted in the area. Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners
K17 0690  8    of war disappeared into Lublin's web. Plans went in
K17 0700  7    and out of Lublin, indicating German confusion. A tale
K17 0710  5    of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several
K17 0720  3    million Jews ... A tale of a plan to ship all Jews
K17 0720 15    to the island of Madagascar ... Stories of the depravity
K17 0730 10    of the guards at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of
K17 0740  8    terror at the mere mention of their names. Lipowa 7,
K17 0750  6    Sobibor, Chelmno, Poltawa, Belzec, Krzywy-Rog, Budzyn,
K17 0760  2    Krasnik. Ice baths, electric shocks, lashings, wild
K17 0770  1    dogs, testicle crushers.
K17 0770  4       The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic
K17 0780  4    Auxiliaries, and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep
K17 0790  3    in blood and turned into drunken, dope-ridden maniacs.
K17 0800  1    Lublin was their heart.
K17 0800  5       In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in
K17 0810  3    Lublin. The ghetto, a miniature of Warsaw's, was emptied
K17 0820  1    into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called
K17 0820 10    Majdanek. As the camp emptied, it was refilled by a
K17 0830 10    draining of the camps and towns around Lublin, then
K17 0840  5    by deportees from outside Poland. In and in and in
K17 0850  4    they poured through the gates of Majdanek, but they
K17 0850 13    never left, and Majdanek was not growing any larger.
K17 0860  9       What was happening in Majdanek? Was Operation Reinhard
K17 0870  6    the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the
K17 0880  6    Umschlagplatz in Warsaw? Was there another Majdanek
K17 0890  3    in the Warsaw area, as they suspected?
K17 0890 10       Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around
K17 0900  8    quickly at the boundary of civil buildings. His watch
K17 0910  6    told him he was still early. Down the boulevard he
K17 0920  4    could see a portion of the ghetto wall. He found an
K17 0930  1    empty bench, opened a newspaper, and stretched his
K17 0930  9    legs before him. Krakow Boulevard was filled with black
K17 0940  7    Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their
K17 0950  5    Auxiliaries.
K17 0950  6       "Captain Androfski"!
K17 0960  1       Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and
K17 0960 11    looked into the mustached, homely face of Sergeant
K17 0970  6    Styka. Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly.
K17 0980  5    "I have been waiting across the street at the post
K17 0990  4    office since dawn. I thought you might get in on a
K17 0990 15    morning train".
K17 1000  2       "It's good to see you again, Styka".
K17 1010  1       Styka studied his captain. He almost broke into
K17 1010  9    tears. To him, Andrei Androfski had always been the
K17 1020  6    living symbol of a Polish officer. His captain was
K17 1030  4    thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn
K17 1040  1    and shabby.
K17 1040  3       "Remember to call me Jan", Andrei said.
K17 1050  1       Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously.
K17 1050 10    "When that woman found me and told me that you needed
K17 1060 11    me I was never so happy since before the war".
K17 1070  5       "I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin".
K17 1080  4       Styka grumbled about fate. "For a time I thought
K17 1090  3    of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces, but one
K17 1090 13    thing led to another. I got a girl in trouble and we
K17 1100 12    had to get married. Not a bad girl. So we have three
K17 1110  9    children and responsibilities. I work at the granary.
K17 1120  5    Nothing like the old days in the army, but I get by.
K17 1130  3    Who complains? Many times I tried to reach you, but
K17 1130 13    I never knew how. I came to Warsaw twice, but there
K17 1140 10    was that damned ghetto wall ..."
K17 1150  3       "I understand".
K17 1150  5       Styka blew his nose again.
K17 1160  2       "Were you able to make the arrangements"? Andrei
K17 1170  1    asked.
K17 1170  2       "There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman
K17 1170 12    in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek. I did exactly
K17 1180 10    as instructed. I told him you are on orders from the
K17 1190 10    Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a
K17 1200  6    report to the government in exile in London".
K17 1210  1       "His answer"?
K17 1210  3       "Ten thousand zlotys".
K17 1220  1       "Can he be trusted"?
K17 1220  5       "He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours
K17 1230  5    if he betrays you".
K17 1230  9       "Good man, Styka".
K17 1240  1       "Captain ... Jan ... must you go inside Majdanek?
K17 1250  1    The stories ... Everyone really knows what is happening
K17 1250 10    there".
K17 1260  1       "Not everyone, Styka".
K17 1260  4       "What good will it really do"?
K17 1270  2       "I don't know. Perhaps ... perhaps ... there is
K17 1280  2    a shred of conscience left in the human race. Perhaps
K17 1280 12    if they know the story there will be a massive cry
K17 1290  9    of indignation".
K17 1290 11       "Do you really believe that, Jan"?
K17 1300  6       "I have to believe it".
K17 1310  1       Styka shook his head slowly. "I am only a simple
K17 1310 11    soldier. I cannot think things out too well. Until
K17 1320  9    I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like
K17 1330  7    every other Pole in my feeling about Jews. I hated
K17 1340  4    you when I first came in. But ... my captain might
K17 1350  1    have been a Jew, but he wasn't a Jew. What I mean is,
K17 1350 14    he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys.
K17 1360  9    Hell, sir. The men of our company had a dozen fights
K17 1370  7    defending your name. You never knew about it, but by
K17 1380  4    God, we taught them respect for Captain Androfski".
K17 1390  1       Andrei smiled.
K17 1390  3       "Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have
K17 1400  4    behaved and I think, Holy Mother, we have behaved like
K17 1410  2    this for hundreds of years. Why"?
K17 1410  8       "How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind
K17 1420 10    man to see"?
K17 1420 13       "But we are neither blind nor insane. The men of
K17 1430 10    your company would not allow your name dishonored.
K17 1440  5    Why do we let the Germans do this"?
K17 1450  1       "I have sat many hours with this, Styka. All I ever
K17 1450 12    wanted was to be a free man in my own country. I've
K17 1460 12    lost faith, Styka. I used to love this country and
K17 1470  8    believe that someday we'd win our battle for equality.
K17 1480  4    But now I think I hate it very much".
K17 1490  1       "And do you really think that the world outside
K17 1490  9    Poland will care any more than we do"?
K17 1500  6       The question frightened Andrei.
K17 1510  1       "Please don't go inside Majdanek".
K17 1510  6       "I'm still a soldier in a very small way, Styka".
K17 1520  9       It was an answer that Styka understood.
K17 1530  3       Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the
K17 1540  3    River Bystrzyca near the rail center. Grabski sat in
K17 1540 12    a sweat-saturated undershirt, cursing the excessive
K17 1550  5    heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown.
K17 1560  4    He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face
K17 1570  4    and sunken Polish features. Flies swarmed around the
K17 1580  1    bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread.
K17 1580 11    Half of it dripped down his chin. He washed it down
K17 1590  8    with beer and produced a deep-seated belch.
K17 1600  2       "Well"? Andrei demanded.
K17 1600  5       Grabski looked at the pair of them. He grunted a
K17 1610 10    sort of "yes" answer. "My cousin works at the Labor
K17 1620  6    Bureau. He can make you work papers. It will take a
K17 1630  5    few days. I will get you inside the guard camp as a
K17 1640  1    member of my crew. I don't know if I can get you into
K17 1640 14    the inner camp. Maybe yes, maybe no, but you can observe
K17 1650  9    everything from the roof of a barrack we are building".
K17 1660  7       Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup
K17 1670  5    bowl. "Can't understand why the hell anyone wants to
K17 1680  3    go inside that son-of-a-bitch place".
K17 1680 11       "Orders from the Home Army".
K17 1690  4       "Why? Nothing there but Jews".
K17 1700  1       Andrei shrugged. "We get strange orders".
K17 1700  7       "Well- what about the money"?
K17 1710  7       Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes.
K17 1720  2    Grabski had never seen so much money. His broad flat
K17 1730  1    fingers, petrified into massive sausages by years of
K17 1730  9    bricklaying, snatched the bills clumsily. "This ain't
K17 1740  6    enough".
K17 1740  7       "You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek".
K17 1750 10       "I ain't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew
K17 1760  8    business".
K17 1760  9       Andrei and Styka were silent.
