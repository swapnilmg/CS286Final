G15 0010  1       It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis
G15 0010 11    of this story, because it brings together a number
G15 0020  7    of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious,
G15 0030  6    riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant
G15 0040  1    for Mann's work.
G15 0040  4       The wife, Amra, and her lover are both savagely
G15 0050  3    portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "voluptuous"
G15 0060  1    and "indolent", possibly "a mischief maker", with "a
G15 0060  9    kind of luxurious cunning" to set against her apparent
G15 0070  9    simplicity, her "birdlike brain". La^utner, for his
G15 0080  5    part, "belonged to the present-day race of small artists,
G15 0090  5    who do not demand the utmost of themselves", and the
G15 0100  3    bitter description of the type includes such epithets
G15 0110  1    as "wretched little poseurs", the devastating indictment
G15 0110  8    "they do not know how to be wretched decently and in
G15 0120 11    order", and the somewhat extreme prophecy, so far not
G15 0130  6    fulfilled: "They will be destroyed".
G15 0140  1       The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their
G15 0140 10    want not simply of decency but of imagination as well.
G15 0150 10    His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror
G15 0160  7    in the audience; it is a spectacle absolutely painful,
G15 0170  3    an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit,
G15 0180  3    untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation.
G15 0190  1    At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved-
G15 0190  9    the fat man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending
G15 0200 10    to be a baby- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon
G15 0210  6    the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, upon the
G15 0220  3    sinister dreams which form the sources of any human
G15 0230  1    life.
G15 0230  2       The music which La^utner has composed for this episode
G15 0240  1    is for the most part "rather pretty and perfectly banal".
G15 0240 11    But it is characteristic of him, we are told, "his
G15 0250 10    little artifice", to be able to introduce "into a fairly
G15 0260  9    vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase
G15 0270  5    of genuine creative art". And this occurs now, at the
G15 0280  4    refrain of Jacoby's song- at the point, in fact, of
G15 0290  1    the name "Lizzy"-; a modulation described as "almost
G15 0290  9    a stroke of genius". "A miracle, a revelation, it was
G15 0300  9    like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something
G15 0310  6    nude". It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby
G15 0320  5    his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, his
G15 0330  2    wife's infidelity. By the same means he perceives this
G15 0330 11    fact as having communicated itself to the audience;
G15 0340  8    he collapses, and dies.
G15 0350  1       In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may
G15 0350 11    be found one or more moments which strike the student
G15 0360  9    as absolutely decisive, ultimately emblematic of what
G15 0370  5    it is all about; not less strikingly so for being mysterious,
G15 0380  5    as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts
G15 0390  2    were enciphered in a single image, a single moment.
G15 0390 11    So here. The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual
G15 0400  7    embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous
G15 0410  5    image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing
G15 0420  2    up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh;
G15 0420 12    the bringing together around it of the secret liaison
G15 0430  9    between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd
G15 0440  6    talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius
G15 0450  4    (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem
G15 0460  3    of suffering"); the miraculous way in which music,
G15 0460 11    revelation and death are associated in a single instant-
G15 0470  9    all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate
G15 0480  8    art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous
G15 0490  4    and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's
G15 0500  1    work.
G15 0500  2       When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that
G15 0510  1    this passage is of critical significance, I come up
G15 0510 10    with the following ideas, which I shall express very
G15 0520  7    briefly here and revert to in a later essay.
G15 0530  4       Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's
G15 0540  1    heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories
G15 0540  8    characteristically
G15 0550  1    turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously
G15 0550 10    compelled and forbidden to love. The release, the freedom,
G15 0560  9    involved in loving another is either terribly difficult
G15 0570  6    or else absolutely impossible; and the motion toward
G15 0580  5    it brings disaster.
G15 0580  8       This prohibition on love has an especially poignant
G15 0590  7    relation to art; it is particularly the artist (Tonio
G15 0600  4    Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers from it.
G15 0610  3    The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the
G15 0610 13    problem of the "breakthrough" in the realm of art.
G15 0620  9       Again, the sufferings and disasters produced by
G15 0630  5    any transgression against the commandment not to love
G15 0640  4    are almost invariably associated in one way or another
G15 0650  1    with childhood, with the figure of a child.
G15 0650  9       Finally, the theatrical (and perversely erotic)
G15 0660  5    notions of dressing up, cosmetics, disguise, and especially
G15 0670  4    change of costume (or singularity of costume, as with
G15 0680  3    Cipolla), are characteristically associated with the
G15 0680  9    catastrophes of Mann's stories.
G15 0690  4       We shall return to these statements and deal with
G15 0700  4    them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.
G15 0710  1    For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque
G15 0710 13    figure of Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all
G15 0720  9    these elements come together in prophetic parody. Professionally
G15 0730  5    a lawyer, that is to say associated with dignity, reserve,
G15 0740  4    discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class,
G15 0750  3    he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself
G15 0760  1    dressed up, disguised- that is, paradoxically, revealed-
G15 0760  8    as a child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as
G15 0770  9    a child. That this abandonment takes place on a stage,
G15 0780  6    during an 'artistic' performance, is enough to associate
G15 0790  5    Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the punishment
G15 0800  2    for art; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable,
G15 0800 11    as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion,
G15 0810  9    and this is true even though the constant elements
G15 0820  7    of the artist-nature, technique, magic, guilt and suffering,
G15 0830  5    are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner.
G15 0840  3       It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's
G15 0850  2    early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque
G15 0850  9    the surface, is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic,
G15 0860  8    the expressionistic. In a certain perfectly definite
G15 0870  6    way, the method and the theme of his stories are one
G15 0880  4    and the same.
G15 0880  7       Something of this can be learned from "The Way to
G15 0890  5    the Churchyard" (1901), an anecdote about an old failure
G15 0900  4    whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him
G15 0900 14    to die of a stroke or seizure. There is no more "plot"
G15 0910 11    than that; only slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper
G15 0920  7    account of such an incident would give. The artistic
G15 0930  5    interest, then, lies in what the encounter may be made
G15 0940  4    to represent, in the power of some central significance
G15 0950  1    to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.
G15 0950  9       The first sentence, with its platitudinous irony,
G15 0960  6    announces an emblematic intent: "The way to the churchyard
G15 0970  6    ran along beside the highroad, ran beside it all the
G15 0980  5    way to the end; that is to say, to the churchyard".
G15 0990  1    And the action is consistently presented with regard
G15 0990  9    for this distinction. The highroad, one might say at
G15 1000  7    first, belongs to life, while the way to the churchyard
G15 1010  6    belongs to death. But that is too simple, and won't
G15 1020  3    hold up. As the first sentence suggests, both roads
G15 1020 12    belong to death in the end. But the highroad, according
G15 1030 10    to the description of its traffic, belongs to life
G15 1040  7    as it is lived in unawareness of death, while the way
G15 1050  4    to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life:
G15 1060  1    a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in
G15 1060  9    the awareness of death. Thus, on the highroad, a troop
G15 1070  9    of soldiers "marched in their own dust and sang", while
G15 1080  6    on the footpath one man walks alone.
G15 1090  1       This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it
G15 1090  9    is permanent. He is a widower, his three children are
G15 1100  9    dead, he has no one left on earth; also he is a drunk,
G15 1110  7    and has lost his job on that account. His name is Praisegod
G15 1120  4    Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to his
G15 1130  2    clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him
G15 1130 11    to a sinister type in the author's repertory- he is
G15 1140  8    a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in "Death
G15 1150  4    in Venice", for example, who represent some combination
G15 1160  3    of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.
G15 1160  8       This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because
G15 1170  7    the latter is using the path rather than the highroad.
G15 1180  5    The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace young fellow,
G15 1190  3    is not named but identified simply as "Life"- that
G15 1200  1    and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing
G15 1200 10    him. "Life" points out that "everybody uses this path",
G15 1210  8    and starts to ride on. Piepsam tries to stop him by
G15 1220  8    force, receives a push in the chest from "Life", and
G15 1230  4    is left standing in impotent and growing rage, while
G15 1240  2    a crowd begins to gather. His rage assumes a religious
G15 1240 12    form; that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and
G15 1250 11    abject wretchedness, Piepsam becomes a prophet who
G15 1260  6    in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom
G15 1270  3    on Life- not only the cyclist now, but the audience,
G15 1280  1    the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed". This
G15 1280 11    passion brings on a fit which proves fatal. Then an
G15 1290 10    ambulance comes along, and they drive Praisegod Piepsam
G15 1300  6    away.
G15 1300  7       This is simple enough, but several more points of
G15 1310  6    interest may be mentioned as relevant. The season,
G15 1320  2    between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree
G15 1330  1    aspect. Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because
G15 1330  9    he cannot stop the cyclist, but also because God will
G15 1340  9    not stop him; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last
G15 1350  8    moments: "His justice is not of this world".
G15 1360  3       Life is further characterized, in antithesis to
G15 1370  1    Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears
G15 1370 11    at several places, is first given as the criterion
G15 1380  8    of amiable, irrelevant interest aroused by life considered
G15 1390  5    simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon is "admirable",
G15 1400  3    "a pleasure to contemplate"; another wagon has no dog,
G15 1410  4    and therefore is "devoid of interest". Piepsam calls
G15 1420  1    the cyclist "cur" and "puppy" among other things, and
G15 1420 10    at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands
G15 1430  9    before him and howls into his face. The ambulance is
G15 1440  6    drawn by two "charming" little horses.
G15 1450  1       Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional
G15 1450  9    sense. His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically,
G15 1460  7    connected with his sinfulness; the two may in fact
G15 1470  8    be identical. His unsuccessful strivings to give up
G15 1480  5    drink are represented as religious strivings; he keeps
G15 1490  3    a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and "before this wardrobe
G15 1490 14    Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on
G15 1500  8    his knees, and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue-
G15 1510  7    and still in the end capitulated".
G15 1520  1       The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is
G15 1520 10    simply unreflective, unproblematic Life, "blithe and
G15 1530  6    carefree". "He made no claims to belong to the great
G15 1540  9    and mighty of this earth".
G15 1550  1       Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody; his end
G15 1550  9    is ridiculous and trivial. He is "a man raving mad
G15 1560  9    on the way to the churchyard". But he is more interesting
G15 1570  6    than the others, the ones who come from the highroad
G15 1580  3    to watch him, more interesting than Life considered
G15 1590  1    as a cyclist. And if I have gone into so much detail
G15 1590 13    about so small a work, that is because it is also so
G15 1600 10    typical a work, representing the germinal form of a
G15 1610  5    conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing:
G15 1620  1    the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical,
G15 1620 10    destructive and self-destructive tendencies, much that
G15 1630  7    is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of, for
G15 1640  6    instance, Naphta and Leverku^hn.
G15 1650  1       In method as well as in theme this little anecdote
G15 1650 11    with its details selected as much for expressiveness
G15 1660  6    and allegory as for "realism", anticipates a kind of
G15 1670  5    musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional
G15 1680  1    composition, in which, as Leverku^hn says, "there shall
G15 1680  9    be nothing unthematic". It resembles, too, pictures
G15 1690  7    such as Du^rer and Bruegel did, in which all that looks
G15 1700  9    at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection
G15 1710  4    to be also literary, the representation of a proverb,
G15 1720  2    for example, or a deadly sin.
G15 1720  8       "Gladius Dei" (1902) resembles "The Way to the Churchyard"
G15 1730  7    in its representation of a conflict between light and
G15 1740  7    dark, between "Life" and a spirit of criticism, negation,
G15 1750  4    melancholy, but it goes considerably further in characterizing
G15 1760  3    the elements of this conflict.
G15 1760  8       The monk Savonarola, brought over from the Renaissance
G15 1770  6    and placed against the background of Munich at the
G15 1780  5    turn of the century, protests against the luxurious
G15 1790  1    works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig;
G15 1790 10    in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous
G15 1800  9    style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's
G15 1810  7    mistress. Hieronymus, like Piepsam, makes his protest
G15 1820  6    quite in vain, and his rejection, though not fatal,
G15 1830  3    is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown
G15 1830 11    out of the shop by the porter. On the street outside,
G15 1840 11    Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of
G15 1850  7    this world, such a burning of artistic and erotic productions
G15 1860  4    as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence,
G15 1870  2    and prophetically he issues his curse: "Gladius Dei
G15 1880  1    super terram cito et velociter".
