G74 0010  1       Let us see just how typical Krim is. He is New York-born
G74 0020  1    and Jewish. He spent one year at the University of
G74 0020 11    North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there. He
G74 0030  7    returned to New York to work for The New Yorker, to
G74 0040  6    edit a Western pulp, to "duck the war in the OWI",
G74 0050  4    to write publicity for Paramount Pictures and commentary
G74 0060  2    for a newsreel, then he began his career as critic
G74 0060 12    for various magazines. Now he has abandoned all that
G74 0070  8    to be A Writer. I do not want to quibble about typicality;
G74 0080  7    in a certain sense, one manner of experience will be
G74 0090  5    typical of any given group while another will not.
G74 0100  1    But I've got news for Krim: he's not typical, he's
G74 0100 11    pretty special. His may typify a certain kind of postwar
G74 0110  9    New York experience, but his experience is certainly
G74 0120  6    not typical of his "generation's". In any case, who
G74 0130  5    ever thought that New York is typical of anything?
G74 0140  1       Men of Krim's age, aspirations, and level of sophistication
G74 0150  1    were typically involved in politics before the war.
G74 0150  9    They did not "duck the war" but they fought in it,
G74 0160 10    however reluctantly; they sweated out some kind of
G74 0170  7    formal education; they read widely and eclectically;
G74 0180  1    they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous
G74 0200  1    magazines, but they did whatever nasty thing they could
G74 0200 10    get in order to eat; they found out who they were and
G74 0210 12    what they could do, then within the limits of their
G74 0220  7    talent they did it. They did not worry about "experience",
G74 0230  3    because experience thrust itself upon them. And they
G74 0240  3    traveled out of New York. Only a native New Yorker
G74 0240 13    could believe that New York is now or ever was a literary
G74 0250 12    center. It is a publishing and public relations center,
G74 0260  8    but these very facts prevent it from being a literary
G74 0270  6    center because writers dislike provincialism and untruth.
G74 0280  3    Krim's typicality consists only in his New Yorker's
G74 0290  1    view that New York is the world; he displays what outlanders
G74 0300  1    call the New York mind, a state that the subject is
G74 0300 12    necessarily unable to perceive in himself. The New
G74 0310  7    York mind is two parts abstraction and one part misinformation
G74 0320  5    about the rest of the country and in fact the world.
G74 0330  3    In his fulminating against the literary world, Krim
G74 0330 11    is really struggling with the New Yorker in himself,
G74 0340  9    but it's a losing battle.
G74 0350  2       Closely related to his illusions about his typicality
G74 0360  1    is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness.
G74 0360  8    He writes, "Most of my friends and I were Jewish; we
G74 0370 10    were also literary; the combination of the Jewish intellectual
G74 0380  7    tradition and the sensibility needed to be a writer
G74 0390  6    created in my circle the most potent and incredible
G74 0400  2    intellectual-literary ambition I have ever seen or
G74 0400 10    could ever have imagined. Within themselves, just as
G74 0410  7    people, my friends were often tortured and unappeasably
G74 0420  5    bitter about being the offspring of this unhappily
G74 0430  2    unique-ingrown-screwedup breed; their reading and thinking
G74 0440  1    gave an extension to their normal blushes about appearing
G74 0450  9    'Jewish' in subway, bus, racetrack, movie house, any
G74 0460  8    of the public places that used to make the Jew of my
G74 0470  8    generation self-conscious (heavy thinkers walking across
G74 0480  3    Seventh Avenue without their glasses on, willing to
G74 0490  1    dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the
G74 0490 12    ikey-kikey caricature of the Yiddish intellectual)
G74 0500  5    ...". At other points in his narrative, Krim associates
G74 0510  4    Jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition, with
G74 0520  2    abstraction, with his personal turning aside from the
G74 0520 10    good, the true, and the beautiful of fiction in the
G74 0530 10    manner of James T. Farrell to the international, the
G74 0540  6    false, and the inflated.
G74 0550  1       Krim says, in short, that he is a suffering Jew.
G74 0550 10    The only possible answer to that is, I am a suffering
G74 0560  9    Franco-Irishman. We all love to suffer, but some of
G74 0570  6    us love to suffer more than others. Had Krim gone farther
G74 0580  2    from New York than Chapel Hill, he might have discovered
G74 0590  1    that large numbers of American Jews do not find his
G74 0590 11    New York version of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable.
G74 0600  7    More important is the simple human point that all men
G74 0610  7    suffer, and that it is a kind of anthropological-religious
G74 0620  1    pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering
G74 0630  1    is more poignant than mine or anyone else's. This is
G74 0630 11    not to deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos, but
G74 0640  9    only to assert that these horrors have had an effect
G74 0660  5    on the nerves of people who did not experience them,
G74 0670  2    that among the various side effects is the local hysteria
G74 0680  1    of Jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from
G74 0680 10    confusion, which they call oppression and pain. In
G74 0690  7    their stupidity and arrogance they believe they are
G74 0700  4    called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms
G74 0710  1    and ghettos. Some of us have imagination and sensibility
G74 0710 10    too. Finally, there is the undeniable fact that some
G74 0720  9    of the finest American fiction is being written by
G74 0730  6    Jews, but it is not Jewish fiction; Saul Bellow and
G74 0740  4    Bernard Malamud, through intellectual toughness, perception,
G74 0750  2    through experience in fact, have obviously liberated
G74 0760  1    themselves from any sentimental Krim self-indulgence
G74 0760  8    they might have been tempted to.
G74 0770  4       Krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and the
G74 0780  2    publishing apparatus of American literary culture in
G74 0780  9    our day. Krim was able to get an advance for a novel,
G74 0790 11    and time and opportunity to write at Yaddo, but it
G74 0800  7    was no good. "I had natural sock", he says, 'as a storyteller
G74 0810  5    and was precociously good at description, dialogue,
G74 0820  1    and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's
G74 0820 11    trade but I was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts
G74 0830 11    and feelings that prevented me from doing more than
G74 0840  7    just diddling the surface of sustained fiction-writing".
G74 0850  3    And again, "how can you write when you haven't yet
G74 0860  2    read 'Bartleby the Scrivener'"? Krim came to believe
G74 0870  1    that "the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning".
G74 0870 12    His "articulate Jewish friends" convinced him that
G74 0880  7    education (read "reading") was "a must". He moved in
G74 0890  7    a "highly intellectual" group in Greenwich Village
G74 0900  5    in the late forties, becoming "internationalized" overnight.
G74 0910  2    Then followed a period in which he wrote reviews for
G74 0920  2    The New York Times Book Review, The Commonweal, Commentary,
G74 0930  1    had a small piece in Partisan Review, and moved on
G74 0940  1    to Hudson, The Village Voice, and Exodus. The work
G74 0940 10    for Commonweal was more satisfying than work for Commentary
G74 0960  8    "because of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a
G74 0970  9    booboo". Commentary was a mere suburb of Partisan Review,
G74 0980  8    the arch-enemy. Both magazines were "rigid with reactionary
G74 0990  6    what-will-T. S. Eliot-or-Martin Buber-think? fear ...".
G74 1000  5    Partisan has failed, Krim says, for being "snob-clannish,
G74 1010  7    overcerebral, Europeanish, aristocratically alienated"
G74 1020  2    from the U.S. It was "the creation of a monstrous
G74 1030  4    historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize
G74 1040  1    literature and politics and avant-garde art of every
G74 1040 10    kind with its writers crazily trying to outdo each
G74 1050  8    other in Spenglerian inclusiveness ...". Kenyon, Sewanee,
G74 1060  4    and Hudson operated in an "Anglo-Protestant New Critical
G74 1070  3    chill"; their example caused Krim and his friends to
G74 1080  5    put on "Englishy airs, affect all sorts of impressive
G74 1090  1    scholarship and social-register unnaturalness ... in
G74 1090  8    order to slip through their narrow transoms and get
G74 1100  8    into their pages". Qui s'excuse s'accuse, as the French
G74 1110  6    Jewish intellectuals used to say.
G74 1120  3       Through all this raving, Krim is performing a traditional
G74 1130  1    and by now boring rite, the attack on intelligence,
G74 1130 10    upon the largely successful attempt of the magazines
G74 1140  6    he castigates to liberate American writing from local
G74 1150  4    color and other varieties of romantic corn. God knows
G74 1160  2    that Partisan and the rest often were, and remain,
G74 1160 11    guilty of intellectual flatulence. Sociological jargon,
G74 1170  6    Germano-Slavic approximations to English, third-rate
G74 1180  6    but modish fiction, and outrages to common sense have
G74 1190  5    often disfigured Partisan, and in lesser degree, the
G74 1200  2    other magazines on the list. What Krim ignores, in
G74 1200 11    his contempt for history and for accuracy, is that
G74 1210  8    these magazines, Partisan foremost, brought about a
G74 1220  5    genuine revolution in the American mind from the mid-thirties
G74 1230  5    to approximately 1950. The most obvious characteristic
G74 1240  1    of contemporary American writing, apart from the beat
G74 1240  9    nonsense, is its cosmopolitanism.
G74 1250  4       The process of cosmopolitanism had begun in earnest
G74 1260  5    about 1912, but the First War and the depression virtually
G74 1270  2    stalled that process in its tracks. Without the good
G74 1270 11    magazines, without their book reviews, their hospitality
G74 1280  7    to European writers, without above all their awareness
G74 1290  6    of literary standards, we might very well have had
G74 1300  5    a generation of Krim's heroes- Wolfes, Farrells, Dreisers,
G74 1310  2    and I might add, Sandburgs and Frosts and MacLeishes
G74 1320  1    in verse- and then where would we be? Screwed, stewed,
G74 1320 11    and tattooed, as Krim might say after reading a book
G74 1330  9    about sailors. When Partisan and Kenyon set up shop,
G74 1340  7    Mencken was still accepted as an arbiter of taste (remember
G74 1350  7    Hergesheimer?), George Jean Nathan and Alexander Woollcott
G74 1360  4    were honored in odd quarters, and the whole Booth Tarkington,
G74 1370  3    Willa Catheter (sic), Pearl Buck, Amy Lowell, William
G74 1380  3    Lyon Phelps atmosphere lay thick as Los Angeles smog
G74 1390  2    over the country.
G74 1390  5       Politics, economics, sociology- the entire area
G74 1400  3    of life that lies between literature and what Krim
G74 1400 12    calls "experience"- urgently needed to be dug into.
G74 1410  7    The universities certainly were not doing it, nor were
G74 1420  8    the popular magazines of the day. This Partisan above
G74 1430  4    all did; if it had never printed a word of literature
G74 1440  3    its contribution to the politico-sociological area
G74 1440 10    would still be historic. But it did print good verse
G74 1450 10    and good fiction. If the editors sometimes dozed and
G74 1460  6    printed pretentious, New York-mind dross, they also
G74 1470  4    printed Malraux, Silone, Chiaromonte, Gide, Bellow,
G74 1480  1    Robert Lowell, Francis Fergusson, Mary McCarthy, Delmore
G74 1490  1    Schwartz, Mailer, Elizabeth Hardwick, Eleanor Clark,
G74 1490  7    and a host of other good writers. Partisan Review and
G74 1500  8    the other literary magazines helped to educate, in
G74 1510  5    the best sense, an entire generation. That these magazines
G74 1520  3    also deluded the Krims of the world is unfortunate
G74 1530  1    but inevitable. It is a fact of life that magazines
G74 1530 11    are edited by groups: they have to be or they wouldn't
G74 1540  9    be published at all. And it is also a fact of life
G74 1550  8    that there will always be youngish half-educated people
G74 1560  2    around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks
G74 1560 13    like a literary movement. (There are no literary movements,
G74 1570  9    there are only writers doing their work. Literary movements
G74 1580  8    are the creation of pimps who live off writers.) When
G74 1590  7    Krim says "mine was as severe a critical-intellectual
G74 1600  3    environment as can be imagined", he is off his rocker.
G74 1610  2    He indicates that he has none of the disciplines that
G74 1610 12    criticism requires, including education; the result
G74 1620  6    was his inevitable bedazzlement through ignorance.
G74 1630  3    He wasn't being educated in those Village bull-sessions,
G74 1640  3    as he claims. No one was ever educated through bull-sessions
G74 1650  1    in anything other than, to quote him again, "perfumed
G74 1650 10    bullshit". Only a New York hick would expect to find
G74 1660 10    the literary life in Greenwich Village at any point
G74 1670  8    later than Walt Whitman's day. The "highly intellectual
G74 1680  5    ... minds" that Krim says he encountered in the Village
G74 1690  4    did their work in spite of, not because of, any Village
G74 1700  2    atmosphere. But Krim's complaint is important because
G74 1700  9    not only in New York, but in other cities and in universities
G74 1710 12    throughout this country, young and not so young men
G74 1720  9    at this moment are being bedazzled by half-digested
G74 1730  5    ideas. Those who have quality will outgrow the experience;
G74 1740  3    the rest will turn beat, or into dentists, or into
G74 1750  1    beat dentists.
G74 1750  3       For the sad truth is that while one might write
G74 1760  1    well without having read "Bartleby the Scrivener",
G74 1760  8    one is more likely to write well if one has read it,
G74 1770 10    and much else. The most appalling aspect of Krim's
G74 1780  4    piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic. He mentions
G74 1790  3    the beats only once, when he refers to their having
G74 1790 13    "revived through mere power and abandonment and the
G74 1800  8    unwillingness to commit death in life some idea of
G74 1810  7    a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual
G74 1820  3    experience ...", but the entire narrative is written
G74 1830  1    in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause,
G74 1830 11    and in the sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant
G74 1840  8    our mother tongue. Krim's aesthetic combines
G74 1850  3    anti-intellectualism,
G74 1850  5    conscious and unconscious nai^vete, and a winsome reliance
G74 1860  6    upon the "natural" and upon "experience". Ideas are
G74 1870  3    the "thruway to nowhere". "My touchstones ... had been
G74 1880  4    strictly literature and, humanly enough, American literature
G74 1890  2    (because that was what I wanted to write)". He alludes
G74 1900  1    to something called "direct writing", and he finds
G74 1900  9    that criticism gets in the way of his "truer, realer,
G74 1910  9    imaginative bounce".
