J38 0010  1       Unemployed older workers who have no expectation
J38 0010  8    of securing employment in the occupation in which they
J38 0020  7    are skilled should be able to secure counseling and
J38 0030  4    retraining in an occupation with a future. Some vocational
J38 0040  2    training schools provide such training, but the current
J38 0050  1    need exceeds the facilities.
J38 0050  5    _CURRENT PROGRAMS_
J38 0050  7       The present Federal program of vocational education
J38 0060  5    began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes
J38 0070  4    Act, which provided a continuing annual appropriation
J38 0080  1    of $7 million to support, on a matching basis, state-administered
J38 0090  1    programs of vocational education in agriculture, trades,
J38 0090  8    industrial skills and home economics. Since 1917 some
J38 0100  7    thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended
J38 0110  4    this Federal program. The George-Barden Act of 1946
J38 0120  4    raised the previous increases in annual authorizations
J38 0120 11    to $29 million in addition to the $7 million under
J38 0130 10    the Smith Act. The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added
J38 0140  7    $5 million for practical nurse training.
J38 0150  2       The latest major change in this program was introduced
J38 0160  1    by the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Title
J38 0160 10    VIII of which amended the George-Barden Act. Annual
J38 0170  8    authorizations of $15 million were added for area vocational
J38 0180  7    education programs that meet national defense needs
J38 0190  3    for highly skilled technicians.
J38 0190  7       The Federal program of vocational education merely
J38 0200  6    provides financial aid to encourage the establishment
J38 0210  3    of vocational education programs in public schools.
J38 0220  2    The initiative, administration and control remain primarily
J38 0230  1    with the local school districts. Even the states remain
J38 0230 10    primarily in an assisting role, providing leadership
J38 0240  6    and teacher training.
J38 0250  1       Federal assistance is limited to half of the total
J38 0250  9    expenditure, and the state or local districts must
J38 0260  6    pay at least half. The state may decide to encourage
J38 0270  3    local programs by paying half of the cost, or the state
J38 0280  1    may require the local district to bear this half or
J38 0280 11    some part of it. Throughout the history of the program,
J38 0290  7    state government expenditures in the aggregate have
J38 0300  5    usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures,
J38 0310  1    while local districts all together have spent more
J38 0310  9    than either Federal or state governments. Today, Federal
J38 0320  7    funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures
J38 0330  7    for vocational education. The greatest impact of the
J38 0340  5    matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging
J38 0350  2    the poorest states and school districts to spend enough
J38 0360  1    to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.
J38 0360  9       National defense considerations have been the major
J38 0370  6    reason behind most Federal training expenditures in
J38 0380  4    recent decades. During World War II about 7.5 million
J38 0390  3    persons were enrolled in courses organized under two
J38 0390 11    special programs administered by state and local school
J38 0400  8    authorities: (1) Vocational Education for National
J38 0410  5    Defense, and (2) War Production Training. The total
J38 0420  4    cost of the five-year program was $297 million. For
J38 0430  2    the Smith-Hughes, George-Barden, and National Defense
J38 0440  1    Act of 1958, the cumulative total of Federal expenditures
J38 0440 10    in 42 years was only about $740 million.
J38 0450  6       No comparable measures are available of enrollments
J38 0460  3    and expenditures for private vocational education training.
J38 0470  2    There are a great number and variety of private commercial
J38 0480  1    schools, trade schools and technical schools. In addition,
J38 0480  9    many large corporations operate their own formal training
J38 0490  7    programs. A recent study indicated that 85 per cent
J38 0500  6    of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational
J38 0510  3    programs involving some class meetings and examinations.
J38 0520  1       Most skilled industrial workers, nevertheless, still
J38 0530  1    acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions.
J38 0530  9    The National Manpower Council of Columbia University
J38 0540  6    has estimated that three out of five skilled workers
J38 0550  7    and one out of five technicians have not been formally
J38 0560  4    trained.
J38 0560  5       There is little doubt that the students benefit
J38 0570  2    from vocational education. Employers prefer to hire
J38 0570  9    youth with such training rather than those without,
J38 0580  8    and most graduates of vocational training go to work
J38 0590  6    in jobs related to their training. Vocational educators
J38 0600  2    do not claim that school training alone makes skilled
J38 0610  1    workers, but it provides the essential groundwork for
J38 0610  9    developing skills.
J38 0620  1       In most states, trade and industrial training is
J38 0620  9    provided in a minority of the high schools, usually
J38 0630  9    located in the larger cities. In Arkansas fewer than
J38 0640  5    6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial
J38 0650  3    courses. In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools
J38 0660  1    have programs, and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent.
J38 0660  9       An important recent trend is the development of
J38 0670  7    area vocational schools. For a number of years Kentucky,
J38 0680  6    Louisiana and several other states have been building
J38 0690  3    state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve
J38 0700  1    nearby school districts in several counties. These
J38 0700  8    schools are intended to provide the facilities and
J38 0710  6    specialized curriculum that would not be possible for
J38 0720  4    very small school districts. Transportation may be
J38 0730  1    provided from nearby school districts. Courses are
J38 0730  8    provided mainly for post high school day programs;
J38 0740  6    but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school
J38 0750  5    students to attend, and evening extension courses also
J38 0760  2    may be conducted.
J38 0760  5       The Title VIII program of the National Defense Education
J38 0770  3    Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area
J38 0780  2    schools. By 1960 there were such schools in all but
J38 0780 12    4 states. They were operating in 10 of the 17 major
J38 0790 10    areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor
J38 0800  8    areas. An extension of this program into the other
J38 0810  3    distressed areas should be undertaken.
J38 0820  1    _RELATION TO NEW INDUSTRY_
J38 0820  2       Some of this trend toward area vocational schools
J38 0820 10    has been related to the problems of persistent labor
J38 0830  8    surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry.
J38 0840  6       The major training need of a new industrial plant
J38 0850  3    is a short period of pre-employment training for a
J38 0860  1    large number of semi-skilled machine operators. A few
J38 0860 10    key skilled workers experienced in the company's type
J38 0870  6    of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager,
J38 0880  6    or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere. A prospective
J38 0890  3    industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages
J38 0900  2    of training programs in the area to supply future skilled
J38 0900 12    workers and provide supplementary extension courses
J38 0910  6    for its employees.
J38 0920  1       The existence of a public school vocational training
J38 0920  9    program in trade and industry provides a base from
J38 0930  8    which such needs can be filled. Additional courses
J38 0940  3    can readily be added and special cooperative programs
J38 0950  1    worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities,
J38 0950 11    staff and program are in being. Thus, besides the training
J38 0960 10    provided to youth in school, the existence of the school
J38 0970  8    program can have supplementary benefits to industry
J38 0980  4    which make it an asset to industrial development efforts.
J38 0990  2       Few states make effective use of their existing
J38 0990 10    vocational education programs or funds for the purpose
J38 1000  8    of attracting new industry. The opportunity exists
J38 1010  5    for states to reserve some of their vocational education
J38 1020  3    funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize
J38 1030  3    any local preemployment training programs that my be
J38 1030 11    quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial
J38 1040 11    plant.
J38 1050  1    _LOCAL FOCUS OF PROGRAMS_
J38 1050  3       The major weakness of vocational training programs
J38 1050 10    in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely
J38 1060 10    local job demands. This weakness is not unique to labor
J38 1070  8    surplus areas, for it is inherent in the system of
J38 1080  5    local school districts in this country.
J38 1090  1       Planning of vocational education programs and courses
J38 1090  8    is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers.
J38 1100  7    All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress
J38 1110  5    the importance of first making a local survey of skill
J38 1120  4    needs, of estimating the growth of local jobs, and
J38 1130  2    of consulting with local employers on the types of
J38 1130 11    courses and their content.
J38 1140  3       Furthermore, there is a cautious conservatism on
J38 1150  2    the part of those making local skill surveys. Local
J38 1150 11    jobs can be seen and counted, while opportunities elsewhere
J38 1160  6    are regarded as more hypothetical.
J38 1170  1       While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program
J38 1180  2    of projecting industry and occupational employment
J38 1180  8    trends and publishing current outlook statements, there
J38 1190  6    is little tangible evidence that these projections
J38 1200  4    have been used extensively in local curriculum planning.
J38 1210  2    The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local
J38 1220  2    surveys rather than national surveys.
J38 1220  7       This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic
J38 1230  5    labor surplus areas with a long history of declining
J38 1240  3    employment. Elaborate studies have been made in labor
J38 1250  1    surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers
J38 1250  9    of local job vacancies and future replacement needs
J38 1260  6    for certain skills to justify training programs for
J38 1270  4    those skills. No effort is made in the same studies
J38 1280  1    to present information on regional or national demand
J38 1280  9    trends in these skills or to consider whether regional
J38 1290  7    or national demands for other skills might provide
J38 1300  4    much better opportunities for the youth to be trained.
J38 1310  2       Moreover, the current information on what types
J38 1310  9    of training are needed and possible is too limited
J38 1320  8    and fragmentary. There simply is not enough material
J38 1330  6    available on the types of job skills that are in demand
J38 1340  4    and the types of training programs that are required
J38 1350  1    or most suitable. Much of the available information
J38 1350  9    comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange
J38 1360  7    of experiences among states.
J38 1370  1    _PROPOSALS_
J38 1370  2       State and local agencies in the vocational education
J38 1380  1    field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on
J38 1380 11    future job opportunities. There is a need for an expanded
J38 1390  8    Federal effort to provide research and information
J38 1400  4    to help guide state education departments and local
J38 1410  2    school boards in existing programs.
J38 1410  7       A related question is whether unemployed workers
J38 1420  5    can be motivated to take the training provided. There
J38 1430  2    is little evidence that existing public or private
J38 1430 10    training programs have any great difficulty getting
J38 1440  7    students to enroll in their programs, even though they
J38 1450  6    must pay tuition, receive no subsistence payments,
J38 1460  2    and are not guaranteed a job. However, there always
J38 1460 11    is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time
J38 1470 11    and effort to acquire training. Again, one major difficulty
J38 1480  6    is the local focus.
J38 1490  1       A training program in a depressed area may have
J38 1490  9    few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect
J38 1500  5    for better employment opportunities afterwards, and
J38 1510  2    the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely
J38 1520  1    at jobs in the local community. If there is adequate
J38 1520 11    information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere,
J38 1530  6    many more workers can be expected to respond.
J38 1540  4       Another problem is who will pay for the training.
J38 1550  1    Local school districts are hard pressed financially
J38 1550  8    and unenthusiastic about vocational training. Programs
J38 1560  5    usually are expanded only when outside funds are available
J38 1570  6    or local business leaders demand it. Even industrial
J38 1580  4    development leaders find it hard to win local support
J38 1590  1    for training unless a new industry is in sight and
J38 1590 11    requests it. State governments have been taking the
J38 1600  6    lead in establishing area vocational schools, but their
J38 1610  4    focus is still on area job opportunities. Only the
J38 1620  2    Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run
J38 1620 14    and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet
J38 1630 11    national skilled manpower needs.
J38 1640  2       If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational
J38 1650  1    education, it could be argued that the state should
J38 1650 10    not have to bear the cost of vocational training which
J38 1660  8    would benefit employers in other states. However, if
J38 1670  5    Federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate
J38 1680  2    to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere
J38 1690  1    as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.
J38 1690 12    Such training would increase the tendency of workers
J38 1700  7    to leave the area and find jobs in other localities.
J38 1710  5       A further possibility is suggested by the example
J38 1720  4    of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in
J38 1730  2    attitudes toward improving college education: that
J38 1730  8    is to provide financial assistance to individuals for
J38 1740  6    vocational training when local facilities are inadequate.
J38 1750  4    This probably would require some support for subsistence
J38 1760  3    as well as for tuition, but the total would be no greater
J38 1770  2    than for the proposals of unemployment compensation
J38 1770  9    or a Youth Conservation Corps. A maximum of $600 per
J38 1780  8    year per student would enable many to take training
J38 1790  6    away from home.
J38 1790  9       A program of financial assistance would permit placing
J38 1800  5    emphasis on the national interest in training highly
J38 1810  4    skilled labor. Instead of being limited to the poor
J38 1820  1    training facilities in remote areas, the student would
J38 1820  9    be able to move to large institutions of concentrated
J38 1830  7    specialized training. Such specialized training institutions
J38 1840  4    could be located near the most rapidly growing industries,
J38 1850  3    where the equipment and job experience exist and where
J38 1870  2    the future employment opportunities are located. This
J38 1870  9    would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative,
J38 1880  6    on-the-job and extension training.
J38 1890  2       Personal financial assistance would enable more
J38 1900  1    emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual.
J38 1900 11    His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight
J38 1910  8    in selecting the proper training.
