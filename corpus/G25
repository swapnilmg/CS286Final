G25 0010  1    For this change is not a change from one positive position
G25 0010 12    to another, but a change from order and truth to disorder
G25 0020 10    and negation. The liberal-conservative division, we
G25 0030  3    might observe in passing, is not of itself directly
G25 0040  2    involved in a private interest conflict nor even in
G25 0040 11    struggle between ruling groups. Rather it is rooted
G25 0050  8    in a difference of response to the threat of social
G25 0060  6    disintegration. The division is not between those who
G25 0070  3    wish to preserve what they have and those who want
G25 0070 13    change. Rather it is a division established by two
G25 0080  9    absolutely different ways of thought with regard to
G25 0090  6    man's life in society. These ways are absolutely irreconcilable
G25 0100  3    because they offer two different recipes for man's
G25 0110  2    redemption from chaos.
G25 0110  5       The civilizational crisis, the third type of change
G25 0120  5    raises the question "what are we to do"? on the most
G25 0130  4    primitive level. For the answer cannot be derived from
G25 0130 13    any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community.
G25 0140  8    There is no socially existential answer to the question.
G25 0150  7    For the truth formerly experienced by the community
G25 0160  4    no longer has existential status in the community,
G25 0170  1    nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians.
G25 0180  1    In this phase of change, no idea has social acceptance
G25 0180 11    and so none has ontological status in the community.
G25 0190  7    An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete
G25 0200  6    for existence.
G25 0200  8       If we examine the three types of change from the
G25 0210  7    point of view of their internal structure we find an
G25 0220  4    additional profound difference between the third and
G25 0220 11    the first two, one that accounts for the notable difference
G25 0230 10    between the responses they evoke. The first two types
G25 0240  8    of change occur within the inward and immanent structure
G25 0250  5    of the society. The first involves a simple shift of
G25 0260  3    interests in the society. The second involves something
G25 0270  1    deeper, but its characteristic form focuses on a shift
G25 0270 10    in policy for the community, not in the truth on which
G25 0280  9    the community rests. Thus in both types attention is
G25 0290  5    focused on the community itself, and its phenomenological
G25 0300  1    life. The third type, however, wrenches attention from
G25 0310  1    the life of action and interests in the community and
G25 0310 11    focuses it on the ground of being on which the community
G25 0320  8    depends for its existence. Voegelin has analyzed this
G25 0330  4    experience in the case of the stable, healthy community.
G25 0340  2    There the community, faced with the need to formulate
G25 0340 11    policy on the level of absolute justice, can find the
G25 0350 10    answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it
G25 0360  7    holds as partially experienced. This, however, cannot
G25 0370  3    be done by a community whose very experience of truth
G25 0380  1    is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard,
G25 0380 10    and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from
G25 0390  6    the contingent. It has lost its ground of being and
G25 0400  7    floats in a mist of appearances. Relativism and equality
G25 0410  3    are its characteristic diseases. Precisely at the moment
G25 0420  1    when it has lost its vision the mind of the community
G25 0420 12    turns out from itself in a search for the ontological
G25 0430  9    standard whereby it can measure itself. For paradigmatic
G25 0440  4    history "breaks" rather than unfolds precisely when
G25 0450  3    the movement is from order to disorder, and not from
G25 0460  1    one order to a new order. The liberal-conservative
G25 0460 10    split, to define it further, derives from a basic difference
G25 0470  8    concerning the existential status of standard sought
G25 0480  5    and about the spiritual experience that leads to its
G25 0490  3    identification.
G25 0490  4       When disruptive change has penetrated to the third
G25 0500  4    level of social order, the process of disruption rapidly
G25 0510  1    reaches a point of no return. Indeed, it is probable
G25 0510 11    that this point is reached the moment the third level
G25 0520  8    of change begins. At that point we reach the "closed"
G25 0530  5    historical situation: the situation in which man is
G25 0540  4    no longer free to return to a status quo ante. At that
G25 0550  1    point men become aware of the mystery of history called
G25 0550 11    variously "fate", or "destiny", or "providence", and
G25 0560  6    feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of
G25 0570  7    a disrupted society. The reasons for this experience
G25 0580  4    are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such
G25 0590  2    a change.
G25 0590  4       Of all forms of being, society, or community, has
G25 0610  2    the greatest element of determinability. Its ontological
G25 0610  9    status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual
G25 0620  8    men, who are its "matter", tradition, the "form" of
G25 0630  5    society exists only as a shared perception of truth.
G25 0640  4    The ontological status of society thus is constituted
G25 0650  1    by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status
G25 0650  7    of society's members. The content of that psychological
G25 0660  7    status determines, ultimately, the content of civilization.
G25 0670  6    Those social, civilizational factors not rooted in
G25 0680  5    the human spirit of the group, ultimately cease to
G25 0690  2    exist. Civilization itself- tradition- falls out of
G25 0690  9    existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused.
G25 0700  8    Civilization is what man has made of himself. Its massive
G25 0710  8    contours are rooted in the simple need of man, since
G25 0720  5    he is always incomplete, to complete himself.
G25 0730  1       It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse.
G25 0730 12    He needs existential completion, he needs, that is,
G25 0740  6    to move in the direction of completion. And the direction
G25 0750  4    of that movement is determined by his perception of
G25 0760  2    the truth about himself. He must, consequently, exist
G25 0760 10    as a self-perceived substantive, developing agent,
G25 0770  6    or he does not exist as man. Thus, it is no mystical
G25 0780  7    intuition, but an analyzable conception to say that
G25 0790  4    man and his tradition can "fall out of existence".
G25 0790 13    This happens at the moment man loses the perception
G25 0800  9    of moral substance in himself, of a nature that, in
G25 0810  8    Maritain's words, is perceived as a "locus of intelligible
G25 0820  5    necessities". An existentialist is a man who perceives
G25 0830  3    himself only as "esse", as existence without substance.
G25 0840  1       Thus human perception and human volition is the
G25 0840  9    immanent cause of all social change and this most truly
G25 0850 10    when the change reaches the civilizational level. Thus
G25 0860  5    with regard to the loss of tradition, in the change
G25 0870  4    from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works
G25 0880  1    itself out as a disruption of the individual soul,
G25 0880 10    a change in which man continues as an objective ontological
G25 0890  6    existent, but no longer as a man.
G25 0900  2       Further, change is a form of motion, it occurs as
G25 0900 12    the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency
G25 0910 12    and has not yet reached the terminus of the change.
G25 0920  6    With regard to the change we are examining, the question
G25 0930  3    is, at what point does the change become irreversible?
G25 0940  1    A number of considerations suggest that this occurs
G25 0940  9    early in the process. Change involves the displacement
G25 0950  7    of form. This means that the inception of change itself
G25 0960  6    can begin only when the factors conducive to change
G25 0970  3    have already become more powerful than those anchoring
G25 0980  1    the existent form in being. If the existent form is
G25 0980 11    to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be
G25 0990  7    introduced into the situation. In the case of social
G25 1000  5    decay, form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution
G25 1010  2    with no form at the terminus of the process. Now in
G25 1010 13    the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement
G25 1020  9    we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness
G25 1030  5    of the fading form. And when we consider the tenuous
G25 1040  3    hold tradition has on existence, any weakening of that
G25 1050  1    hold constitutes a crisis of existence. The retention
G25 1050  9    of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates
G25 1060  7    the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation.
G25 1070  6    However, the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening
G25 1080  4    of spiritual forces. It would seem, therefore, that
G25 1090  1    in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself.
G25 1090  9    The emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute
G25 1100  9    a warranty for the victory of disorder. And it would
G25 1110  6    seem that history is a witness to this truth.
G25 1120  2       As a further characterization of the liberal conservative
G25 1130  1    split we may observe that it involves differences in
G25 1130 10    the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history.
G25 1140  5    These differences, in turn, derive from prior differences
G25 1150  4    concerning the friendly or hostile character of change.
G25 1160  3    #UNANALYZED RESPONSES#
G25 1160  5    ANXIETY AND DEEP INSECURITY are the characteristic
G25 1170  4    responses evoked by the crisis in tradition. To experience
G25 1180  3    them, it is not necessary for a people to be actively
G25 1190  1    aware of what is happening to it. The process of erosion
G25 1190 12    need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences
G25 1200  9    begin unfolding within the individual, while in institutions
G25 1210  7    a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs.
G25 1220  4    Within the individual the reaction has been called
G25 1230  2    various names, all, however, pointing to the same basic
G25 1230 11    experience. Weil identifies it as being "rootless",
G25 1240  7    Guardini as being "placeless", Riesman as being "lonely".
G25 1250  6    Others call it "alienation", and mean by that no simple
G25 1260  7    economic experience (as Marx does) but a deep spiritual
G25 1270  6    sense of dislocation. Within institutions there is
G25 1280  3    a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the
G25 1280 13    substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades
G25 1290  8    as the earlier one of persuasion. We note the use of
G25 1300  8    rhetoric as a weapon, the manipulation of the masses
G25 1310  4    by propaganda, the "mobilization" of effort and resources.
G25 1320  2       Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed
G25 1330  1    responses to the experience of civilizational crisis,
G25 1330  8    two basic organizations of response are observable:
G25 1340  5    reaction and ideological progressivism. These responses
G25 1360  3    are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent
G25 1370  1    in the crisis. Both are predictably destined to fail.
G25 1370 10       The response of reaction is dominated by a concern
G25 1380  9    for what is vanishing. Its essence lies in its attempt
G25 1390  7    to recover previous order through the repression of
G25 1400  4    disruptive forces. To this end political authority
G25 1410  1    is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive
G25 1410 10    powers. The implicit assumption of this response is
G25 1420  6    that history is reversible. Seemingly, order is perceived
G25 1430  4    as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious
G25 1440  2    accretions. The problem is to remove the accretions
G25 1440 10    and thereby uncover the order that was always there.
G25 1450  9    Such a response, of course, misses the point that in
G25 1460  7    crisis order is going out of existence. Moreover its
G25 1470  3    posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed
G25 1480  1    to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of
G25 1480  9    the existent form of order, once the activation of
G25 1490  6    change has reached visible proportions. The most reaction
G25 1500  4    can achieve is stasis, and a stasis that can be maintained
G25 1510  1    only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately
G25 1510 10    exhausts itself.
G25 1520  2       Despite the hopelessness of the response, it is
G25 1520 10    explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself.
G25 1530  9    Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis
G25 1540  6    in private interests and in the ruling class, reaction
G25 1550  3    is normally found among those who feel themselves to
G25 1560  2    be among the ruling class. Their great error is to
G25 1560 12    mingle the responses typical of each of the three types
G25 1570  8    of change. Since civilizational change is the most
G25 1580  5    difficult to perceive and analyze, it seldom is given
G25 1590  2    adequate attention. And the anxiety it generates is
G25 1590 10    misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and
G25 1600  7    threatened social status.
G25 1610  1       The basic truth in the reactionary response is to
G25 1610 10    be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy
G25 1620  6    of the real over the ideational. But this truth is
G25 1630  5    distorted by its extreme application: the assumption
G25 1640  1    of the separate existence of tradition. The reactionary
G25 1640  9    misses the point that tradition exists ontologically
G25 1650  7    only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations.
G25 1660  2    Reactionary theories, for this reason, usually assume
G25 1670  3    some form of organismic theory. In its defensive formulations,
G25 1680  2    the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds
G25 1680 11    of the independent existence of the community. In its
G25 1690  9    dynamic form, it visualizes the community as the embodiment
G25 1700  7    of an ontological force- the race, for instance, which
G25 1710  6    unfolds in history. In both cases the individual tends
G25 1720  3    to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality.
G25 1730  1       When the reactionary response is thus bolstered
G25 1730  8    by an intellectual defense, the characteristics of
G25 1740  5    that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic
G25 1750  6    attitudes of unanalyzed reaction. Reaction is rooted
G25 1760  2    in a perception of tradition as a whole. It is a total
G25 1760 14    situation that is defended: the "good old days". There
G25 1770  9    is no selectivity; even the questionable features of
G25 1780  6    the past are defended. The point is that the reactionary,
G25 1790  5    for whatever motive, perceives himself to have been
G25 1800  3    part or a partner of something that extended beyond
G25 1800 12    himself, something which, consequently, he was not
G25 1810  7    able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective
G25 1820  6    preference. The reactionary is confused about the existential
G25 1830  3    status of a decaying tradition, but he does perceive
G25 1840  1    the unity tradition had when it was healthy.
