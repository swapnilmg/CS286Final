F40 0010  1    In the final accounting, these would have augmented
F40 0010  9    the bill for both sides. An estimate of one million
F40 0020  7    dollars is probably not excessive.
F40 0030  1       Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden
F40 0030 11    litigation, which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly
F40 0040  7    contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure.
F40 0050  5    The duration and other circumstances of the Selden
F40 0060  4    case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses
F40 0060 14    of patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have
F40 0070  9    seen, came before the courts when patent attorneys,
F40 0080  6    inventors, and laymen were making mounting demands
F40 0090  2    for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among
F40 0100  1    the defects they singled out were the complicated and
F40 0100 10    wearisome procedures in equity.
F40 0110  3       In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, Judge
F40 0120  2    Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation
F40 0120 10    to such criticism. "It is a duty", said Hough, "not
F40 0130  8    to let pass this opportunity of protesting against
F40 0140  4    the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity,
F40 0150  3    current in this circuit (and probably others), excused
F40 0160  1    if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court,
F40 0160 11    especially to be found in patent causes, and flagrantly
F40 0170  8    exemplified in this litigation. As long as the bar
F40 0180  6    prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, rather
F40 0190  2    than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer,
F40 0200  1    I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged,
F40 0200 10    and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic
F40 0210  7    of Equity". Observing that "reforms sometimes begin
F40 0220  5    with the contemplation of horrible examples", Hough
F40 0230  3    catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures.
F40 0240  2    He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case
F40 0250  1    record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits;
F40 0250  8    the numerous squabbles over minor matters; the "objections
F40 0260  7    stated at outrageous length"; and the frequent and
F40 0270  6    rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled for and unjustifiable,
F40 0290  2    from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".
F40 0300  1       The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case
F40 0300  9    was "a striking (though not singular) example", concluded
F40 0310  8    Hough, "will remain as long as testimony is taken without
F40 0320  9    any authoritative judicial officer present, and responsible
F40 0330  5    for the maintenance of discipline, and the reception
F40 0340  4    or exclusion of testimony".
F40 0340  8       Not least among the members of the patent bar who
F40 0350  9    echoed this powerful indictment were those who had
F40 0360  5    participated in the Selden suit. William A. Redding
F40 0370  2    asserted that if the case had been heard in open court
F40 0370 13    under rules of evidence, the testimony would have been
F40 0380  9    completed in sixty days instead of five years. Inventors
F40 0390  7    joined lawyers in the clamor for reform, inevitably
F40 0400  3    centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible
F40 0410  1    example". Its costive deliberations were likened to
F40 0410  8    those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly
F40 0420  7    caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House.
F40 0430  3       Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism,
F40 0440  1    did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural
F40 0440  8    defects. But he felt that the Selden case was being
F40 0450  9    unfairly pilloried. In a detailed letter published
F40 0460  3    in the Scientific American in 1912, he remarked that
F40 0470  3    "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding
F40 0480  1    of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated
F40 0480  9    as a single action, actually embraced five cases. Parker
F40 0490  7    insisted that the size of the record would have been
F40 0500  7    drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication
F40 0510  2    of testimony.
F40 0510  4       In a private communication written in 1911, Parker
F40 0520  4    had been more to the point. Noting the complaints of
F40 0530  2    inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted
F40 0530 11    that some of the strictures "were fairly well founded",
F40 0540  8    but he added that under existing rules the courts could
F40 0550  6    not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving
F40 0560  4    separate infringements of the same patent. The vast
F40 0570  2    industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit,
F40 0570 10    as well as the complex character of the automotive
F40 0580  6    art, encouraged both sides to exploit "every possible
F40 0590  3    chance" for or against the patent, said Parker. "This
F40 0600  2    very seldom happens in this class or in other cases,
F40 0600 12    and of course all of these matters led to a volume
F40 0610 11    and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily
F40 0620  5    would occur".
F40 0620  7       Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for
F40 0630  6    reducing the cost and mass of testimony. The most important
F40 0640  4    of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for
F40 0650  3    reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate
F40 0660  1    or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before
F40 0660  8    officers of the court who had no authority to limit
F40 0670  7    testimony. The taking of depositions, he suggested,
F40 0680  3    should be placed under a special court examiner empowered
F40 0690  1    to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude
F40 0690 10    immaterial testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden
F40 0700  9    case had this power existed and this course [been]
F40 0710  6    pursued, it would have shortened the depositions of
F40 0720  4    some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of
F40 0730  1    the other witnesses thereto more than that".
F40 0730  8       In the end Hough's acidulous protest, which Parker
F40 0740  5    called the "now somewhat famous note on this 'Selden'
F40 0750  5    case", did not go unheeded. In 1912 the United States
F40 0760  4    Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity
F40 0770  1    which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised
F40 0770 10    procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under
F40 0780  9    the new rules, testimony is taken orally in open court
F40 0790  7    in all cases except those of an extraordinary character.
F40 0800  2    Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity,
F40 0810  2    limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement
F40 0810 10    suits. One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if
F40 0820  9    the Selden case had been tried under this simplified
F40 0830  8    procedure, the testimony which filled more than a score
F40 0840  7    of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication
F40 0850  5    alone, could have been contained in one volume". While
F40 0860  2    patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive
F40 0870  1    forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants
F40 0870  9    uncounted sums of money. There is little doubt that
F40 0880  8    they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct
F40 0890  5    result of the Selden patent suit.
F40 0890 11    #3#
F40 0890 12    Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the
F40 0900  9    A.L.A.M. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade,
F40 0910  9    the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile
F40 0920  7    Manufacturers Association. The trade bodies which came
F40 0930  6    in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative,
F40 0940  4    for they never adopted a policy of exclusion. Nevertheless,
F40 0950  2    it is from the Selden organization that the industry
F40 0960  1    inherited its institutional machinery for furthering
F40 0960  7    the broader interests of the trade. One of the chief
F40 0970  8    features of this community of interest is the automotive
F40 0980  4    patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone in the
F40 0990  3    development of American industrial cooperation. Its
F40 0990  9    origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its
F40 1000  9    aftermath.
F40 1000 10       From the earliest days of the motor car industry,
F40 1010  9    before the A.L.A.M. was established, patent infringement
F40 1020  5    loomed as a serious and vexing problem. Many patent
F40 1030  5    contests were waged over automobile components and
F40 1040  2    accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball
F40 1040  9    bearings, license brackets, and electric horns. The
F40 1050  7    fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted
F40 1060  5    a general disregard of patent claims. As early as 1900
F40 1070  4    a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with
F40 1080  1    the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile
F40 1080  9    manufacturers. This scheme failed, and the following
F40 1090  7    decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among
F40 1100  3    individual manufacturers that reached its crest in
F40 1110  2    1912.
F40 1110  3       In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing
F40 1120  1    scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved
F40 1130  1    to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the
F40 1130 11    burdens of incessant litigation. The interchange of
F40 1140  5    shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement
F40 1150  3    suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool
F40 1160  3    (although it did not protect them against outside actions)
F40 1170  2    and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization
F40 1170 10    of automotive technology. One of the conditions of
F40 1180  7    the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of
F40 1190  5    patent rights among A.L.A.M. members. Within its limits,
F40 1200  4    this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics
F40 1210  1    of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features
F40 1220  1    outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of
F40 1220 11    a wouldbe monopoly. Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced
F40 1230  6    only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents,
F40 1240  7    the denial of rights to independent companies did not
F40 1250  4    retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of
F40 1260  2    the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on
F40 1260 10    the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M.
F40 1270  8    pool. But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission
F40 1280  6    in his Model T and earlier cars and, in 1905, as a
F40 1290  7    precautionary measure, took out a license from the
F40 1300  3    man who claimed to be its inventor.
F40 1300 10       For those affiliated with it, the A.L.A.M. pool
F40 1310  6    was a haven from the infringement actions involving
F40 1320  3    detail patents that beset the industry with mounting
F40 1330  1    intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded
F40 1330 10    with cases, many of them brought by freebooters who
F40 1340  8    trafficked in disputed inventions. It was commonplace
F40 1350  4    for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers to find
F40 1360  3    warning notices and threats of infringement suits in
F40 1360 11    their daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint
F40 1370  9    and without regard to the lawyer's view", commented
F40 1380  7    a trade journal, "the matter of patents in the automobile
F40 1390  7    and accessory trade is developing some phases and results
F40 1400  5    that challenge thought as to how far patents are to
F40 1410  3    become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple
F40 1410 12    beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive
F40 1420  6    creation".
F40 1430  1       Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the
F40 1430  8    almost certain prospect of legal complications. One
F40 1440  6    manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said:
F40 1450  4    "I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture
F40 1460  2    of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would
F40 1460 15    enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent
F40 1470  8    litigation which would eat up all our profits". The
F40 1480  7    prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912
F40 1490  5    by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee:
F40 1500  1    "The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive
F40 1500  7    conditions, including delays surrounding legal disputes,
F40 1510  6    particularly in patent litigation, are items of industrial
F40 1520  6    burden which must be written large in figures of many
F40 1530  6    millions of dollars of industrial waste".
F40 1540  1       By that time it was commonly agreed that patent
F40 1540 10    warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking
F40 1550  5    the free exchange of technical information. At this
F40 1560  4    point Charles C. Hanch, long an advocate of patent
F40 1570  3    peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents
F40 1570 12    committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce,
F40 1580  8    successor to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was
F40 1590  9    treasurer of the Nordyke + Marmon Company, an Indianapolis
F40 1600  6    firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery
F40 1610  2    before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had first-hand
F40 1620  3    knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about
F40 1620 12    ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out
F40 1630  9    of business in the mid-1890's. Anxious to avoid a similar
F40 1640  6    debacle in the motor car industry, Hanch went to Detroit
F40 1650  5    in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members
F40 1660  3    for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan. The breach
F40 1670  3    created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but
F40 1670 12    Hanch did not abandon his scheme.
F40 1680  6       After the demise of the A.L.A.M., the time was propitious
F40 1690  5    for establishing such a pool. Most manufacturers were
F40 1700  4    now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange
F40 1710  2    of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to
F40 1720  1    let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are
F40 1720 11    concerned", said a trade authority, "than to continue
F40 1730  7    the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the
F40 1740  5    courts or seeking to reform the patent system, which
F40 1750  2    appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".
F40 1760  1       With the other members of the patents committee-
F40 1760  9    Wilfred C. Leland, Howard E. Coffin, Windsor T. White,
F40 1770  7    and W. H. Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing
F40 1780  6    agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing
F40 1790  6    was his own contribution. The plan was supported by
F40 1800  5    Frederick P. Fish, counsel for the National Automobile
F40 1810  2    Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his
F40 1820  1    summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough, Fish
F40 1820  9    had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the
F40 1830  9    American industrial community. He was well aware that
F40 1840  7    some inventors and their allies used their patents
F40 1850  3    solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that
F40 1860  1    not one patented invention in ten is worth making",
F40 1860 10    he later told a Congressional committee. The eloquent
F40 1870  6    persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the
F40 1880  5    plan by the members of the automotive trade association.
F40 1890  1       Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement
F40 1890  9    became effective in 1915. It remained in force for
F40 1900  9    ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals
F40 1910  6    since 1925.
