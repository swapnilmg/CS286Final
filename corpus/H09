H09 0020  1    of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
H09 0020 10    That the Act of July 3, 1952 (66 Stat. 328) as amended
H09 0030 11    (42 U.S.C. 1952-1958), is further amended to read as
H09 0040  9    follows:
H09 0050  1    _SECTION 1._
H09 0050  1       In view of the increasing shortage of usable surface
H09 0050 10    and ground water in many parts of the Nation and the
H09 0060  9    importance of finding new sources of supply to meet
H09 0070  5    its present and future water needs, it is the policy
H09 0080  1    of the Congress to provide for the development of practicable
H09 0080 11    low-cost means for the large-scale production of water
H09 0090  9    of a quality suitable for municipal, industrial, agricultural,
H09 0100  5    and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water,
H09 0110  5    and for studies and research related thereto. As used
H09 0120  4    in this Act, the term 'saline water' includes sea water,
H09 0130  2    brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically
H09 0130  9    charged water, and the term 'United States' extends
H09 0140  8    to and includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
H09 0150  6    of Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions
H09 0160  3    of the United States.

H09 0180  1    _(A)_
H09 0180  2       conduct, encourage, and promote fundamental scientific
H09 0190  2    research and basic studies to develop the best and
H09 0190 11    most economical processes and methods for converting
H09 0200  6    saline water into water suitable for beneficial consumptive
H09 0210  5    purposes;
H09 0210  6    _(B)_
H09 0210  7       conduct engineering research and technical development
H09 0220  5    work to determine, by laboratory and pilot plant testing,
H09 0230  5    the results of the research and studies aforesaid in
H09 0240  3    order to develop processes and plant designs to the
H09 0240 12    point where they can be demonstrated on a large and
H09 0250 10    practical scale;
H09 0260  1    _(C)_
H09 0260  1       recommend to the Congress from time to time authorization
H09 0260 10    for construction and operation, or for participation
H09 0270  7    in the construction and operation, of a demonstration
H09 0280  6    plant for any process which he determines, on the basis
H09 0290  4    of subsections (a) and (b) above, has great promise
H09 0300  3    of accomplishing the purposes of this Act, such recommendation
H09 0310  1    to be accompanied by a report on the size, location,
H09 0310 11    and cost of the proposed plant and the engineering
H09 0320  8    and economic details with respect thereto;
H09 0330  3    _(D)_
H09 0330  4       study methods for the recovery and marketing of
H09 0340  2    commercially valuable byproducts resulting from the
H09 0340  8    conversion of saline water; and
H09 0350  5    _(E)_
H09 0350  6       undertake economic studies and surveys to determine
H09 0360  3    present and prospective costs of producing water for
H09 0360 11    beneficial consumptive purposes in various parts of
H09 0370  7    the United States by the leading saline water processes
H09 0380  7    as compared with other standard methods.
H09 0390  2    _SEC. 3._
