D07 0010  1    "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall
D07 0010 11    I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom
D07 0020 11    shall I be afraid"? Psalm 27:1
D07 0040  3       A certain teacher scheduled a "Fear Party" for her
D07 0050  3    fourth grade pupils. It was a session at which all
D07 0050 13    the youngsters were told to express their fears, to
D07 0060  8    get them out in the open where they could talk about
D07 0070  6    them freely. The teacher thought it was so successful
D07 0080  3    that she asks: "Wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups
D07 0090  2    if they could participate in a similar confessional
D07 0090 10    of their fears and worries"?
D07 0100  4       Dr. George W. Crane, a medical columnist, thinks
D07 0110  3    it would. He says: "That would reduce neurotic ailments
D07 0120  2    tremendously. Each week an estimated 20 million patients
D07 0120 10    call upon us doctors. Of this number, 50%, or 10 million
D07 0130 11    patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.
D07 0140  6    They are 'worry warts'. Yet they keep running from
D07 0150  6    one physician to another, largely to get a willing
D07 0160  3    ear who will listen to their parade of troubles. One
D07 0160 13    of the most wholesome things you could schedule in
D07 0170  9    your church would thus be a group confessional where
D07 0180  6    people could admit of their inner tensions".
D07 0190  1       We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways
D07 0190 11    to deal with the problem of fear these days. It must
D07 0200 11    be getting more serious. People are giving their doctors
D07 0210  6    a hard time. One doctor made a careful survey of his
D07 0220  6    patients and the reasons for their troubles, and he
D07 0230  2    reported that 40% of them worried about things that
D07 0230 11    never happened; 30% of them worried about past happenings
D07 0240  8    which were completely beyond their control; 12% of
D07 0250  6    them worried about their health, although their ailments
D07 0260  4    were imaginary; 10% of them worried about their friends,
D07 0270  3    neighbors, and relatives, most of whom were quite capable
D07 0280  1    of taking care of themselves. Only 8% of the worries
D07 0280 11    had behind them real causes which demanded attention.
D07 0290  7       Well, most of our fears may be unfounded, but after
D07 0300  7    you discover that fact, you have something else to
D07 0310  3    worry about: Why then do we have these fears? What
D07 0320  1    is the real cause of them? What is there about us that
D07 0320 13    makes us so anxious?
D07 0330  2       Look at the things we do to escape our fears and
D07 0340  1    to forget our worries. We spend millions of dollars
D07 0340 10    every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers. We spend
D07 0350  6    billions of dollars at the race tracks, and more billions
D07 0360  5    on other forms of gambling. We spend billions of dollars
D07 0370  3    on liquor, and many more billions on various forms
D07 0370 12    of escapist entertainment. We consume tons of aspirin
D07 0380  8    and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get
D07 0390  8    a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing
D07 0400  4    us apart.
D07 0400  6       A visitor from a more peaceful country across the
D07 0410  4    sea was taken to one of our amusement parks, and after
D07 0420  1    he had seen it all, he said to a friend: "You must
D07 0420 13    be a very sad people". "Sad" was not the right word,
D07 0430  9    of course. He should have said "jittery", for that's
D07 0440  6    what we are. And that's worse than sad. Watch people
D07 0450  5    flock to amusement houses, cocktail lounges, and night
D07 0460  3    clubs that advertise continuous entertainment, which
D07 0460  9    means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid
D07 0470 10    entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible
D07 0480  6    ways which are designed to give men a few hours of
D07 0490  6    dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell that
D07 0500  2    many of them are running away from something.
D07 0500 10       In one of his writings Pascal speaks of this mania
D07 0510  8    for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which
D07 0520  6    man cannot endure without such opiates. Yes, and as
D07 0530  3    tension mounts in this world, fear is increasing. Does
D07 0530 12    that explain why there is now such a big boom in the
D07 0540 12    bomb shelter business? We have so many new things to
D07 0550  8    fear in this age of nuclear weapons, dreadful things
D07 0560  3    which are too horrible to contemplate. I doubt that
D07 0570  1    "fear parties" and "group confessionals" will help
D07 0570  8    very much. Suppose we do get our fears out in the open,
D07 0580 11    what then? Isn't that where most of them are already-
D07 0590  7    right out on the front page of our newspapers? Maybe
D07 0600  3    we are talking about them too much. The question is:
D07 0610  2    what are we going to do about them?
D07 0610 10       Meanwhile, the enemy will capitalize on our fears,
D07 0620  7    if he can. Hitler did just that 23 years ago, building
D07 0630  5    up tensions that first led to a Munich and then to
D07 0640  2    a world war. The fear of war can make us either too
D07 0640 14    weak to stand and too willing to compromise, or too
D07 0650  8    reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as
D07 0660  4    long as there is any chance to negotiate. It is said
D07 0670  2    that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes
D07 0670 12    animals to attack. It could have the same effect on
D07 0680 10    Communists. The President of the United States has
D07 0690  6    said: "We will never negotiate out of fear, and we
D07 0700  5    will never fear to negotiate". That is a sound position,
D07 0710  1    but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it
D07 0710 10    not merely as the word of a president but as the mind
D07 0720 11    of a free people who are not afraid. And that's another
D07 0730  5    reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer
D07 0740  4    our fears, to develop the poise that promotes peace.
D07 0750  1       Turning to the Word of God, we find the only sure
D07 0750 12    way to do that. In Psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful
D07 0760  9    words which you must have in your heart if you are
D07 0770  8    to master the fears that surround you, or to drive
D07 0780  4    them out if they have you in their grip: "The Lord
D07 0790  1    is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
D07 0790 12    Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
D07 0800 10    afraid"?
D07 0800 11       Well, you say, those are beautiful words all right,
D07 0810  9    but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his
D07 0820  7    day. He didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like
D07 0830  3    ours. He didn't know anything about the problems we
D07 0840  2    face today.
D07 0840  4       No? Read the next two verses: "When the wicked,
D07 0850  2    even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat
D07 0850 13    up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host
D07 0860  8    should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
D07 0870  5    though war should rise against me, in this will I be
D07 0880  3    confident".
D07 0880  4       That is almost a perfect description of the predicament
D07 0890  3    in which we find ourselves today, isn't it? Our enemy
D07 0900  2    is also threatening to devour us. He has already devoured
D07 0900 12    huge areas of the world, putting men behind concrete
D07 0910  9    walls and iron curtains and barbed wire, reducing them
D07 0920  6    to slavery, systematically crushing not only their
D07 0930  4    bodies but their souls, and shooting them to death
D07 0930 13    if they try to escape their prison. Yes indeed, we
D07 0940  9    too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against
D07 0950  6    us.
D07 0950  7       What a terrible thing, that "wailing wall" in Berlin!
D07 0960  5    A man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading
D07 0970  3    for his wife who is on the other side with the rest
D07 0980  1    of the family. Another man tried to swim across the
D07 0980 11    river from the East to the West, but was shot and killed.
D07 0990  9    A middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor
D07 1000  7    of her house which was behind the wall, she threw out
D07 1010  4    a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured.
D07 1020  1    The entrance to a church has been walled up, so that
D07 1020 12    the congregation, most of which is in the western sector,
D07 1030  9    cannot worship God there anymore. Practically everybody
D07 1040  4    in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the
D07 1050  5    opposite part of the city. People stand at the wall
D07 1060  1    giving vent to their feelings, weeping, pounding it
D07 1060  9    with their fists, pleading for loved ones. But the
D07 1070  7    enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out
D07 1080  4    Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible
D07 1090  1    profanity. There is only one escape left, a tragic
D07 1090 10    one, and too many people are taking it: suicide. The
D07 1100  8    normal rate of suicides in East Berlin was one a day,
D07 1110  7    but since the border was closed on August 13 it has
D07 1120  4    jumped to 25 a day!
D07 1120  9       These things may be happening many miles away from
D07 1130  5    us but really they are right next door. We are all
D07 1140  2    involved in them, deeply involved. And nobody knows
D07 1140 10    what comes next. We live from crisis to crisis. And
D07 1150  8    there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears
D07 1160  6    in such a world. He must learn to say with true faith
D07 1170  3    what the psalmist said in a similar world: "The Lord
D07 1180  1    is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
D07 1180 12    Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
D07 1190 10    afraid"?
D07 1200  1       Notice that this man had a threefold conception
D07 1210  8    of God which is the secret of his faith. First, "the
D07 1220  6    Lord is my light". He lived in a very dark world, but
D07 1230  5    he was not in the dark. The same God who called this
D07 1240  2    world into being when He said: "Let there be light"!-
D07 1250  3    those were His very first creative words- He began
D07 1250 12    the world with light- this God still gives light to
D07 1260  7    a world which man has plunged into darkness. For those
D07 1270  5    who put their trust in Him He still says every day
D07 1280  3    again: "Let there be light"! And there is light!
D07 1290  1       In fact, He came into this world Himself, in the
D07 1290 11    person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who stood here amid
D07 1300  9    the darkness of human sin and said: "I am the light
D07 1310  8    of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
D07 1320  6    darkness, but shall have the light of life". The psalmist
D07 1330  2    could say that God was his light even though he could
D07 1330 13    only anticipate the coming of Christ. He lived in the
D07 1340 10    dawn; he could only see the light coming over the horizon.
D07 1350  9    We live in the bright daylight of that great event;
D07 1360  5    for us it is a fact in history. Why should we not have
D07 1370  4    the same faith, and an even greater experience of the
D07 1370 14    light which it gives?
D07 1380  4       This is the faith that moved the psalmist to add
D07 1390  3    his second conception of God: "The Lord is ... my salvation".
D07 1400  1    He knew that his God would save him from his enemies
D07 1410  1    because He had saved him from his sins. If God could
D07 1410 12    do that, He could do anything. The enemies at his gate,
D07 1420  8    threatening to eat up his flesh, were nothing compared
D07 1430  5    with the enemy of sin within his own soul. And God
D07 1440  3    had conquered that one by His grace! So why worry about
D07 1450  1    all the others?
D07 1450  4       The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language
D07 1460  2    and faith of the New Testament: "He that spared not
D07 1470  1    His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
D07 1470 13    He not with Him freely give us all things? ... If God
D07 1480 10    be for us, who can be against us? ... Who shall separate
D07 1490  7    us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,
D07 1500  5    or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
D07 1510  3    or sword"? (Romans 8:31, 32, 35)
D07 1510  9       Salvation! This is the key to the conquest of fear.
D07 1520  5    This gets down to the heart of our problem, for it
D07 1530  2    reconciles us with God, whom we fear most of all because
D07 1530 13    we have sinned against Him. When that fear has been
D07 1540  9    removed by faith in Jesus Christ, when we know that
D07 1550  6    He is our Savior, that He has paid our debt with His
D07 1560  4    blood, that He has met the demands of God's justice
D07 1570  1    and thus has turned His wrath away- when we know that,
D07 1570 12    we have peace with God in our hearts; and then, with
D07 1580  9    this God on our side, we can face the whole world without
D07 1590  8    fear.
D07 1590  9       And so the psalmist gives us one more picture of
D07 1600  7    God: "The Lord is the strength of my life". The word
D07 1610  6    is really "stronghold". It recalls those words of another
D07 1620  4    psalm: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present
D07 1630  2    help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though
D07 1630 11    the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried
D07 1640  9    into the midst of the sea ... Come, behold the works
D07 1650  7    of the Lord, what desolations He hath made in the earth.
