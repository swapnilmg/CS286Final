K12 0010  1    She was a child too much a part of her environment,
K12 0010 12    too eager to grow and learn and experience. Once, they
K12 0020  7    were at Easthampton for the summer (again, Fritzie
K12 0030  3    said, a good place, even though they were being robbed).
K12 0040  1    One soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when
K12 0040 10    the sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume
K12 0050 10    and wrack haunts everything- Amy had picked herself
K12 0060  5    off the floor and begun to walk. Fritzie was on the
K12 0070  5    couch reading; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about
K12 0080  2    eight feet away. The infant, in white terry-cloth bathrobe,
K12 0090  1    her face intense and purposeful, had essayed a few
K12 0090 10    wobbly steps toward her father. "Y'all wanna walk-
K12 0100  6    walk", he said. Then, gently, he shoved her behind
K12 0110  5    toward Laura. Amy walked- making it halfway across
K12 0120  2    the cottage floor. She lost not a second, picking herself
K12 0120 12    up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura. Then Laura
K12 0130  9    took her gently and shoved her off again, toward Fritzie:
K12 0140  8    Amy did not laugh- this was work, concentration, achievement.
K12 0150  5    In a few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided;
K12 0160  6    soon she was parading around the house, flaunting her
K12 0170  3    new skill.
K12 0170  5       Some liar's logic, a wisp of optimism as fragile
K12 0180  3    as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through
K12 0180 12    the window (a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill
K12 0190  9    Fritzie had given her), consoled her for a moment.
K12 0200  7    Amy had to be safe, had to come back to them- if only
K12 0210  7    to reap that share of life's experiences that were
K12 0220  3    her due, if only to give her parents another chance
K12 0220 13    to do better by her. Through the swathings of terror,
K12 0230  9    she jabbed deceit's sharp point- Amy would be reborn,
K12 0240  7    a new child, with new parents, living under new circumstances.
K12 0250  5    The comfort was short-lived, yet she found herself
K12 0260  3    returning to the assurance whenever her imagination
K12 0260 10    forced images on her too awful to contemplate without
K12 0270  9    the prop of illusion. Gazing at her husband's drugged
K12 0280  1    body, his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms,
K12 0290  2    she saw the grandeur of his fictional world, that lush
K12 0300  1    garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs. She
K12 0300 10    envied him. She admired him.
K12 0310  3       In the darkness, she saw him stirring. He seemed
K12 0320  1    to be muttering, his voice surprisingly clear. "Y'all
K12 0320  9    should have let me take that money out", Andrus said.
K12 0330  9    "'Nother minute I'd have been fine. Y'all should have
K12 0340  3    let me do it".
K12 0340  7       Laura touched his hand. "Yes, I know, Fritzie. I
K12 0350  8    should have".
K12 0350 10    #TUESDAY#
K12 0360  1    The heat intensified on Tuesday. Southern California
K12 0360  8    gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell, drier,
K12 0370  9    more enervating, more laden with man's contrived impurities
K12 0380  6    than the worst days of the summer past. It could continue
K12 0390  5    this way, hitting 106 and more in the Valley, Joe McFeeley
K12 0400  3    knew, into October. He and Irvin Moll were sipping
K12 0410  1    coffee at the breakfast bar. Both had been up since
K12 0410 11    7:00- Irv on the early-morning watch, McFeeley unable
K12 0420  8    to sleep during his four-hour relief. The night before,
K12 0430  5    they had telephoned the Andrus maid, Selena Masters,
K12 0440  3    and she had arrived early, bursting her vigorous presence
K12 0450  2    into the silent house with an assurance that amused
K12 0450 11    McFeeley and confounded Moll. The latter, thanking
K12 0460  7    her for the coffee, had winked and muttered, "Sure
K12 0470  5    'nuff, honey". Selena was the wrong woman for these
K12 0480  4    crudities. With a hard eye, she informed Moll: "Don't
K12 0490  1    sure 'nuff me, officer. I'm honey only to my husband,
K12 0500  1    understand"? Sergeant Moll understood. The maid was
K12 0500  8    very black and very energetic, trim in a yellow pique
K12 0510 10    uniform. Her speech was barren of southernisms; she
K12 0520  6    was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities,
K12 0530  2    adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of
K12 0540  3    Los Angeles. Not seeing her dark intelligent face,
K12 0540 11    one would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood
K12 0550 11    Village matron, ten years out of Iowa. After she had
K12 0560  8    served the detectives coffee and toast (they politely
K12 0570  4    declined eggs, uncomfortable about their tenancy),
K12 0580  1    she settled down with a morning newspaper and began
K12 0580 10    reading the stock market quotations. While she was
K12 0590  6    thus engaged, McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts
K12 0600  5    the previous day, any recollections she had of people
K12 0610  4    hanging around, of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen,
K12 0620  1    of strange cars cruising the neighborhood. She answered
K12 0620  9    him precisely, missing not a beat in her scrutiny of
K12 0630  9    the financial reports. Selena Masters, Joe realized,
K12 0640  4    was her own woman. She was the only kind of Negro Laura
K12 0650  4    Andrus would want around: independent, unservile, probably
K12 0660  2    charging double what ordinary maids did for housework-
K12 0660 10    and doubly efficient.
K12 0670  3       When the parents emerged from the bedroom a few
K12 0680  3    minutes later, the maid greeted them quietly. "I'm
K12 0680 11    awful sorry about what's happened", Selena said. "Maybe
K12 0690  7    today'll be a good-news day". She charged off to the
K12 0700 10    bedrooms.
K12 0700 11       Moll took his coffee into the nursery. During the
K12 0710  6    night, a phone company technician had deadened the
K12 0720  4    bells and installed red blinkers on the phones. Someone
K12 0730  1    would have to remain in the office continually. McFeeley
K12 0730 10    greeted the parents, then studied his notebook. He
K12 0740  8    wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and
K12 0750  6    start her on the mug file.
K12 0750 12       "Sleep well"? he asked.
K12 0760  4       Andrus did not answer him. His face was bloated
K12 0770  2    with drugging, redder than normal. The woman had the
K12 0770 11    glassy look of an invalid, as if she had not slept
K12 0780 11    at all. "Oh- we managed", she said. "I'm a little groggy.
K12 0790  7    Did anything happen during the night"?
K12 0800  3       "Few crank calls", McFeeley said. "A couple of tips
K12 0810  4    we're running down- nothing promising. We can expect
K12 0820  2    more of the same. Too bad your number is in the directory".
K12 0830  1       "Didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when
K12 0830 11    I had it listed", Andrus muttered. He settled on the
K12 0840  9    sofa with his coffee, warming his hands on the cup,
K12 0850  7    although the room was heavy with heat.
K12 0860  1       The three had little to say to each other. The previous
K12 0860 12    night's horror- the absolute failure, overcast with
K12 0870  6    the intrusions of the press, had left them all with
K12 0880  8    a wan sense of uselessness, of play-acting. Sipping
K12 0890  2    their coffee, discussing the weather, the day's shopping,
K12 0900  1    Fritzie's commitments at the network (all of which
K12 0900  9    he would cancel), they avoided the radio, the morning
K12 0910  8    TV news show, even the front page of the Santa Luisa
K12 0920  8    Register, resting on the kitchen bar. KIDNAPER SPURNS
K12 0930  4    RANSOM; AMY STILL MISSING. Once, Andrus walked by it,
K12 0940  5    hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five-column
K12 0950  4    lead of the article (by Duane Bosch, staff correspondent-
K12 0960  3    age not given), and muttered: "We a buncha national
K12 0960 12    celebrities".
K12 0970  1       McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to
K12 0980  1    police headquarters in a half hour. Before that, he
K12 0980 10    wanted to talk to the neighbors. He did not want to
K12 0990  8    bring the Andruses to the station house too early-
K12 1000  4    Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference, and he
K12 1010  1    didn't want them subjected to the reporters again.
K12 1010  9    He could think of nothing else to tell them: no assurances,
K12 1020  9    no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day. When
K12 1030  5    the detective left, Andrus phoned his secretary to
K12 1040  3    cancel his work and to advise the network to get a
K12 1040 14    substitute director for his current project. Mrs. Andrus
K12 1050  8    was talking to the maid, arranging for her to come
K12 1060  7    in every day, instead of the four days she now worked.
K12 1070  4       Outside, only a handful of reporters remained. The
K12 1080  2    bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference.
K12 1090  1    In contrast to the caravan of the previous night, there
K12 1090 11    were only four cars parked across the street. Two men
K12 1100  9    he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching
K12 1110  5    sweet rolls. He did not see Sparling, or DeGroot, or
K12 1120  3    Ringel, or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed
K12 1130  1    him twelve hours ago. However, the litter remained,
K12 1130  9    augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers. The street
K12 1140  7    cleaner had not yet been around.
K12 1150  2       One of the reporters called to him: "Anything new,
K12 1160  1    Lieutenant"? And he ignored him, skirting the parked
K12 1160  9    cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house. When
K12 1170 10    McFeeley was halfway to the door, the proprietor emerged-
K12 1180  7    a mountainous, dark man, his head thick with resiny
K12 1190  5    black hair, his eyes like two of the black olives he
K12 1200  2    imported in boatloads. McFeeley identified himself.
K12 1200  8    The master of the house, his nourished face unrevealing,
K12 1210  8    consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to
K12 1220  7    talk to the detective.
K12 1220 11       Inside, as soon as Mr. Skopas had disclosed- in
K12 1230  9    a hoarse whisper- the detective's errand, his family
K12 1240  5    gathered in a huddle, forming a mass of dark flesh
K12 1250  4    on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side
K12 1250 15    of a baroque fireplace. Flanked by marble urns and
K12 1260  9    alabaster lamps, they seemed to be posing for a tribal
K12 1270  8    portrait.
K12 1270  9       It was amazing how they had herded together for
K12 1280  6    protection: an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk
K12 1290  4    wrapper, rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy
K12 1300  1    in his teens, shuffling in from the kitchen with a
K12 1300 11    sandwich in his hands; a girl in her twenties, fat
K12 1310  7    and sullen, descending the marble staircase; then all
K12 1320  3    four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.
K12 1330  1       They answered him in monosyllables, nods, occasionally
K12 1330  8    muttering in Greek to one another, awaiting the word
K12 1340  9    from Papa, who restlessly cracked his knuckles, anxious
K12 1350  5    to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst
K12 1360  3    off to the freeway. No, they hadn't seen anyone around;
K12 1370  1    no, they didn't know the Andrus family; yes, they had
K12 1370 11    read about the case; yes, they had let some reporters
K12 1380 10    use their phone, but they would no longer. They offered
K12 1390  8    no opinions, volunteered nothing, betrayed no emotions.
K12 1400  4    Studying them, McFeeley could not help make comparison
K12 1410  2    with the Andrus couple. The Skopas people seemed to
K12 1410 11    him of that breed of human beings whose insularity
K12 1420  9    frees them from tragedy. He imagined they were the
K12 1430  6    kind whose tax returns were never examined (if they
K12 1440  3    were, they were never penalized), whose children had
K12 1440 11    no unhappy romances, whose names never knew scandal.
K12 1450  8    The equation was simple: wealth brought them happiness,
K12 1470  5    and their united front to the world was their warning
K12 1480  4    that they meant to keep everything they had, let no
K12 1490  2    one in on the secrets. By comparison, Fritzie and Laura
K12 1490 12    Andrus were quivering fledglings. They possessed no
K12 1500  7    outer fortifications, no hard shells of confidence;
K12 1510  5    they had enough difficulty getting from day to day,
K12 1520  4    let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them. Skopas
K12 1530  1    expressed no curiosity over the case, offered no expression
K12 1530 10    of sympathy, made no move to escort McFeeley to the
K12 1540  9    door. All four remained impacted on the sofa until
K12 1550  6    he had left.
K12 1550  9       He had spoken to Mrs. Emerson the previous day.
K12 1560  5    There remained a family named Kahler, owners of a two-story
K12 1570  6    Tudor-style house on the south side of the Andrus home.
K12 1580  2    Their names had not come up in any discussions with
K12 1580 12    Laura, and he had no idea what they would be like.
K12 1590 11    McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens: each
K12 1600  5    blade of grass cropped, bright and firm; each shrub
K12 1610  3    glazed with good health.
K12 1610  7       The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties-
K12 1620  8    straight-backed, somewhat clerical in manner, wearing
K12 1630  4    rimless glasses. When Joe identified himself, he nodded,
K12 1640  2    unsmiling, and ushered him into a sedate living room.
K12 1640 11    Mrs. Kahler joined them. She had a dried-out quality-
K12 1650 10    a gray, lean woman, not unattractive. Both were dressed
K12 1660  6    rather formally. The man wore a vest and a tie, the
K12 1670  7    woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of
K12 1680  2    pearls.
K12 1680  3       "Funny thing", Mr. Kahler said, when they were seated,
K12 1690  3    "when I heard you ringing, I figured it was that guy
K12 1700  1    down the block, Hausman". McFeeley looked puzzled.
K12 1700  8    Kahler continued: "I fixed his dog the other day and
K12 1710  9    I guess he's sore, so I expected him to come barging
K12 1720  8    in". Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman's fox
K12 1730  4    terrier had been "making" in his flower beds. The dog
K12 1740  4    refused to be scared off, so Kahler had purchased some
K12 1750  1    small firecrackers. He would lay in wait in the garage,
K12 1750 11    and when the terrier came scratching around, he'd let
K12 1760  7    fly with a cherry bomb. "Scared the hell out of him",
K12 1770  6    Kahler grinned. "I hit him in the ass once". Both grinned
K12 1780  5    at the detective. "Finally, all I needed was to throw
K12 1790  4    a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker
K12 1800  1    and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life".
