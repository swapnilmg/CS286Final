P04 0010  1       "He must have forgiven me", Henrietta murmured to
P04 0010  9    the room. The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament
P04 0020  9    was proof enough of that; Doaty would never have left
P04 0030  8    her house to a godless woman.
P04 0040  1       She found herself wishing an old wish, that she
P04 0040 10    had told Doaty she was running away, that she had left
P04 0050  9    something more behind her than the loving, sorry note
P04 0060  6    and her best garnet pin. Perhaps Doaty had guessed
P04 0070  3    already and kept her counsel.
P04 0070  8       Henrietta thought, It's extraordinary how much she
P04 0080  5    always knew about both of us. There had been more to
P04 0090  5    know about Hetty, inevitably, and most of it unfavorable.
P04 0100  1    Adelia was the good one, or, if not always good, less
P04 0100 12    frequently tempted. Their childhood would have been
P04 0110  7    quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama,
P04 0120  5    especially through the long summers. In winter, in
P04 0130  3    the city, there had been the Maneret School, which
P04 0130 12    taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for
P04 0140  9    knowledge; there had been lessons in French from a
P04 0150  7    small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste
P04 0160  3    for his pupils; there had been the dancing class- Miss
P04 0170  4    Craddock, thin and tireless, with her supervising wand
P04 0170 12    and her everlasting one-two-three, one-two-three. There
P04 0180  9    had been supper parties and teas, fetes and little
P04 0190  7    balls, Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously
P04 0200  6    jocular, enormously possessive, the sun around which
P04 0210  2    the Blackwell planets revolved.
P04 0210  6       Mama had died before the corruption of the family
P04 0220  6    circle, the interruption of Charles. It was safe to
P04 0230  5    assume that Papa, sighing heavily, had said many times
P04 0240  1    to his remaining daughter, "Thank God your poor mother
P04 0240 10    was spared this", and indeed it might be true that
P04 0250  9    it had been easier for Henrietta to leave, with her
P04 0260  5    hand in Charles' hand, just because her "poor mother"
P04 0270  2    was gone already and would never know. Mama was vulnerable;
P04 0280  1    one had always felt the need to make a safe world around
P04 0280 13    her.
P04 0290  1       But I would have gone anyway, thought Henrietta.
P04 0290  9    She had always been able to ignore the moral question
P04 0300  8    because there had been no choice. Only at this moment-
P04 0310  6    perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying
P04 0320  4    in Doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others
P04 0330  1    might regard her. Perhaps they would argue that morality
P04 0330 10    consisted just of that ability to see a choice.
P04 0340  9       She turned on her side, finding the idea oppressive.
P04 0350  5    If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt
P04 0360  3    about Charles, would she have run away with him?
P04 0370  1       Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone.
P04 0370  9    No temptation, no sin.
P04 0380  3       No temptation, no virtue?
P04 0380  7       A curious thought to end a curious night. The birds
P04 0390  9    were really awake now in a colloquy of music, and light
P04 0400  6    was beginning to creep across the room, touching sill
P04 0410  3    and door, table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers
P04 0420  1    in their artificial blossom and leaf.
P04 0420  7       Before anything else, she would go to Doaty's grave
P04 0430  6    with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden. Everything
P04 0440  3    must wait upon this mission, this sentimental duty
P04 0450  1    of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards. She closed
P04 0450 10    her eyes, remembering the small French cemetery, enclosed
P04 0460  6    by stone walls. It had always seemed to rain there,
P04 0470  6    and even the grass was gray.
P04 0470 12       After the sad impatient moment, waiting for comfort
P04 0480  8    which could not come, she slipped out of bed and went
P04 0490  8    to the open window. The garden below was lacy with
P04 0500  4    dew and enchanting in its small wildness. Leaning out,
P04 0520  1    she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle,
P04 0520 10    one not quite come to bloom, one just beyond it. On
P04 0530  8    a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and
P04 0540  4    swelling pink buds, like a summer Valentine, a bird
P04 0550  1    balanced and sang, nondescriptly brown and alive with
P04 0550  9    its own music, a little engine of song.
P04 0560  6       It was so pretty and artless that she felt like
P04 0570  4    a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot
P04 0580  1    to play on the wet grass with all the growing things,
P04 0580 12    but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly
P04 0590  8    not a child but une femme d'un certain age. Feeling
P04 0600  5    suddenly neat and subdued, she dressed quite soberly
P04 0610  3    and went downstairs.
P04 0610  6       Rosa, unbelievably, was not yet up and about, reassurance
P04 0620  7    that Rosa was human. Feeling protective toward this
P04 0630  3    sleeping being, Henrietta found a yesterday bun and
P04 0640  1    milk in a white jug, a breakfast which was somewhat
P04 0640 11    the equivalent of going barefoot.
P04 0650  3       Outside, the garden, the tame wilderness, yielded
P04 0660  1    a patchwork bouquet of daisies, sweet william, scented
P04 0660  9    stock and lady's bedstraw, which she tied with long
P04 0670  7    grasses and took back to show Rosa, who was now stirring
P04 0680  6    about the kitchen and haranguing Folly. The poodle
P04 0690  3    came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers,
P04 0700  1    supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.
P04 0700  7       Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said
P04 0710  8    it was for Doaty. "Rummaging in the dew", said Rosa
P04 0720  5    coldly. "Go change your shoes before you turn around".
P04 0730  2    She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed
P04 0740  1    her under the clear impression that she could either
P04 0740 10    comply or stay home. Folly danced, eager for whatever
P04 0750  7    lay beyond the door.
P04 0750 11       To a Blackwell, there was only one church. The cemetery
P04 0760 10    slumbered just behind it, and the way lay through the
P04 0770  9    village and close to the sea. For the first time in
P04 0780  6    thirty years, Henrietta walked down the narrow street
P04 0790  2    with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants
P04 0790 11    eying her with the frankest curiosity. She smiled and
P04 0800  9    bowed, recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling
P04 0810  7    she had enjoyed when she was a child. Now, some of
P04 0820  4    the acknowledgments were cautious, but all were interested.
P04 0830  1       An old man, sitting against the wall of a cottage
P04 0830 11    and waiting for the sun to find him, gave her a more
P04 0840 12    than reflective look as she passed, the sap still plainly
P04 0850  8    rising in his branches. On an impulse, she turned back
P04 0860  4    and said good morning.
P04 0860  8       He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition,
P04 0870  8    announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the
P04 0880  6    first time. He then offered his own estimate of the
P04 0890  3    weather, which was unenthusiastic. "Summer's been slow
P04 0890 10    to come", he said. "It's my dryin' out time". He scowled
P04 0900 11    at her flowers.
P04 0910  2       "I'm taking them to the cemetery", said Henrietta,
P04 0920  1    out of a vague feeling of hospitality.
P04 0920  8       "They'll be takin' me next", he said pleasantly,
P04 0930  7    "but not so soon's they plan. See half of 'em in their
P04 0940  8    graves before I choose my own coffin. It's dryin' myself
P04 0950  4    out that does it". He regarded her with rising hope.
P04 0960  3    "You'd like to hear how I go about it".
P04 0970  1       "It's nice of you", Henrietta said doubtfully.
P04 0970  7       "Y're welcome". He straightened himself, soldierly
P04 0980  6    against the wall, and pulled his sprawled feet together
P04 0990  6    so they stood side by side in their old boots. His
P04 1000  4    stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and
P04 1000 16    became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects
P04 1010  8    of his text. "Every month, f'r three days", he said
P04 1030  7    happily, "I take no water into my system, no water
P04 1040  5    whatsoever. It rests the tissues".
P04 1040 10       Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how
P04 1050  8    it would, and he nodded approval of her womanly good
P04 1060  5    sense. "Rests the tissues", he said, "and pacifies
P04 1070  2    the system. My dad did it, and he lived to a great
P04 1070 14    age". He looked up at her sharply. "Don't remember,
P04 1080  9    do you"?
P04 1090  1       She did suddenly, through the link of memory with
P04 1090 10    his father, old Titus, who must have been in his nineties
P04 1100 10    when Henrietta ran away. Next to the Blackwells, Titus
P04 1110  6    had owned the island most, and she and Adelia had often
P04 1120  5    stood in front of him, silenced by his terrible years-
P04 1130  1    a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue
P04 1130 13    eyes like a mariner, more aged than possible. He had
P04 1140  9    never spoken once to the awed sisters, but his son
P04 1150  6    had been friendly, a big fellow of fifty or more, a
P04 1160  4    fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea. It
P04 1160 13    must be that son who sat before her now, shriveled
P04 1170  9    to half his size and half his senses.
P04 1180  3       She said gently, "Of course I remember you".
P04 1190  1       "Not so well's I remember you", he said. "Y're the
P04 1200  1    young Blackwell woman. Ran away on a black night with
P04 1200 11    a lawful wedded man. I know all about you".
P04 1210  7       "You do seem to", said Henrietta, impressed.
P04 1220  3       "Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife", he said
P04 1230  4    quite cheerfully. "Left mine many a time, only she
P04 1240  1    never knew it. Man in a boat, there's a lot of places
P04 1240 13    he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away
P04 1250 12    for a bit. Any harm in that"?
P04 1260  1       "Probably", said Henrietta dryly.
P04 1260  5       He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly.
P04 1270 10    "You'd be the one to say", he observed, and she found
P04 1280  8    herself liking his approval none too well, but she
P04 1290  5    could not defend herself and say that her actions were
P04 1300  2    "different", since all actions had their own laws.
P04 1300 10    Only, this old man's connivance was even less to her
P04 1310  9    taste than Selma Cotter's open censure. Well, she had
P04 1320  6    not come back to Great Island to be understood, praised
P04 1330  4    or condemned. She had come to make her peace with the
P04 1340  3    past, and of that past this ancient of the earth was
P04 1340 14    only a kind of shadow.
P04 1350  3       She started to move away, just as a woman came out
P04 1360  1    of the cottage, a big-boned, drab-haired figure with
P04 1360 11    a clean apron tied over her limp print dress. She smiled
P04 1370  9    vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man. "You've
P04 1380  7    not had your breakfast yet, gran'dad".
P04 1390  1       "Y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast", he said. "Milk
P04 1400  2    and sops"! He beat the air with his stick, and it fell
P04 1400 14    from his claws and clattered on the stones.
P04 1410  8       "He's owly today", his grand-daughter said wearily,
P04 1420  6    and bent to pick it up. "He's got this idea about drying
P04 1430  6    out ..."
P04 1430  8       "It ain't an idea"!
P04 1440  1       "If it ain't an idea", she said, "how comes it you
P04 1450  2    can drink beer but not water"?
P04 1450  8       He looked piously to heaven and said, "Beer don't
P04 1460  5    affect the tissues none", and the ingenious hypocrisy
P04 1470  2    of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave
P04 1480  1    him his stint of malevolence.
P04 1490  4       His grand-daughter sighed. "Come on, do. The children
P04 1500  5    are eating, and Miss Blackwell's on her way somewheres".
P04 1510  2       "To the graveyard. Who ain't"?
P04 1520  1       "Not me. I've got a day's work to do.- You'll be
P04 1520 12    visiting Miss Doaty, ma'am"?
P04 1530  4       Henrietta nodded. How much they knew about her!
P04 1540  4       The woman (she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty
P04 1550  2    and Delia had stood arm in arm, watching great age
P04 1550 12    grow small) answered the nod with her own. "God rest
P04 1560  9    her soul, she was a sweet one. Come on now". She put
P04 1570  7    a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him
P04 1580  5    up, patiently, with the gentle cruelty and necessary
P04 1590  1    tyranny that the young show toward the very old. He
P04 1590 11    mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the
P04 1600  9    house, shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak
P04 1610  5    and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those
P04 1620  2    who still had their wicked strength.
P04 1620  8       There was a gabble of voices from indoors, young
P04 1630  6    hungry sounds like cats after fish, and a burst of
P04 1640  4    swearing from the old man. Henrietta looked down at
P04 1640 13    her bouquet, still lively with its color and scent,
P04 1650  9    and set her feet on their journey's way again, leaving
P04 1660  5    the village street and crossing the first field, Folly
P04 1670  4    dancing ahead of her.
P04 1670  8       At the edge of the field, the wild rolling land
P04 1680  6    took over, dotted with fat round bushes like sheep.
P04 1690  2    They were covered with tiny white blossoms, their scant
P04 1690 11    roots clawing at the stony ground, and wild birds darted
P04 1700 10    in and about and through them so they were nearly alive
P04 1710  8    with the rustle and cry.
P04 1720  1       The air was full of sounds too but placid ones,
P04 1720 11    a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out
P04 1730  9    of the blue sky. She felt mindless, walking, and almost
P04 1740  4    easy until the church spire told her she was near the
P04 1750  2    cemetery, and she caught herself wondering what she
P04 1750 10    would say to Doaty.
P04 1760  2       Both church and graveyard were smaller than she
P04 1760 10    remembered them (how many things had lessened while
P04 1770  8    she was gone away) but the headstones had grown so
P04 1780  6    thick in thirty years that to find one named "Dorothy
P04 1790  2    Tredding" seemed suddenly impossible.
P04 1790  6       She sat down on the nearest, fallen with age and
P04 1800  9    gray with sea-damp, her fingers tracing the indecipherable
P04 1810  4    carved letters padded with green moss. The day's sun
P04 1820  4    was gathering its strength in gold, and she wished
P04 1830  1    she had brought her parasol, if only to shade Doaty's
P04 1830 11    flowers. A small, rock-carved angel watched her from
P04 1840  7    a nearby tomb, the only angel in the cemetery.
P04 1850  4       She remembered, suddenly, a night of savage moonlight
P04 1860  2    and scudding clouds when she and Adelia, having dared
P04 1860 11    each other, had stolen out of their great safe house
P04 1870 10    and come here, hand in hand, hoping and fearing ghosts.
