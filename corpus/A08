A08 0010  1       Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr., 41, as promotion
A08 0015  1    manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was
A08 0020  8    announced Saturday by John F. Tims, president of the
A08 0030  8    company.
A08 0030  9       Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke, who resigned.
A08 0040  5       The new promotion manager has been employed by the
A08 0050  6    company since January, 1946, as a commercial artist
A08 0060  2    in the advertising department.
A08 0060  6       He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen
A08 0070  5    Elementary school, Fortier High school and Soule business
A08 0090  1    college.
A08 0090  2       From June, 1942, until December, 1945, Pfaff served
A08 0100  4    in the Army Air Corps. While in the service he attended
A08 0110  3    radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill.
A08 0120  1       Before entering the service, Pfaff for five years
A08 0120  9    did clerical work with a general merchandising and
A08 0130  7    wholesale firm in New Orleans.
A08 0140  1       He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has
A08 0140 11    a daughter, Karol, 13. They reside at 4911 Miles dr.
A08 0160  1    _WASHINGTON_
A08 0160  1       - Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected
A08 0170  1    along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the
A08 0170  9    White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20.
A08 0180  9       Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day,
A08 0190  7    hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this
A08 0200  5    thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring
A08 0210  3    President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following
A08 0220  2    the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic
A08 0220 11    ceremonial route.
A08 0230  2       Pennsylvania Avenue, named for one of the original
A08 0240  1    13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street
A08 0240 10    in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint.
A08 0250  7    But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
A08 0260  5    #MANY BUILDINGS#
A08 0260  7    Within view of the avenue are some of the United States
A08 0270  8    government's tremendous buildings, plus shrines and
A08 0280  4    monuments. Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the White
A08 0290  2    House, is the most famous address of the free world.
A08 0300  1       Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania
A08 0300 10    Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue, begins
A08 0310  6    a series of great federal buildings, some a block long
A08 0320  6    and all about seven-stories high.
A08 0330  1       Great chapters of history have been recorded along
A08 0330  9    the avenue, now about 169 years old. In the early spring
A08 0340  9    of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to
A08 0350  5    watch 5000 women parade. They were the suffragettes
A08 0360  1    and they wanted to vote. In the 1920 presidential election
A08 0370  1    they had that right and many of them did vote for the
A08 0370 13    first time.
A08 0380  1    #SEATS ON SQUARE#
A08 0380  3    Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from
A08 0390  1    the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the
A08 0390 11    National Archives building where hundreds of thousands
A08 0400  6    of this country's most valuable records are kept. Also
A08 0410  5    the department of justice building is located where
A08 0420  3    J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of
A08 0430  1    investigation.
A08 0430  2       Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania,
A08 0440  1    powered with lines that are underground.
A08 0440  7       Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage
A08 0450  7    points bordering Lafayette Square, opposite the White
A08 0460  4    House. In this historic square are several statutes,
A08 0470  2    but the one that stands out over the others is that
A08 0470 13    of Gen. Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.
A08 0490  1       Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette
A08 0490  8    Square will be at least 40 marching units. About 16,000
A08 0500  9    military members of all branches of the armed forces
A08 0510  6    will take part in the parade.
A08 0510 12       Division one of the parade will be the service academies.
A08 0520 10    Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts
A08 0530  6    and Texas, the respective states of the President and
A08 0540  6    of Vice-President L. B. Johnson. Then will come nine
A08 0550  5    other states in the order of their admission to the
A08 0560  3    union.
A08 0560  4       Division three will be headed by the Marines followed
A08 0570  2    by 12 states; division four will be headed by the Navy,
A08 0580  1    followed by 11 states; division five, by the Air Force
A08 0580 11    followed by 11 states. Division six will be headed
A08 0590  8    by the Coast Guard, followed by the reserve forces
A08 0600  5    of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
A08 0610  2    Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories
A08 0610  9    and the Canal Zone.
A08 0630  1    _JACKSON, MISS._
A08 0630  3       - What does 1961 offer in political and governmental
A08 0640  1    developments in Mississippi?
A08 0640  4       Even for those who have been observing the political
A08 0650  5    scene a long time, no script from the past is worth
A08 0660  3    very much in gazing into the state's immediate political
A08 0670  1    future.
A08 0670  2       This is largely because of the unpredictability
A08 0670  9    of the man who operates the helm of the state government
A08 0680 10    and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants-
A08 0690  7    Gov. Ross Barnett.
A08 0700  1       Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience
A08 0700 10    in public administration, has surrounded himself with
A08 0710  6    confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but
A08 0720  6    his friends as well.
A08 0720 10       Consequently, it is uncertain after nearly 12 months
A08 0730  8    in office just which direction the Barnett administration
A08 0740  4    will take in the coming year.
A08 0740 10    #COULD BE SCRAMBLE#
A08 0750  3    Some predict the administration will settle down during
A08 0760  1    1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had
A08 0760 12    thus far.
A08 0770  1       The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus
A08 0770  9    far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others
A08 0780  7    who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at
A08 0790  4    some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's
A08 0800  1    office.
A08 0800  2       There are many who predict that should Barnett decide
A08 0810  1    to call the Legislature back into special session,
A08 0810  9    it will really throw his administration into a scramble.
A08 0820  7       Certainly nobody will predict that the next time
A08 0830  7    the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able
A08 0840  4    to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful
A08 0850  1    "honeymoon" he had in the 1960 legislative session.
A08 0850  9       If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961,
A08 0860  8    it will be the first year in the last decade that the
A08 0870  8    Legislature has not met in regular or special session.
A08 0880  3       The odds favor a special session, more than likely
A08 0890  2    early in the year.
A08 0890  6    #DISTRICTS ISSUE#
A08 0890  8    Legislators always get restless for a special session
A08 0900  6    (whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem
A08 0910  4    is not certain) and if they start agitating. Barnett
A08 0920  1    is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.
A08 0920 11       The issue which may make it necessary to have a
A08 0930  9    session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting
A08 0940  4    the state's congressional districts from six to five
A08 0950  3    to eliminate one congressional seat.
A08 0950  8       With eyes focused on the third congressional district,
A08 0960  6    the historic Delta district, and Congressman Frank
A08 0970  3    E. Smith as the one most likely to go, the redistricting
A08 0980  1    battle will put to a test the longstanding power which
A08 0980 11    lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature.
A08 0990  9       Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic
A08 1000  6    party will be at a crossroads during 1961, with the
A08 1010  5    first Democratic president in eight years in the White
A08 1020  4    House.
A08 1020  5       Split badly during the recent presidential election
A08 1030  2    into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists
A08 1030 10    and independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi
A08 1040  7    is currently a wreck. And there has been no effort
A08 1050  7    since the election to pull it back together.
A08 1060  1    #FUTURE CLOUDED#
A08 1060  3    Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic party,
A08 1070  2    apparently must make the move to reestablish relations
A08 1080  1    with the national Democratic party or see a movement
A08 1080 10    come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him
A08 1090  6    as a party functionary.
A08 1100  1       With a Democratic administration, party patronage
A08 1100  7    would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had
A08 1110  8    held its Democratic solidarity in the November election.
A08 1120  5       Now, the picture is clouded, and even US Sens.
A08 1130  3    James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis, who remained
A08 1140  2    loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.
A08 1150  1       Reports are that it is more than probability that
A08 1150  9    the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support
A08 1160  7    the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage
A08 1170  5    which flows to congressmen.
A08 1180  1    _BATON ROUGE, LA._
A08 1180  4       - The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears
A08 1190  2    to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's
A08 1200  1    theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
A08 1200 10       The year will probably start out with segregation
A08 1210  8    still the most troublesome issue. But it might give
A08 1220  6    way shortly to another vexing issue- that of finances
A08 1230  4    in state government.
A08 1230  7       The transition from segregation to finances might
A08 1240  4    already be in progress, in the form of an administration
A08 1250  1    proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent
A08 1250 12    to 3 per cent.
A08 1260  3       The administration has said the sales tax proposal
A08 1270  1    is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the
A08 1270 10    revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a
A08 1280  7    grant in aid program.
A08 1280 11       But the tardiness of the administration in making
A08 1290  7    the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the
A08 1300  5    tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage
A08 1310  2    of cash than to segregation.
A08 1310  7    #LEGISLATORS WEARY#
A08 1310  9    Indeed, the administration's curious position on the
A08 1320  7    sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its
A08 1330  8    defeat. The administration could not say why $28 million
A08 1340  6    was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
A08 1350  1       The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up
A08 1350  9    some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales
A08 1360  5    tax bill may play a part in determining whether it
A08 1370  3    can muster the required two-thirds vote.
A08 1370 10       The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday
A08 1380  9    in the House when the Legislature reconvenes.
A08 1390  4       Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect
A08 1400  4    a transition from special sessions of the Legislature
A08 1410  1    to normalcy.
A08 1410  3       If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and
A08 1420  1    say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts
A08 1420 11    to prevent integration. He could terminate special
A08 1430  6    sessions of the Legislature.
A08 1435  1       Actually, Davis would have to toss in the towel
A08 1440  9    soon anyway. Many legislators are already weary and
A08 1450  7    frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token
A08 1460  5    integration.
A08 1460  6       This is not the sort of thing most politicos would
A08 1470  6    care to acknowledge publicly. They would like to convey
A08 1480  4    the notion something is being done, even though it
A08 1480 13    is something they know to be ineffectual.
A08 1490  7    #UNDERLYING CONCERN#
A08 1490  9    Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis
A08 1500 10    the means to effect a transition. He could tell the
A08 1510  7    Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry
A08 1520  5    on the battle.
A08 1520  8       Then he could tell them to go home, while the administration
A08 1530  6    continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in
A08 1540  5    extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in
A08 1550  1    over an eight months period.
A08 1550  6       It is difficult to be certain how the administration
A08 1560  3    views that $28 million, since the views of one leader
A08 1570  1    may not be the same as the views of another one.
A08 1570 12       But if the administration should find it does not
A08 1580  8    need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program, a
A08 1590  6    not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek a
A08 1600  2    way to use the money for other purposes.
A08 1600 10       This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying
A08 1610  6    concern in the administration- the shortage of cash.
A08 1620  7    It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal
A08 1630  2    year.
A08 1630  3       If the administration does not succeed in passing
A08 1640  1    the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could
A08 1640 12    very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session
A08 1650  8    of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.
A08 1660  2       Since the constitution forbids introduction of a
A08 1670  3    tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will
A08 1670 12    either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates
A08 1680  9    of anticipated revenues.
A08 1690  1    #CONSTANT PROBLEM#
A08 1690  3    In either case, it could call a special session of
A08 1700  2    the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab
A08 1700 11    at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
A08 1710  7       The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant
A08 1720  6    one for any governor. It is one that most try to avoid,
A08 1730  6    as long as they can see an alternative approach to
A08 1740  2    the problem.
A08 1740  4       But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked
A08 1750  1    off, it can be expected the Davis administration will
A08 1750 10    take steps to trim spending at the spring session of
A08 1760  9    the state Legislature.
A08 1770  1       This might be done to arouse those who have been
A08 1770 11    squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the
A08 1780  8    Legislature, so it would be more receptive to a tax
A08 1790  5    proposal later in the year.
A08 1790 10       A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals
A08 1800  6    for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he
A08 1810  6    has not tried to economize.
A08 1810 11       Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some
A08 1820  7    of his followers have been using their administration
A08 1830  3    affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
A08 1840  1       The new year might see some house-cleaning, either
A08 1840 10    genuine or token, depending upon developments, to give
A08 1850  7    Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
