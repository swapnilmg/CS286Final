J55 0010  1    Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few
J55 0010 11    days earlier and, when he could not show the hide,
J55 0020  8    arrested him. Thinking the evidence insufficient to
J55 0030  3    get a conviction, he later released him. Even while
J55 0030 12    suffering the trip to his home, Cook swore to Moore
J55 0040 10    and Lane that he would kill the Indian.
J55 0050  5       Three weeks later following his recovery, armed
J55 0060  2    with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits
J55 0060 12    prepared by the district attorney, Cook and Russell
J55 0070  8    rode to arrest Martinez. Arriving at daybreak, they
J55 0080  5    found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender.
J55 0090  4    Instead, he whirled and ran to his house for a gun
J55 0100  3    forcing them to kill him, Cook reported.
J55 0100 10       Both Cook's and Russell's lives were threatened
J55 0110  6    by the Mexicans following the killing, but the company
J55 0120  5    officers felt that in the end, it would serve to quiet
J55 0130  3    them despite their immediate emotion. General manager
J55 0130 10    Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the
J55 0140 11    Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers
J55 0150  6    to sell out and move away, and try to have a few punished.
J55 0160  6       On February 17, Russell and Cook were sent to the
J55 0170  5    Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting
J55 0180  1    out ranches the company had purchased. While talking
J55 0180  9    with Julian M. Beall, Francisco Archuleta and Juan
J55 0190  7    Marcus appeared, both heavily armed, and after watching
J55 0200  6    the house for a while, rode away. It was nearly sundown
J55 0210  5    before they finished the business with Beall and began
J55 0220  2    riding down the stream. They had traveled only a short
J55 0220 12    distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along
J55 0230  8    a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them.
J55 0240  7    Suspecting an ambush, the two deputies decided to ride
J55 0250  4    up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill.
J55 0260  1       After spending two nights (Wednesday and Thursday)
J55 0260  8    in Catskill, the deputies again headed for the Vermejo
J55 0270  8    to finish their business. They stayed with a rancher
J55 0280  6    Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning
J55 0290  3    passed the old Garnett Lee ranch. Half a mile below
J55 0300  1    at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that
J55 0300 12    the company had purchased from A. J. Armstrong, occupied
J55 0310  8    by a Mexican, his wife, and an old trapper. There were
J55 0320  9    three houses in Salyer's Canyon just at the foot of
J55 0330  7    a low bluff, the road winding along the top, entering
J55 0340  2    above, and then passing down in front of the houses,
J55 0340 12    thence to the Vermejo. To the west of this road was
J55 0350 11    another low bluff, forty or fifty feet high, covered
J55 0360  6    with scrub oak and other brush. As they were riding
J55 0370  3    along this winding road on the bench of land between
J55 0370 13    the two bluffs, a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed
J55 0380 10    around the two officers. Not a bullet touched Cook
J55 0390  6    who was nearer the ambush, but one hit Russell in the
J55 0400  5    leg and another broke his arm, passing on through his
J55 0410  2    body.
J55 0410  3       With the first reports, Russell's horse wheeled
J55 0420  1    to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook,
J55 0420 11    followed by a hail of bullets, raced towards the arroyo
J55 0430  8    of Salyer's Canyon immediately in front of him, just
J55 0440  6    reaching it as his horse fell. Grabbing his Winchester
J55 0450  3    from its sheath, Cook prepared to fight from behind
J55 0460  1    the arroyo bank. Bullets were so thick, throwing sand
J55 0460 10    in his face, that he found it difficult to return the
J55 0470  8    fire. Noticing Russell's horse in front of the long
J55 0480  6    log building, he assumed his friend had slipped inside
J55 0490  2    and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began
J55 0490 15    working his way down the ditch to join him. At a very
J55 0500 12    shallow place, two Mexicans rushed into the open for
J55 0510  6    a shot. Dropping to one knee, Cook felled one, and
J55 0520  4    the other struggled off with his comrade, sending no
J55 0520 13    further fire in his direction. Just before leaving
J55 0530  8    the arroyo where he was partially concealed, he did
J55 0540  6    hear shots down at the house.
J55 0550  1       Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised,
J55 0550  9    dismounted, but just as the old trapper opened the
J55 0560  7    door to receive him, he fell into the trapper's arms-
J55 0570  1    dead. A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding
J55 0580  1    in a little chicken house had passed through his head,
J55 0580 11    tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side.
J55 0590  8    Finding him dead, Cook caught Russell's horse and rode
J55 0600  5    to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident
J55 0610  3    and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.
J55 0620  1       Before daylight Sunday morning, a posse of twenty-three
J55 0620 10    men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson
J55 0630  8    of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco
J55 0640  8    Chaves, where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered. MacPherson
J55 0650  5    boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded
J55 0660  5    entrance. The men inside informed him that they had
J55 0670  2    some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed
J55 0670 13    to see them even though he offered medical aid. The
J55 0680  9    officer demanded the names of the injured men; the
J55 0690  6    Mexicans not only refused to give them, but told the
J55 0700  4    possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it.
J55 0700 14    Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated,
J55 0710  9    too small a posse had been collected, and since the
J55 0720  7    deputy had not been provided with search warrants,
J55 0730  3    MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to
J55 0740  1    withdraw.
J55 0740  2       The posse's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be
J55 0750  2    overbearing and impudent. During the following week,
J55 0750  9    six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned;
J55 0760  7    some buildings, farm tools, two horses, plows, and
J55 0770  5    hay owned by Bonito Lavato, a friendly interpreter
J55 0780  1    for the company, and Pedro Chavez' hay were stolen
J55 0780 10    or destroyed; and a store was broken into and robbed.
J55 0790  9    District Attorney M. W. Mills warned that he would
J55 0800  7    vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these
J55 0810  3    crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch anyone.
J55 0820  2       Increasing threats on his life finally convinced
J55 0820  9    Cook that he should leave New Mexico. His friends advised
J55 0830 10    that it would be only a question of time until either
J55 0840  9    the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be
J55 0850  6    compelled to kill them in self-defense, perpetuating
J55 0860  1    the troubles. By early summer, he wrote from Laramie
J55 0860 10    that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the
J55 0870  9    ambush and was in a bad way financially, so Pels sent
J55 0880  6    him a draft for $100, warning that it was still not
J55 0890  4    wise for him to return. Pels also sent a check for
J55 0890 15    $100 to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument
J55 0900 10    erected on his grave.
J55 0910  2       Cattle stealing and killing, again serious during
J55 0910  9    the spring of 1891, placed the land grant company officers
J55 0920 10    in a perplexing position. They were reluctant to appoint
J55 0930  7    sheriffs to protect the property, thus running the
J55 0940  4    risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo,
J55 0950  3    and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary
J55 0960  1    for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of
J55 0960 10    being shot. And the law virtually ignored the situation.
J55 0970  7    The judge became ill just as the Colfax District Court
J55 0980  5    convened, no substitute was brought in, no criminal
J55 1000  3    cases heard, only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were
J55 1000 13    tried, and court adjourned sine die after sitting a
J55 1010  9    few days instead of the usual three weeks. Pels complained:
J55 1020  5    "Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and
J55 1030  6    inconvenience of going long distances to transact business;
J55 1040  2    public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished,
J55 1050  1    and the whole distribution of justice in this county
J55 1050 10    seems to be an absolute farce".
J55 1060  5       Word reached the company that the man behind these
J55 1070  3    depredations was Manuel Gonzales, a man with many followers,
J55 1080  1    including a number who were kept in line through fear
J55 1080 11    of him. Although wanted by the sheriff for killing
J55 1090  8    an old man named Asher Jones, the warrant for his arrest
J55 1100  6    had never been served. On May 19, a deputy sheriff's
J55 1110  3    posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five
J55 1120  1    miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan
J55 1120 11    Jose Martinez. By 3:00 A.M. they reached his house
J55 1130  9    and found it vacant. When they were refused entrance
J55 1140  6    to his brother's house nearby, they smashed down the
J55 1150  5    door, broke the window, and threw lighted clothes wet
J55 1160  2    with kerosene into the room. Still there was no Gonzales
J55 1160 12    and the family would say nothing.
J55 1170  6       About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican
J55 1180  5    houses containing six rooms in the form of a square.
J55 1190  2    While prowling around these buildings, two of the posse
J55 1190 11    recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people
J55 1200  9    inside. He was promised that no harm would befall him
J55 1210  7    if he would come out, but he cursed and replied that
J55 1220  4    he would shoot any man coming near the door. The posse
J55 1230  2    then asked that he send out the women and children
J55 1230 12    as the building would be fired or torn down over his
J55 1240  9    head if necessary to take him dead or alive. Again
J55 1250  5    he refused. In deadly earnest, the besiegers methodically
J55 1260  1    stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted
J55 1260 10    rags inside, only to have most stamped out by the women
J55 1270 11    as soon as they hit the floor. When it became obvious
J55 1280  7    that he could stay inside no longer, taking a thousand
J55 1290  4    to one chance Gonzales rushed outside, square against
J55 1300  1    the muzzle of a Winchester. Shot near the heart, he
J55 1300 11    turned to one side and plunged for a door to another
J55 1310 10    room several feet away, three bullets following him.
J55 1320  4    As he pushed open the door he fell on his face, one
J55 1330  3    of his comrades pulling him inside.
J55 1330  9       Not realizing the seriousness of the wound, the
J55 1340  6    besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house
J55 1350  3    would be burned down around him. Receiving no answer,
J55 1360  1    they set the fire. When the house was about half consumed,
J55 1360 12    his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands,
J55 1370 10    declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts
J55 1380  7    of Manuel. Finding it true that he was not inside,
J55 1390  4    the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes
J55 1400  1    through the side and the roof until they could see
J55 1400 11    a body on the bed covered by a blanket. Several slugs
J55 1410  7    fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal
J55 1420  5    an apparently lifeless hand. Shot six or eight times
J55 1430  2    the body was draped with Russell's pistol, belt, and
J55 1430 11    cartridges. There was no extra horse so it was left
J55 1440 10    to his comrades who, though numbering in the fifties,
J55 1450  5    had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing
J55 1460  3    a shot during the entire attack.
J55 1460  9       Early the next morning, a Mexican telephoned Pels
J55 1470  6    that Celso Chavez, one of the posse members, was surrounded
J55 1480  5    by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper Vermejo.
J55 1490  5    The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore
J55 1500  1    out a number of warrants against men who had been riding
J55 1500 12    about armed, according to signed statements by Chavez
J55 1510  7    and Dr. I. P. George, and ordered Deputy Barney Clark
J55 1520  6    of Raton to rescue the posseman. Traveling all night,
J55 1530  4    Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock
J55 1540  2    May 22. Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and
J55 1540 11    a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills, disappearing
J55 1550 10    at the posse's approach. A Mexican justice of the peace
J55 1560  8    had issue a writ against Chavez for taking part in
J55 1570  6    the "murder" of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father
J55 1580  6    were anxious to be taken out of danger. The men helped
J55 1590  2    them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton
J55 1590 11    along with three other families desiring to leave.
J55 1600  8       The ten or more dangerous parties singled out for
J55 1610  6    prosecution were still at large, and Pels realized
J55 1620  3    that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe
J55 1630  1    houses, defending themselves through loopholes, it
J55 1630  7    would be most difficult to capture them. Thus he wired
J55 1640  7    J. P. Lower and Sons of Denver: "Have you any percussion
J55 1650  6    hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well
J55 1660  6    loaded with balls or shrapnel shot? If not, how long
J55 1670  3    to order and what is the price"? He wisely decided
J55 1670 13    that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during
J55 1680 10    the coming roundup, particularly since the Mexicans
J55 1690  5    were on their guard. His problem then became one of
J55 1700  5    restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean
J55 1710  1    out the Vermejo by force immediately.
