B06 0010  1       The study of the St. Louis area's economic prospects
B06 0010 10    prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference
B06 0020  7    confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan
B06 0030  8    St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture
B06 0040  8    of the Missouri-Illinois countryside.
B06 0050  2       St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing
B06 0060  1    and in some places stagnant mid-continent region. Slackened
B06 0070  1    regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects
B06 0070 10    the region's relative lack of purchasing power. Not
B06 0080  7    all St. Louis industries, of course, have a market
B06 0090  6    area confined to the immediate neighborhood. But for
B06 0100  3    those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding
B06 0110  1    effect on the metropolitan core. The city has a stake
B06 0110 11    in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout
B06 0120  6    outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois.
B06 0130  2       Gov. Dalton's new Commerce and Industry Commission
B06 0140  2    is moving to create a nine-state regional group in
B06 0140 12    a collective effort to attract new industry. That is
B06 0150  8    one approach. Another would be to take the advice of
B06 0160  8    Dr. Elmer Ellis, president of the University of Missouri,
B06 0170  5    and provide for an impartial professional analysis
B06 0180  2    of Missouri's economy. He says the state, in order
B06 0180 11    to proceed with economic development, must develop
B06 0190  7    an understanding of how the various parts of its economy
B06 0200  7    fit together and dovetail into the national economy.

B06 0210  4       The research center of the University's School of
B06 0220  3    Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake
B06 0230  1    the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about. He and
B06 0230 11    Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined
B06 0240  9    the project at a recent conference. The University
B06 0250  6    can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic
B06 0260  5    development through such a study.
B06 0270  1       In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of
B06 0270  9    help to economically depressed areas ought to provide
B06 0280  6    some stimulus to growth. The Carbondale Industrial
B06 0290  2    Development Corp. has obtained a $500,000 loan to help
B06 0300  3    defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory
B06 0300 12    to accommodate production that will provide 500 new
B06 0310  7    jobs. Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West
B06 0320  1    Frankfort labor market, where unemployment has been
B06 0330  3    substantially higher than the national average. The
B06 0330 10    Federal program eventually should have a favorable
B06 0340  7    impact on Missouri's depressed areas, and in the long
B06 0350  6    run that will benefit St. Louis as well. @
B06 0360  1       Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents
B06 0370  1    another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.
B06 0370  9    More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county
B06 0380  8    than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area.
B06 0390  7    The unstable political situation there represents one
B06 0400  4    reason new plants shy away from the East Side.
B06 0410  1       And then there is St. Louis county, where the Democratic
B06 0420  1    leadership has shown little appreciation of the need
B06 0420  9    for sound zoning, of the important relationship between
B06 0430  6    proper land use and economic growth. St. Louis county
B06 0440  5    under its present leadership also has largely closed
B06 0450  3    its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted
B06 0460  1    parochial interests to take priority over area-wide
B06 0460  9    interests. Some plant-location specialists take these
B06 0470  6    signs to mean St. Louis county doesn't want industry,
B06 0480  5    and so they avoid the area, and more jobs are lost.
B06 0490  4       Metropolitan St. Louis's relatively slow rate of
B06 0500  3    growth ought to be a priority concern of the political,
B06 0500 13    business, civic and other leaders on both sides of
B06 0510  9    the Mississippi. Without a great acceleration in the
B06 0520  6    metropolitan area's economy, there will not be sufficient
B06 0530  4    jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St.
B06 0540  1    Louis will slip into second-class status.
B06 0540  8    #AN EXCESS OF ZEAL#
B06 0550  1    Many of our very best friends are reformers. Still
B06 0550 10    we must confess that sometimes some of them go too
B06 0560  8    far. Take, for example, the reformers among New York
B06 0570  4    City's Democrats. Having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the
B06 0580  4    primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall,
B06 0590  1    they have changed the name to Chatham Hall. Even though
B06 0590 11    headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham
B06 0600  8    building, do they believe that they can make the new
B06 0610  7    name stick?
B06 0610  9       Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger
B06 0620  6    often were regarded as badges of political shame, the
B06 0630  3    sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their
B06 0640  2    credit. But it is tradition rather than the record
B06 0640 11    which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name. After
B06 0650  9    all, it goes back to the days in which sedition was
B06 0660  6    not un-American, the days in which the Sons of St.
B06 0670  3    Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force
B06 0680  1    and violence- the British government that is.
B06 0680  8       Further, do our reforming friends really believe
B06 0690  6    that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment
B06 0700  4    of the tiger from their zoo? They will- when they give
B06 0710  2    up the donkey and the elephant. Instead of attempting
B06 0710 11    the impossible, why not a publicity campaign to prove
B06 0720  8    that all the tiger's stripes are not black? That might
B06 0730  7    go over.
B06 0730  9    #THE FAGET CASE#
B06 0730 12    The White House itself has taken steps to remove a
B06 0740 10    former Batista official, Col. Mariano Faget, from his
B06 0750  3    preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees
B06 0760  4    for the Immigration Service.
B06 0760  8       The Faget appointment was preposterous on several
B06 0770  7    grounds. The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro
B06 0780  6    Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates
B06 0790  6    of Dictator Batista. Using a Batista man to screen
B06 0800  4    refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the
B06 0800 11    democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose
B06 0810  7    Castro.
B06 0810  8       Moreover, Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too
B06 0820  8    outdated to be useful in "screening" Castro agents;
B06 0830  6    the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican
B06 0840  6    dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power. And while
B06 0850  4    he had headed Batista's anti-Communist section, the
B06 0860  2    Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much
B06 0860 11    as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists.
B06 0865  8       Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with
B06 0880  7    Gen. J. M. swing, an Eisenhower appointee as head of
B06 0890  6    the Immigration Service. Gen. Swing has received public
B06 0900  4    attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives
B06 0910  2    of his office. His official term expired last summer.
B06 0920  1    Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement
B06 0920 10    by his friend, Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania,
B06 0930  5    at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently
B06 0940  4    searching for all the House votes it could get.
B06 0950  3       Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration
B06 0960  1    matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.
B06 0960 11    At that point the Administration will have little reason
B06 0970  8    to hang onto Gen. Swing. The Faget case was the kind
B06 0980  8    of salvage job the Administration should not have to
B06 0990  5    repeat.
B06 0990  6    #MR. EISENHOWER, POLITICIAN#
B06 0990  9    As President, Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a
B06 1000  8    role aloof from the strife of partisan politics. As
B06 1010  7    a former President, however, Mr. Eisenhower abandoned
B06 1020  3    this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New
B06 1030  3    York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.
B06 1030 11       Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard
B06 1040 10    lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the
B06 1050 11    entire Corps as a "juvenile experiment" and to suggest
B06 1060  6    sending a Corps member to the moon. This was juvenile
B06 1070  5    ridicule. Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious
B06 1080  3    purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad.
B06 1080 12    His words were the more ungracious to come from a man
B06 1090 11    who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships
B06 1100  6    dedicated to the same goal of international understanding.
B06 1110  4       The former President blithely ignored recent history
B06 1120  4    in speaking of "dollarette" dollars under Kennedy Administration
B06 1130  3    fiscal policies. It was the Eisenhower Administration
B06 1140  1    which produced the largest peacetime deficit.
B06 1140  7       Finally, Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion
B06 1150  7    in Washington. This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin
B06 1160  7    crisis, when President Eisenhower first told reporters
B06 1170  4    that Berlin could not be defended with conventional
B06 1180  1    weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out
B06 1180 11    of the picture too. The crisis has been renewed since
B06 1190  9    then but the confusion has hardly been compounded.
B06 1200  5       Ex-Presidents, relieved of accountability for policy,
B06 1210  3    sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their
B06 1220  3    words. Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff
B06 1230  1    discourses have been in that vein. Nobody can deny
B06 1230 10    the right of former Chief Executives to take part in
B06 1240  7    politics, but the American people expect them always
B06 1250  4    to remember the obligations of national leadership
B06 1260  1    and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility.
B06 1260 10    This is a matter of respect for the Presidency. Mr.
B06 1270  7    Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect
B06 1280  5    for that or for his elder statesmanship.
B06 1290  1    #QUEEN OF THE SEAS#
B06 1290  5    The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed, luxury,
B06 1300  3    and impeccable British service on the high seas. Reports
B06 1310  1    that the venerable liner, which has been in service
B06 1310 10    since 1936, was to be retired struck a nostalgic note
B06 1320  8    in many of us. But the Cunard line, influenced by unpleasant
B06 1330  5    economic facts and not sentiment, has decided to keep
B06 1340  4    the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.
B06 1350  1       A new queen, with the prosaic title of Q3, had
B06 1350 11    been planned for several years to replace the Queen
B06 1360  8    Mary. The British government, concerned about the threat
B06 1370  5    of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry, had put
B06 1380  4    through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling
B06 1390  1    $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton
B06 1390 11    passenger liner.
B06 1400  2       Since 1957, more and more trans-Atlantic passengers
B06 1410  1    have been crossing by air. Economy class fares and
B06 1410 10    charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers
B06 1420  7    to the airlines. Competition from other steamship lines
B06 1430  5    has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third
B06 1440  4    to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked
B06 1450  1    drop of profits on the Atlantic run.
B06 1450  8       The Cunard line has under consideration replacing
B06 1460  4    the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons.
B06 1470  3    This would be cheaper to operate and could be used
B06 1470 13    for cruises during the lean winter months. Also under
B06 1480  9    consideration is an increased investment in Cunard
B06 1490  6    Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York.
B06 1500  4       The decline of the Cunard line from its position
B06 1510  1    of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development
B06 1520  1    in the history of transportation.
B06 1520  6    #MISSION TO VIET NAM#
B06 1520 10    Gen. Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is
B06 1530  8    "very much encouraged" about the chances of the pro-Western
B06 1540  8    government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla
B06 1550  5    attacks comes close to an announcement that he will
B06 1560  4    not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster
B06 1570  2    the Vietnamese Army. Gen. Taylor will report to President
B06 1580  1    Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to
B06 1580 13    South Viet Nam and, judging from some of his remarks
B06 1590  9    to reporters in the Far East, he is likely to urge
B06 1600  6    a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military,
B06 1610  2    economic, political and other resources.
B06 1610  7       There was good reason for Gen. Taylor to make an
B06 1620  9    inspection trip at this time. Communist guerrillas
B06 1630  3    recently have been reported increasing their activities
B06 1640  2    and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed
B06 1640 12    a new crisis. South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next
B06 1650 10    year- more than 300,000 tons- may have been destroyed.
B06 1660  7    The Viet Cong, the Communist rebels, may have lost
B06 1670  5    their stored grain and arms factories. The rebels may
B06 1680  3    try to seize what is left of the October harvest when
B06 1680 14    the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.
B06 1690  9       Nothing that is likely to happen, however, should
B06 1700  7    prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other
B06 1710  5    than instructional missions. The Indochina struggle
B06 1720  2    was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen. Ridgway
B06 1730  1    estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions
B06 1740 11    at the outset to win a war the French were losing.
B06 1750  7    It is a war to stay out of today, especially in view
B06 1760  3    of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently
B06 1770  1    does not want United States troops. He may want additional
B06 1770 11    technical help, and this should be forthcoming. South
B06 1780  8    Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States
B06 1790  5    aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been
B06 1800  3    stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's
B06 1810  1    visit last May.
B06 1810  4       Gen. Taylor, the President's special military adviser,
B06 1820  4    is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb
B06 1830  3    to propaganda or pressure. It is probable that his
B06 1830 12    recommendations will be informed and workable, and
B06 1840  7    that they will not lead to involving the United States
B06 1850  5    in an Asian morass.
B06 1860  1       Gov. John M. Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man
B06 1860 11    of long service in government, spoke with rich background
B06 1870  8    and experience when he said in an address here that
B06 1880  8    lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General
B06 1890  3    Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals and
B06 1900  2    corporations who have controversies with or axes to
B06 1900 10    grind with the government and who are retained, not
B06 1910  7    because of their legal talents, but because of their
B06 1920  5    government influence.
