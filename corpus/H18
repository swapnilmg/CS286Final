H18 0010  1    #FOREIGN POLICY IN ITS TOTAL CONTEXT#
H18 0010  7    With this enlarged role in mind, I should like to make
H18 0020  7    a few suggestions: What we in the United States do
H18 0030  3    or do not do will make a very large difference in what
H18 0040  1    happens in the rest of the world. We in this Department
H18 0040 12    must think about foreign policy in its total context.
H18 0050  7    We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over
H18 0060  5    after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy
H18 0070  2    has been extracted. Foreign policy is the total involvement
H18 0080  1    of the American people with peoples and governments
H18 0080  9    abroad. That means that, if we are to achieve a new
H18 0090 10    standard of leadership, we must think in terms of the
H18 0100  6    total context of our situation. It is the concern of
H18 0110  2    the Department of State that the American people are
H18 0110 11    safe and secure- defense is not a monopoly concern
H18 0120  7    of the Department of Defense. It is also the concern
H18 0130  6    of the Department of State that our trading relationships
H18 0140  3    with the rest of the world are vigorous, profitable,
H18 0150  1    and active- this is not just a passing interest or
H18 0150 11    a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce.
H18 0160  8    We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery
H18 0170  3    "somewhere upstairs" to resolve differences between
H18 0180  2    this and other departments. Assistant Secretaries of
H18 0190  1    State will now carry an increased burden of active
H18 0190 10    formulation and coordination of policies. Means must
H18 0200  5    be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly
H18 0210  4    and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues
H18 0220  1    in other departments concerned with foreign policy.
H18 0220  8       I think we need to concern ourselves also with the
H18 0230  8    timeliness of action. Every policy officer cannot help
H18 0240  5    but be a planning officer. Unless we keep our eyes
H18 0250  3    on the horizon ahead, we shall fail to bring ourselves
H18 0250 13    on target with the present. The movement of events
H18 0260  8    is so fast, the pace so severe, that an attempt to
H18 0270  6    peer into the future is essential if we are to think
H18 0280  3    accurately about the present. If there is anything
H18 0280 11    which we can do in the executive branch of the Government
H18 0290 10    to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions
H18 0300  7    on matters on which we must act promptly, that in itself
H18 0310  5    would be a major contribution to the conduct of our
H18 0320  3    affairs. Action taken today is often far more valuable
H18 0320 12    than action taken several months later in response
H18 0330  7    to a situation then out of control.
H18 0340  2       There will of course be times for delay and inaction.
H18 0350  1    What I am suggesting is that when we delay, or when
H18 0350 12    we fail to act, we do so intentionally and not through
H18 0360  8    inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural
H18 0370  3    difficulties.
H18 0370  4       I also hope that we can do something about reducing
H18 0380  5    the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction of
H18 0390  2    all bureaucracies. We want to stimulate ideas from
H18 0390 10    the bottom to the top of the Department. We want to
H18 0400 10    make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas
H18 0410  5    are welcome, that initiative goes right down to the
H18 0420  4    bottom and goes all the way to the top. I hope no one
H18 0430  1    expects that only Presidential appointees are looked
H18 0430  8    upon as sources of ideas. The responsibility for taking
H18 0440  7    the initiative in generating ideas is that of every
H18 0450  6    officer in the Department who has a policy function,
H18 0460  1    regardless of rank.
H18 0460  4       Further, I would hope that we could pay attention
H18 0470  3    to little things. While observing the operations of
H18 0480  1    our Government in various parts of the world, I have
H18 0480 11    felt that in many situations where our policies were
H18 0490  6    good we have tended to ignore minor problems which
H18 0500  3    spoiled our main effort. To cite only a few examples:
H18 0510  1    The wrong man in the wrong position, perhaps even in
H18 0510 11    a junior position abroad, can be a source of great
H18 0520  8    harm to our policy; the attitudes of a U.N. delegate
H18 0530  5    who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing
H18 0540  2    in New York City, or of a foreign diplomat in similar
H18 0550  1    circumstances in our Capital, can be easily be directed
H18 0550 10    against the United States and all that it stands for.
H18 0560  8    Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over
H18 0570  6    the world. Sometimes those who know about them are
H18 0580  2    too far down the line to be able to do anything about
H18 0580 14    them. I would hope that we could create the recognition
H18 0590  9    in the Department and overseas that those who come
H18 0600  6    across little things going wrong have the responsibility
H18 0610  2    for bringing these to the attention of those who can
H18 0620  1    do something about them.
H18 0620  5       If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility
H18 0630  3    for foreign policy in Washington, it follows that the
H18 0640  3    ambassador is expected to take charge overseas. This
H18 0640 11    does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in
H18 0650 10    an active, operational, interested, responsible fashion.
H18 0660  4    He is expected to know about what is going on among
H18 0670  5    the representatives of other agencies who are stationed
H18 0680  1    in his country. He is expected to supervise, to encourage,
H18 0680 11    to direct, to assist in any way he can. If any official
H18 0690 11    operation abroad begins to go wrong, we shall look
H18 0700  7    to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions
H18 0710  4    for remedial action.
H18 0710  7    #THE PROBLEMS OF A POLICY OFFICER#
H18 0720  1    It occurred to me that you might be interested in some
H18 0720 12    thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years,
H18 0730  8    in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the
H18 0740  7    public mind about what foreign policy is all about
H18 0750  4    and what it means, and of developing a certain compassion
H18 0760  1    for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside
H18 0760  9    Government. I tried to do so by calling to their attention
H18 0770 11    some of the problems that a senior departmental policy
H18 0780  6    officer faces. This means practically everybody in
H18 0790  3    this room. Whether it will strike home for you or not
H18 0800  1    will be for you to determine.
H18 0800  7       The senior policy officer may be moved to think
H18 0810  5    hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety
H18 0810 15    of stimuli: an idea in his own head, the suggestions
H18 0820 10    of a colleague, a question from the Secretary or the
H18 0830  8    President, a proposal by another department, a communication
H18 0840  4    from a foreign government or an American ambassador
H18 0850  2    abroad, the filing of an item for the agenda of the
H18 0850 13    United Nations or of any other of dozens of international
H18 0860 10    bodies, a news item read at the breakfast table, a
H18 0870  8    question to the President or the Secretary at a news
H18 0880  5    conference, a speech by a Senator or Congressman, an
H18 0890  2    article in a periodical, a resolution from a national
H18 0890 11    organization, a request for assistance from some private
H18 0900  8    American interests abroad, et cetera, ad infinitum.
H18 0910  5    The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted
H18 0920  2    for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility.
H18 0930  1       His first thought is about the question itself:
H18 0930  9    Is there a question here for American foreign policy,
H18 0940  9    and, if so, what is it? For he knows that the first
H18 0950  8    and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the
H18 0960  6    question is- that when it is accurately identified
H18 0970  1    it sometimes answers itself, and that the way in which
H18 0970 11    it is posed frequently shapes the answer.
H18 0980  5       Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own
H18 0990  5    mind, he reaches a tentative identification of the
H18 1000  1    question- tentative because it may change as he explores
H18 1000  9    it further and because, if no tolerable answer can
H18 1010  8    be found, it may have to be changed into one which
H18 1020  4    can be answered.
H18 1020  7       Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding
H18 1030  5    the problem, facts which he knows can never be complete,
H18 1040  4    and the general background, much of which has already
H18 1050  1    been lost to history. He is appreciative of the expert
H18 1050 11    help available to him and draws these resources into
H18 1060  8    play, taking care to examine at least some of the raw
H18 1070  7    material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented
H18 1080  3    conclusions. He knows that he must give the expert
H18 1080 12    his place, but he knows that he must also keep him
H18 1090 11    in it.
H18 1090 13       He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative
H18 1100  9    lines of action, including doing nothing. He knows
H18 1110  6    that he is thinking about action in relation to a future
H18 1120  5    which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful
H18 1130  1    fog. But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines
H18 1130 11    of policy, well-established precedents, the commitments
H18 1140  6    of the United States under international charters and
H18 1150  5    treaties, basic statutes, and well-understood notions
H18 1160  2    of the American people about how we are to conduct
H18 1170  1    ourselves, in policy literature such as country papers
H18 1170  9    and National Security Council papers accumulated in
H18 1180  5    the Department.
H18 1180  7       He will not be surprised to find that general principles
H18 1190  9    produce conflicting results in the factual situation
H18 1200  6    with which he is confronted. He must think about which
H18 1210  4    of these principles must take precedence. He will know
H18 1220  2    that general policy papers written months before may
H18 1220 10    not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance.
H18 1230  8    He is aware that every moderately important problem
H18 1240  5    merges imperceptibly into every other problem. He must
H18 1250  4    deal with the question of how to manage a part when
H18 1260  2    it cannot be handled without relation to the whole-
H18 1260 11    when the whole is too large to grasp.
H18 1270  6       He must think of others who have a stake in the
H18 1280  4    question and in its answer. Who should be consulted
H18 1280 13    among his colleagues in the Department or other departments
H18 1290  9    and agencies of the Government? Which American ambassadors
H18 1300  7    could provide helpful advice? Are private interests
H18 1310  5    sufficiently involved to be consulted? What is the
H18 1320  4    probable attitude of other governments, including those
H18 1330  2    less directly involved? How and at what stage and in
H18 1330 12    what sequence are other governments to be consulted?
H18 1340  7       If action is indicated, what kind of action is relevant
H18 1350  7    to the problem? The selection of the wrong tools can
H18 1360  6    mean waste, at best, and at worst an unwanted inflammation
H18 1370  2    of the problem itself. Can the President or the Secretary
H18 1380  1    act under existing authority, or will new legislation
H18 1380  9    and new money be required? Should the action be unilateral
H18 1390  8    or multilateral? Is the matter one for the United Nations
H18 1400  9    or some other international body? For, if so, the path
H18 1410  7    leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy
H18 1420  2    which adds still another dimension to the problem.
H18 1430  1    #RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS OF MANKIND#
H18 1430  7    What type of action can hope to win public support,
H18 1440  6    first in this country and then abroad? For the policy
H18 1450  4    officer will know that action can almost never be secret
H18 1460  1    and that in general the effectiveness of policy will
H18 1460 10    be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain
H18 1470  9    it. He is interested in public opinion for two reasons:
H18 1480  6    first, because it is important in itself, and, second,
H18 1490  3    because he knows that the American public cares about
H18 1500  1    a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. And,
H18 1500 10    given probable public attitudes- about which reasonably
H18 1510  6    good estimates can be made- what action is called for
H18 1520  8    to insure necessary support?
H18 1520 12       May I add a caution on this particular point? We
H18 1530 10    do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential
H18 1540  7    appointees to concern themselves too much with problems
H18 1550  5    of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy
H18 1560  2    action. In the first place our business is foreign
H18 1560 11    policy, and it is the business of the Presidential
H18 1570  9    leadership and his appointees in the Department to
H18 1580  5    consider the domestic political aspects of a problem.
H18 1590  3    Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying, "You fellows
H18 1600  1    in the Department of State don't know much about domestic
H18 1600 11    politics".
H18 1610  1       This is an important consideration. If we sit here
H18 1620  1    reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls
H18 1620  9    and other reports that cross our desks, we should realize
H18 1630  8    that this is raw, undigested opinion expressed in the
H18 1640  5    absence of leadership. What the American people will
H18 1650  3    do turns in large degree on their leadership. We cannot
H18 1660  1    test public opinion until the President and the leaders
H18 1660 10    of the country have gone to the public to explain what
H18 1670  9    is required and have asked them for support for the
H18 1680  5    necessary action. I doubt, for example, that, 3 months
H18 1690  3    before the leadership began to talk about what came
H18 1690 12    to be the Marshall plan, any public-opinion expert
H18 1700  7    would have said that the country would have accepted
H18 1710  4    such proposals.
H18 1710  6       The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins
H18 1720  6    to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors-
H18 1730  3    political, military, economic, financial, legal, legislative,
H18 1740  2    procedural, administrative- to be sorted out and handled
H18 1750  1    within a political system which moves by consent in
H18 1750 10    relation to an external environment which cannot be
H18 1760  7    under control.
H18 1760  9       And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping
H18 1770  9    at his heels.
