F10 0010  1    FRANKLIN D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when
F10 0010 11    Mrs. Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited
F10 0020  8    him in Bakersfield, California, several months ago
F10 0030  5    as a prospective patient. "Doctor" Lee asked her to
F10 0040  5    lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then, by squeezing
F10 0050  3    her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a different
F10 0060  2    diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her-
F10 0070  1    kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female
F10 0070  9    disorder. (He explained that he could diagnose these
F10 0080  6    ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the
F10 0090  4    nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the
F10 0100  1    thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone
F10 0100 11    generator" machine.
F10 0110  2       As he applied the applicator extending from the
F10 0120  1    machine- which consisted of seven differently colored
F10 0120  7    neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base- to the
F10 0130  7    supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body,
F10 0140  5    Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.
F10 0150  3    Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically
F10 0160  1    everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked,
F10 0160 10    why the colors of the tubes were important to people's
F10 0170  9    health? The human body- he pointed out, for example-
F10 0180  6    required 33 units of blue light. For that reason, he
F10 0190  5    informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing
F10 0200  1    glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:
F10 0200 10       "Don't you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden
F10 0210 10    body".
F10 0220  1       "Cancer"! Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked. "You
F10 0230  1    didn't tell me I had cancer".
F10 0230  7       "You have it, all right. But as long as you can
F10 0240  7    have treatment from my machine you have nothing to
F10 0250  2    worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure
F10 0250 12    a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body".
F10 0260  8       He urged her to buy one of his machines- for $300.
F10 0270  6    When she said that she didn't have the money, he said
F10 0280  4    that she could come in for treatment with his office
F10 0290  1    model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold
F10 0290 12    her minerals to cure her kidney ailment, a can of sage
F10 0300  8    "to make her look like a girl again", and an application
F10 0310  4    of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.
F10 0320  1       Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy
F10 0320 10    his machine when she visited him the next day. After
F10 0330  9    another treatment with the machine, he told her that
F10 0340  5    "her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts".
F10 0350  3    He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would
F10 0360  1    take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect
F10 0360 12    the money for buying his machine.
F10 0370  5       When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules,
F10 0380  3    Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's office,
F10 0390  2    Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician,
F10 0390 10    who treated her for burned tissue. For several days,
F10 0400  8    she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment.
F10 0410  4       Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand
F10 0420  4    or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone
F10 0430  1    machines. For Mrs. Shaefer- who had been given a clean
F10 0430 11    bill of health by her own physician at the time she
F10 0440 11    visited Lee- and her friend were agents for the California
F10 0450  7    Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau. And she felt
F10 0460  5    amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence
F10 0470  2    of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder
F10 0490  1    under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court
F10 0490  9    for convicting Franklin D. Lee. The charge: violation
F10 0500  7    of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing
F10 0510  5    medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs.
F10 0520  3    The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the county jail.
F10 0530  3       An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather,
F10 0540  1    it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony
F10 0540 12    therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries
F10 0550  8    of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them
F10 0560  6    of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate,
F10 0570  4    ethical medical treatment of serious diseases. The
F10 0580  2    machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of
F10 0580 11    odds and ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.
F10 0590  8       With these gadgets- impressive to the gullible because
F10 0600  6    of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, and buzzes- he
F10 0610  4    then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing
F10 0620  1    on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders
F10 0620 10    of our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific
F10 0630  9    advances, translating them into his own special Buck
F10 0640  7    Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as
F10 0650  4    a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual
F10 0660  1    impotence and cancer.
F10 0660  4       The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines
F10 0670  3    for $5 to $10,000- anything the traffic will bear.
F10 0680  6    He may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist,
F10 0690  8    an electrotherapist, a naturopath, a sanipractor, a
F10 0700  6    medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"- or what have
F10 0710  6    you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles,
F10 0720  2    but represent themselves as being associated with various
F10 0720 10    scientific or impressive foundations- foundations which
F10 0740  3    often have little more than a letterhead existence.
F10 0750  6       The medical device pirate of today, of course, is
F10 0760  6    a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor
F10 0770  1    of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake
F10 0770  9    oil and other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore
F10 0780  8    far higher- running into hundreds of millions.
F10 0790  5       According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
F10 0800  3    "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique,
F10 0810  5    and Dr. Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious device
F10 0820  2    quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000,
F10 0830  1    5000, and 2000 fake health machines.
F10 0830  7       Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds
F10 0840  7    using these false health gadgets are still in business.
F10 0850  4    Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in
F10 0860  2    Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid
F10 0860 10    $1020 to a masseur, and Mr. A., a laborer, paid $4200
F10 0870 10    to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health
F10 0880  6    machines- the "radioclast" and the "diagnometer". Multiply
F10 0890  4    these figures by the millions of people known to be
F10 0900  4    conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up
F10 0910  1    with a frightening total.
F10 0910  5       That's why the FDA, the American Medical Association
F10 0920  3    (AMA), and the National Better Business Bureau (BBB)
F10 0930  3    have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be
F10 0940  3    a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid
F10 0940 13    to medical charlatans annually.
F10 0950  3       The Postmaster General recently reported that mail
F10 0960  3    order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices
F10 0970  1    figure prominently- are at the highest level in history.
F10 0970 10    Similarly, the American Cancer Society (ACS), the
F10 0980  7    Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, and the BBB have
F10 0990  6    each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new
F10 1000  6    high. For example, the BBB has reported it was receiving
F10 1010  4    four times as many inquiries about quack devices and
F10 1020  1    10 times as many complaints compared with two years
F10 1020 10    ago.
F10 1020 11       Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures, however,
F10 1030  7    believing that any sum they come up with is only a
F10 1040  9    surface manifestation- turned up by their inevitably
F10 1050  3    limited policing- of the real loot of the medical racketeer.
F10 1060  2    In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates
F10 1060 10    of phony device quackery are conservative.
F10 1070  5       The economic toll that the device quack extracts
F10 1080  5    is important, of course. But it is our health- more
F10 1090  4    precious than all the money in the world- that these
F10 1090 14    modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets
F10 1100  8    are gambling away. By preying on the sick, by playing
F10 1110  8    callously on the hopes of the desperate, by causing
F10 1120  3    the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical
F10 1130  1    ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.
F10 1130 10       Typically, Sarah Gross and Mr. A both lost more
F10 1140  9    than their money as the result of their experiences
F10 1150  7    with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah Gross found that
F10 1160  4    the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the
F10 1170  3    masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted
F10 1170 13    medical authorities and learned that the devices her
F10 1180  8    quack "doctor" was using were phony. She suffered a
F10 1190  7    nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized.
F10 1200  1       Mr. A., her fellow townsman, also experienced a
F10 1210  2    nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that
F10 1210 11    he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited
F10 1220  9    practitioner who had been treating his wife- a woman
F10 1230  6    suffering from an incurable disease, multiple sclerosis-
F10 1240  1    and himself. Mr. A has recovered, but he is, justifiably,
F10 1250  2    a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to
F10 1260  1    lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were
F10 1260 11    helped by that chiropractor's treatments".
F10 1270  3       And there was the case of Tom Hepker, a machinist,
F10 1280  4    who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack
F10 1290  2    who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine
F10 1290 11    for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic
F10 1300 10    and strychnine. After his pains got worse, Tom decided
F10 1310  7    to see a real doctor, from whom he learned he was suffering
F10 1320  5    from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught it in time
F10 1330  4    to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human
F10 1330 15    wreck- thanks to this modern witch doctor.
F10 1340  9       But the machine quack can cause far more than just
F10 1350  7    suffering. In such diseases as cancer, tuberculosis,
F10 1360  2    and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are
F10 1360 10    so vital that the waste of time by the patient with
F10 1370 11    Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover,
F10 1380  8    the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack
F10 1390  6    device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can
F10 1400  2    be committing suicide. For instance:
F10 1400  7       In Chicago, some time ago, Mr. H., age 27, a diabetic
F10 1410 10    since he was six, stopped using insulin because he
F10 1420  4    had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube about the
F10 1430  3    size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth
F10 1430 12    a small fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company
F10 1440 10    of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all. "Hang this around
F10 1450  8    your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy,
F10 1460  5    and its rays will cure any disease you have", said
F10 1470  2    the company. Mr. H. is dead today because he followed
F10 1470 12    this advice.
F10 1480  2       Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken
F10 1490  1    by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll, a sanipractor-
F10 1490 11    a licensed drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed
F10 1500  7    Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and
F10 1510 10    putting it on his "radionic" machine and twirling some
F10 1520  5    knobs (fee $50).
F10 1520  8       His prescription: hot and cold compresses to increase
F10 1530  7    her absorption of water. Although she weighed only
F10 1540  4    108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted
F10 1550  1    her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing
F10 1550 14    but water. Inevitably, Mrs. Hull died of starvation
F10 1560  7    and tuberculosis, weighing 60 pounds. Moreover, her
F10 1570  5    husband and child contracted T.B. from her. (Small
F10 1580  4    wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for
F10 1590  2    his wife's death.)
F10 1590  5       In California, a few years ago, a ghoul by the name
F10 1600  4    of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for
F10 1610  2    cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying
F10 1610 12    up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors
F10 1620  8    of patients who had died, reconditioning them, and
F10 1630  4    selling them at $185 each. When authorities convicted
F10 1640  2    him of practicing medicine without a license (he got
F10 1640 11    off with a suspended sentence of three years because
F10 1650  8    of his advanced age of 77), one of his victims was
F10 1660  7    not around to testify: He was dead of cancer.
F10 1670  2       By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately",
F10 1680  1    says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens, who
F10 1680  9    has prosecuted many device quacks, "the ghouls who
F10 1690  7    trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot
F10 1700  6    be successfully prosecuted because the patients who
F10 1710  3    are the chief witnesses die before the case is called
F10 1710 13    up in court".
F10 1720  3    ##
F10 1720  4    DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's where device
F10 1730  3    quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic
F10 1740  1    machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have
F10 1740  8    hastened the deaths of thousands.
F10 1750  4       Who are the victims of the device quacks? Authorities
F10 1760  2    say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace
F10 1770  1    F. Jannsen, director of the FDA's Division of Public
F10 1770 10    Information: "Quacks are apt to direct their appeal
F10 1780  8    directly to older people, or to sufferers from chronic
F10 1790  7    ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, diabetes, and
F10 1800  3    cancer. People who have not been able to get relief
F10 1810  2    from regular medical doctors are especially apt to
F10 1810 10    be taken in by quacks". The victims of the quacks are
F10 1820  9    frequently poor people, like Mr. A., who scrape up
F10 1830  6    their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor
F10 1840  3    Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as
F10 1850  1    underprivileged.
