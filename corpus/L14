L14 0010  1    A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink
L14 0010 14    woman in a small office at the end of a long, dim corridor
L14 0020 10    and made pencil lines on paper and said, "Is this more
L14 0030  6    like it, Mrs. MacReady? Or are the eyebrows more like
L14 0040  5    this"? When he had finished with that, he would go
L14 0050  3    to another part of the hotel and say much the same
L14 0050 14    things to someone else, most probably a busboy. "Begin
L14 0060  8    to look like him now, would you say? Different about
L14 0070  6    the mouth, huh? More like this, maybe"?
L14 0080  2       Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth
L14 0090  1    floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again, and
L14 0090 12    did the same in a tiny, almost airless room in a tenement
L14 0100 10    in the West Forties. And men also used vacuum cleaners
L14 0110  7    in both rooms, sucking dust up once more.
L14 0120  2       Men from the Third Detective District, Eighteenth
L14 0120  9    Precinct, had the longest, the most tedious, job. At
L14 0130  9    the Hotel Dumont there had, at the time in issue, been
L14 0140  9    twenty-three overnighters, counting couples as singular.
L14 0150  4    These included, as one, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne,
L14 0160  3    who had checked in a little after noon the day before,
L14 0170  1    and had not checked out together. But Gardner Willings
L14 0170 10    was not included; he had been at the Dumont for almost
L14 0180 10    a week. There was, of course, no special reason to
L14 0190  7    believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed
L14 0200  3    only overnight at the hotel. The twenty-three (or twenty-two
L14 0210  1    with the Paynes themselves omitted) provided merely
L14 0210  8    a place to start, and their identification was the
L14 0220  7    barest of starts. With names and addresses listed,
L14 0230  4    verification came next. It would take time; it would,
L14 0240  3    almost inevitably, trouble some water. ("I certainly
L14 0240 10    was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't
L14 0250 11    have been. He's in Boston. Of course he's in"-)
L14 0260  7       The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided
L14 0270  6    almost twice as many problems. The King Arthur offered
L14 0280  5    respectable and convenient lodgings to people from
L14 0290  2    the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want-
L14 0290 13    heaven knew didn't want!- to lunge anxiously through
L14 0300  8    crowded streets to railroad stations and, at odd hours
L14 0310  8    of night, drive from smaller stations to distant homes,
L14 0320  4    probably through rain or, in November, something worse.
L14 0330  2    The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont.
L14 0330 11    The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters, again
L14 0340  8    counting rooms rather than people.
L14 0350  3       Check the overnighters out. Failing to find what
L14 0360  2    was wanted, as was most likely, check out other guests,
L14 0360 12    with special- but not exclusive- attention to those
L14 0370  9    with rooms on the street. (Anyone active enough can
L14 0380  5    reach a roof, wherever his room may be.) And know,
L14 0390  2    while all this went on, that there was no real reason
L14 0390 13    to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either
L14 0400 10    hotel. It was not even certain the shot had been fired
L14 0410  7    from either hotel. There were other roofs, less convenient
L14 0420  4    but not impossible. It is dull business, detecting,
L14 0430  1    and hard on feet.
L14 0430  5       There was also the one salient question to ask,
L14 0440  3    and ask widely: Did you notice anything out of the
L14 0440 13    way? Like, for example, a man carrying a twenty-two
L14 0450 10    rifle, probably with a telescopic sight attached?
L14 0460  5       There was, of course, no hope it really would be
L14 0470  5    that simple. The sniper, whether psychopathic marksman
L14 0480  1    or murderer by intent, would hardly have walked to
L14 0480 10    his vantage point with rifle over shoulder, whistling
L14 0490  6    a marching tune. Anybody carrying anything that might
L14 0500  4    hide a rifle? Long thin suitcase? Or long fat suitcase,
L14 0510  3    for that matter? Shrugs met that, from room clerks,
L14 0520  1    from bellhops. Who measures? But nothing, it appeared,
L14 0520  9    long enough to attract attention. Cases, say, for musical
L14 0530  8    instruments? None noted at the Dumont. Several at the
L14 0540  8    King Arthur. A combo was staying there. And had been
L14 0550  5    for a week. Anything else? Anything at all? Shrugs
L14 0560  3    met that.
L14 0560  5       (Detective Pearson, Eighteenth Precinct, thought
L14 0570  2    for a time he might be on to something. A refuse bin
L14 0570 14    at the Dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long
L14 0580 11    box for very long-stemmed flowers. Traces of oil on
L14 0590  8    green tissue? The lab to check. The lab: Sorry. No
L14 0600  5    oil.)
L14 0600  6       Anything at all strange?
L14 0610  1       Well, a man had tried, at the King Arthur, to register
L14 0610 12    with an ocelot. At the Dumont, a guest had come in
L14 0620 11    a collapsible wheel chair. At the King Arthur one guest
L14 0630  7    had had his head heavily bandaged, and another had
L14 0640  4    a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches. There
L14 0650  1    had also been a man who must have had St. Vitus or
L14 0650 13    something, because he kept jerking his head.
L14 0660  6       As reports dribbled in, William Weigand tossed them
L14 0670  4    into the centrifuge which had become his head. Mullins
L14 0680  2    came in. There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at
L14 0680 13    her house on Nod Road, Ridgefield, Connecticut. The
L14 0690  8    house was modern, large, on five acres. Must have cost
L14 0700  8    plenty. The State cops would check from time to time;
L14 0710  6    pass word when there was word to pass. Weigand tossed
L14 0720  2    this news into the centrifuge. Sort things out, damn
L14 0720 11    it. Sort out the next move.
L14 0730  6       Try to forget motive for the moment. Consider opportunity.
L14 0740  3    Only those actually with Payne when he was shot, or
L14 0750  2    who had left the party within not more than five minutes
L14 0750 13    (make five arbitrary) positively had none. The Norths;
L14 0760  8    Hathaway, Jerry's publicity director; Livingston Birdwood,
L14 0770  5    producer of Uprising. They had been with Payne when
L14 0780  7    he was shot, could not therefore have shot him from
L14 0790  5    above.
L14 0790  6       Take Gardner Willings. He had left after the scuffle;
L14 0800  5    had been seen to leave. He would have had ample time
L14 0810  2    to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey. Consider
L14 0810 13    him seriously, therefore? Intangibles entered, then-
L14 0820  6    hunches which felt like facts. Willings would ambush,
L14 0830  7    certainly; Willings undoubtedly had. Willings was,
L14 0840  4    presumably, a better than average shot. But- hunch,
L14 0850  4    now- Willings would not ambush anything which went
L14 0850 12    on two legs instead of four. Because, if for no other
L14 0860 10    reason, Willings would never for a moment suppose he
L14 0870  7    was not bigger, tougher, than anything else that went
L14 0880  4    on two legs. Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves,
L14 0890  1    as any man may against a tiger.
L14 0890  8       Faith Constable had had to "go on" from the party
L14 0900  8    and had, presumably, gone on. To be checked out further.
L14 0910  5    Forget motive? No, motive is a part of fact. Nobody
L14 0920  2    in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction.
L14 0930  1    Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind.
L14 0930 12    Faith Constable had accomplished much in a quarter
L14 0940  7    of a century. Jeopardize it now to correct so old a
L14 0950  6    wrong? Bill shook his head. Also, he thought, I doubt
L14 0960  3    if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun.
L14 0970  1       Lauren herself? She had left the party early, pleading
L14 0970  9    a headache. No lack of opportunity, presuming she had
L14 0980  8    a gun. She might, conceivably, have brought one in
L14 0990  5    in a large-enough suitcase. (Check on the Payne luggage.)
L14 1000  3    She might now have taken it away again. Motive- her
L14 1010  1    husband wandering? Bitter, unreasoning jealousy? Heaven
L14 1010  7    knew it happened and hell knew it too. But- it happened,
L14 1020 11    almost always, among the primitive and, usually, among
L14 1030  7    the very young. (Call it mentally young; call it retarded.)
L14 1040  5    There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was
L14 1050  3    primitive. She did not move in primitive circles. She
L14 1060  1    was young, but not that young.
L14 1060  7       It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was, on a hunch
L14 1070  7    basis, eliminating a good many. He reminded himself
L14 1080  2    that all eliminations were tentative. He also reminded
L14 1080 10    himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities.
L14 1090  9       The Masons, mother or son, or mother and son? Opportunity
L14 1100  9    was obvious. Motive. Here, too, the cause to hate lay
L14 1110  8    well back in the years. But bitterness had more cause
L14 1120  5    to remain, even increasingly to corrode. With the boy,
L14 1130  3    particularly. The boy had, apparently- if Mrs. MacReady
L14 1140  1    was right in what she had told Mullins- only in recent
L14 1140 12    months been forced to give up college, to work as a
L14 1150 11    busboy. Seeing the man he blamed for this made much
L14 1160  7    of- youth and bitterness and-
L14 1170  1       Bill picked up the telephone; got Mullins.
L14 1170  8       "Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when
L14 1180  9    you've got enough to go on", Bill said. "Right"?
L14 1190  4       Mullins would do.
L14 1190  7       A man named Lars Simon, playwright-director, had
L14 1200  8    expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead. He would
L14 1210  7    say, of course, that he had not really had any such
L14 1220  5    wish; that what he had said was no more than one of
L14 1230  2    those things one does say, lightly, meaning nothing.
L14 1230 10    Which probably would turn out to be true; which he
L14 1240  9    obviously had to be given the opportunity to say.
L14 1250  4       A man named Blaine Smythe, with "y" and "e" but
L14 1260  4    pronounced without them, had been fired at Payne's
L14 1270  1    insistence. He was also, if Pam North was right, a
L14 1270 11    closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's than she, now,
L14 1280  7    was inclined to admit. He might deny the latter; would
L14 1290  7    certainly deny any connection between the two things,
L14 1300  4    or any connection of either with murder. He would have
L14 1310  2    to be given the opportunity.
L14 1310  7       Mullins? It was evident that Mullins was the man
L14 1320  6    to go. It was evident that a captain should remain
L14 1330  2    at his desk, directing with a firm hand and keeping
L14 1330 12    a firm seat. Bill Weigand was good and tired of the
L14 1340  9    wall opposite, and the crack in the plaster. Let Mullins
L14 1350  6    keep the firm seat; let Stein.
L14 1360  1    #@#
L14 1360  1    When Siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to
L14 1360 10    tell where one leaves off and another begins. Stilts
L14 1370  8    and Shadow, on Pam's bed, appeared to be one cat- rather
L14 1380  8    large, as Siamese cats go, and, to be sure, having
L14 1400  5    two heads and two tails. On the other hand, they, or
L14 1410  2    it, seemed to have no legs whatever. Pamela North said,
L14 1410 12    "Hi", to her cats, and added that proper cats met their
L14 1420 11    humans at the door. Of four dark brown ears, one twitched
L14 1430  8    slightly at this. "All right", Pam said. "I know it
L14 1440  6    isn't dinnertime".
L14 1440  8       But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became
L14 1450  9    two cats, stretching. Shadow, the more talkative, began
L14 1460  5    at once to talk, her voice piteous. Stilts, a more
L14 1470  3    direct cat, leaped from the bed and trotted briskly
L14 1470 12    toward the kitchen. Shadow looked surprised, wailed,
L14 1480  7    and trotted after her. The hell it isn't dinnertime,
L14 1490  6    two waving tails told Pam North.
L14 1500  1       It was not, whatever tale was told by tails. Martha
L14 1500 11    presumably would cope. She might be firm. It was most
L14 1510 10    unlikely that she would be firm. They want to be fat
L14 1520  8    cats, Pam thought, and lighted a cigarette and leaned
L14 1530  3    back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts
L14 1530 12    together. After a time, it occurred to her that her
L14 1540 10    thoughts were not worth the trouble. A vague feeling
L14 1550  6    that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought
L14 1560  5    and was, in any event, reprehensible. Had Faith Constable's
L14 1570  2    explanation of her confidence, so uninvited, been a
L14 1580  1    little thin? That was more like a thought, but not
L14 1580 11    a great deal more. Had that tall dark boy, carrying
L14 1590  7    trays too heavy for him, found what he might have considered
L14 1600  5    adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could
L14 1610  4    bear? And possessed himself- how?- of a rifle and killed?
L14 1620  3    Pam found she had no answers; had only a hope. The
L14 1620 14    poor kid- the poor, frail kid. Some people have luck
L14 1630  9    and some have no luck and that, whatever people who
L14 1640  7    prefer order say, is the size of it. The poor, unlucky-
L14 1650  5       The telephone rang. Pam realized, to her surprise,
L14 1660  3    that she had been almost dozing. At four o'clock in
L14 1670  1    the afternoon. Two martinis for lunch- that was the
L14 1670 10    trouble. I ought to remember. Don't pretend. You do
L14 1680  7    remember. You just- "Hello? Yes, this is she? What"?
L14 1690  6       The voice had music in it. Even with words coming
L14 1700  7    too fast, they came on the music of the voice.
L14 1710  2       "I said I would", Pam said. "They won't talk about
L14 1720  2    who gave the information. Not unless they have to.
L14 1720 11    They don't, Mrs. Constable. Not unless they have"-
L14 1730  7       She was interrupted.
L14 1740  2       "Call this a cry for help", Faith Constable said.
