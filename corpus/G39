G39 0010  1    When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter
G39 0010 10    of 1944, it was to take up again a collaboration with
G39 0020  9    Johnny Mercer, begun some years before. The film they
G39 0030  6    did after his return was an inconsequential bit of
G39 0040  3    nothing titled Out of This World, a satire on the Sinatra
G39 0050  1    bobby-soxer craze. The twist lay in using Bing Crosby's
G39 0050 11    voice on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken
G39 0060 10    mouthed the words. If nothing else, at least two good
G39 0070  9    songs came out of the project, "Out of This World"
G39 0080  5    and "June Comes Around Every Year".
G39 0090  1       Though they would produce some very memorable and
G39 0090  9    lasting songs, Arlen and Mercer were not given strong
G39 0100  9    material to work on. Their first collaboration came
G39 0110  5    close. Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script
G39 0120  4    titled Hot Nocturne. It purported to be a reasonably
G39 0130  1    serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians, their
G39 0130 10    aims, their problems- the tug-of-war between the "pure"
G39 0140  8    and the "commercial"- and seemed a promising vehicle,
G39 0150  8    for the two men shared a common interest in jazz.
G39 0160  5       Johnny Mercer practically grew up with the sound
G39 0170  3    of jazz and the blues in his ears. He was born in Savannah,
G39 0180  1    Georgia, in 1909. His father, George A. Mercer, was
G39 0180 10    descended from an honored Southern family that could
G39 0190  8    trace its ancestry back to one Hugh Mercer, who had
G39 0200  7    emigrated from Scotland in 1747.
G39 0210  1       The lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched
G39 0210 10    out into real estate. His second wife, Lillian, was
G39 0220  8    the mother of John H. Mercer. By the age of six young
G39 0230  8    Johnny indicated that he had the call. One day he followed
G39 0240  6    the Irish Jasper Greens, the town band, to a picnic
G39 0250  4    and spent the entire day listening, while his family
G39 0250 13    spent the day looking. The disappearance caused his
G39 0260  8    family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye
G39 0270  6    on the boy. But one afternoon Mrs. Mercer met her;
G39 0280  4    both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home.
G39 0290  1    The mother inquired, "Where's Johnny, and why did you
G39 0290 10    leave him"? "There was nothing else I could do", the
G39 0300  9    maid answered, satisfied with a rather vague explanation.
G39 0310  7    But Mrs. Mercer demanded more. The maid then told her,
G39 0320  7    "Because he fired me".
G39 0330  1       With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent
G39 0330  9    his mother could do little else but get him started
G39 0340  6    on the study of music- though she waited until he was
G39 0350  4    ten- beginning with the piano and following that with
G39 0360  1    the trumpet. Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack
G39 0360  9    of aptitude for both instruments. Still, he did like
G39 0370  7    music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the
G39 0380  6    Woodberry Forest School, near Orange, Virginia, where
G39 0390  2    he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well.
G39 0400  1       When he was fifteen John H. Mercer turned out his
G39 0400 11    first song, a jazzy little thing he called "Sister
G39 0410  7    Susie, Strut Your Stuff". If his scholarship and formal
G39 0430  6    musicianship were not all they might have been, Mercer
G39 0440  3    demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with
G39 0450  1    a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect. From his playmates
G39 0450 11    in Savannah, Mercer had picked up, along with a soft
G39 0460  9    Southern dialect, traces also of the Gullah dialects
G39 0470  6    of Africa. Such speech differences made him acutely
G39 0480  4    aware of the richness and expressivness of language.
G39 0490  1       During the summers, while he was still in school,
G39 0490 10    Mercer worked for his father's firm as a messenger
G39 0500  8    boy. It generally took well into the autumn for the
G39 0510  6    firm to recover from the summer's help. "We'd give
G39 0520  2    him things to deliver, letters, checks, deeds and things
G39 0530  1    like that", remembers his half-brother Walter, still
G39 0530  9    in the real estate business in Savannah, "and learn
G39 0540  6    days later that he'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into
G39 0550  4    his pocket. There they stayed".
G39 0560  1       This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances
G39 0560  7    has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality
G39 0570  9    ever since. It is, however, a disarming disguise, or
G39 0580  7    perhaps a shield, for not only has Mercer proved himself
G39 0590  4    to be one of the few great lyricists over the years,
G39 0600  2    but also one who can function remarkably under pressure.
G39 0600 11    He has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer
G39 0610 10    (his records have sold in the millions) and is a sharp
G39 0620  9    businessman.
G39 0620 10       He has also an extraordinary conscience. In 1927
G39 0630  6    his father's business collapsed, and, rather than go
G39 0640  5    bankrupt, Mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank
G39 0650  4    for liquidation. He died before he could completely
G39 0650 12    pay off his debts. Some years later the bank handling
G39 0660  9    the Mercer liquidation received a check for $300,000,
G39 0670  6    enough to clear up the debt. The check had been mailed
G39 0680  4    from Chicago, the envelope bore no return address,
G39 0690  1    and the check was not signed.
G39 0690  7       "That's Johnny", sighed the bank president, "the
G39 0700  5    best-hearted boy in the world, but absent-minded".
G39 0710  1    But Mercer's explanation was simple: "I made out the
G39 0720  2    check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in
G39 0720 12    case I lost it". When he remembered that he might have
G39 0730  9    not signed the check, Mercer made out another for the
G39 0740  7    same amount, instructing the bank to destroy the other-
G39 0750  4    especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly
G39 0760  1    signed both of them.
G39 0760  5       When the family business failed, Mercer left school
G39 0770  3    and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he would
G39 0780  2    become an actor- he joined a local little theater group.
G39 0780 12    When the troupe traveled to New York to participate
G39 0790  9    in a one-act-play competition- and won- Mercer, instead
G39 0800  7    of returning with the rest of the company in triumph,
G39 0810  5    remained in New York. He had talked one other member
G39 0820  2    of the group to stay with him, but that friend had
G39 0820 13    tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah.
G39 0830  8    But Mercer hung on, living, after a fashion, in a Greenwich
G39 0840  8    Village fourth-flight walk-up. "The place had no sink
G39 0850  6    or washbasin, only a bathtub", his mother discovered
G39 0860  2    when she visited him. "Johnny insisted on cooking a
G39 0870  1    chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good
G39 0870 11    cook- and I'll never forget him cleaning the chicken
G39 0880  7    in the tub".
G39 0880 10       A story, no doubt apocryphal, for Mercer himself
G39 0890  7    denies it, has him sporting a monacle in those Village
G39 0900  6    days. Though merely clear glass, it was a distinctive
G39 0910  4    trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint
G39 0920  1    himself upon the memories of producers. One day in
G39 0920 10    a bar, so the legend goes, someone put a beer stein
G39 0930  7    with too much force on the monacle and broke it. The
G39 0940  5    innocent malfeasant, filled with that supreme sense
G39 0950  1    of honor found in bars, insisted upon replacing the
G39 0950 10    destroyed monacle- and did, over the protests of the
G39 0960 10    former owner- with a square monacle. Mercer is supposed
G39 0970  4    to have refused it with, "Anyone who wears a square
G39 0980  3    monacle must be affected"!
G39 0980  7       Everett Miller, then assistant director for the
G39 0990  5    Garrick Gaieties, a Theatre Guild production, needed
G39 1000  3    a lyricist for a song he had written; he just happened
G39 1010  2    not to need any actor at the moment, however. For him
G39 1010 13    Mercer produced the lyric to "Out of Breath Scared
G39 1020  9    to Death of You", introduced in that most successful
G39 1030  6    of all the Gaieties, by Sterling Holloway. This 1930
G39 1040  4    edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke and Ira
G39 1050  3    Gershwin, by E. Y. Harburg and Duke, and by Harry Myers.
G39 1060  2    Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged
G39 1070  1    the burgeoning song writer to take a wife, Elizabeth
G39 1070 10    Meehan, a dancer in the Gaieties. The Mercers took
G39 1080  7    up residence in Brooklyn, and Mercer found a regular
G39 1090  6    job in Wall Street "misplacing stocks and bonds".
G39 1100  3       When he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking for
G39 1110  2    singers to replace the Rhythm Boys, Mercer applied
G39 1110 10    and got the job, "not for my voice, I'm sure, but because
G39 1120 10    I could write songs and material generally". While
G39 1130  5    with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen. He had
G39 1140  5    yet to meet Harold Arlen, for although they had "collaborated"
G39 1150  3    on "Satan's Li'l Lamb", Mercer and Harburg had worked
G39 1160  4    from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them.
G39 1170  1    The lyric, Mercer remembers, was tailored to fit the
G39 1170 10    unusual melody.
G39 1180  1       Mercer's Whiteman association brought him into contact
G39 1190  1    with Hoagy Carmichael, whose "Snowball" Mercer relyriced
G39 1200  7    as "Lazybones", in which form it became a hit and marked
G39 1210 10    the real beginning of Mercer's song-writing career.
G39 1220  6    After leaving Whiteman, Mercer joined the Benny Goodman
G39 1230  5    band as a vocalist. With the help of Ziggy Elman, also
G39 1240  3    in the band, he transformed a traditional Jewish melody
G39 1250  1    into a popular song, "And the Angels Sing". The countrywide
G39 1260  1    success of "Lazybones" and "And the Angels Sing" could
G39 1260 10    only lead to Hollywood, where, besides Harold Arlen,
G39 1270  8    Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren, Jimmy Van Heusen,
G39 1280  7    Richard Whiting, Walter Donaldson, Jerome Kern, and
G39 1290  5    Arthur Schwartz. Mercer has also written both music
G39 1300  4    and lyrics for several songs. He may be the only song
G39 1310  2    writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of
G39 1310 11    the U. S. Treasury; he collaborated on a song with
G39 1320  8    William Hartman Woodin, who was Secretary of the Treasury,
G39 1330  7    1932-33.
G39 1330  9       When Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen began their
G39 1340  7    collaboration in 1940, Mercer, like Arlen, had several
G39 1350  5    substantial film songs to his credit, among them "Hooray
G39 1360  3    for Hollywood", "Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride", "Have You
G39 1370  3    Got Any Castles, Baby?", and "Too Marvelous for Words"
G39 1380  3    (all with Richard Whiting); with Harry Warren he did
G39 1390  2    "The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish", "Jeepers
G39 1390 10    Creepers", and "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby".
G39 1400  9    Mercer's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear
G39 1410  8    for rhythmic nuances, a puckish sense of humor expressed
G39 1420  7    in language with a colloquial flair. Though versatile
G39 1430  3    and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the
G39 1440  2    best of them, Mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk
G39 1440 13    wit.
G39 1450  1       His casual, dreamlike working methods, often as
G39 1450  8    not in absentia, were an abrupt change from Harburg's,
G39 1460  7    so that Arlen had to adjust again to another approach
G39 1470  7    to collaboration. There were times that he worked with
G39 1480  5    both lyricists simultaneously.
G39 1480  8       Speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer, Arlen says,
G39 1490  9    "Our working habits were strange. After we got a script
G39 1500  8    and the spots for the songs were blocked out, we'd
G39 1510  4    get together for an hour or so every day. While Johnny
G39 1520  1    made himself comfortable on the couch, I'd play the
G39 1520 10    tunes for him. He has a wonderfully retentive memory.
G39 1530  8    After I would finish playing the songs, he'd just go
G39 1540  7    away without a comment. I wouldn't hear from him for
G39 1550  5    a couple of weeks, then he'd come around with the completed
G39 1560  2    lyric".
G39 1560  3       Arlen is one of the few (possibly the only) composer
G39 1570  2    Mercer has been able to work with so closely, for they
G39 1570 13    held their meetings in Arlen's study. "Some guys bothered
G39 1580  9    me", Mercer has said. "I couldn't write with them in
G39 1590 10    the same room with me, but I could with Harold. He
G39 1600  8    is probably our most original composer; he often uses
G39 1610  4    very odd rhythms, which makes it difficult, and challenging,
G39 1620  2    for the lyric writer".
G39 1620  6       While Arlen and Mercer collaborated on Hot Nocturne,
G39 1630  5    Mercer worked also with Arthur Schwartz on another
G39 1640  4    film, Navy Blues. Arlen, too, worked on other projects
G39 1650  3    at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler. Besides
G39 1660  1    doing a single song, "When the Sun Comes Out", they
G39 1660 11    worked on the ambitious Americanegro Suite, for voices
G39 1670  7    and piano, as well as songs for films.
G39 1680  5       The Americanegro Suite is in a sense an extension
G39 1690  3    of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection
G39 1700  1    of Negro songs, not for a night club, but for the concert
G39 1700 13    stage. The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar
G39 1710 11    musical strain to which Koehler set the words "There'll
G39 1720  6    be no more work/ There'll be no more worry", matching
G39 1730  4    the spiritual feeling of the jot. This grew into the
G39 1740  3    song "Big Time Comin'". By September 1940 the suite
G39 1750  1    had developed into a collection of six songs, "four
G39 1750 10    spirituals, a dream, and a lullaby".
G39 1760  5       The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied the Americanegro
G39 1770  3    Suite and said of it, "Of all the many songs written
G39 1780  3    by white composers and employing what claims to be
G39 1780 12    a Negroid idiom in both words and music, these six
G39 1790  9    songs by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler easily stand
G39 1800  6    far out above the rest. Thoroughly modern in treatment,
G39 1810  4    they are at the same time, full of simple sincerity
G39 1820  1    which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music
G39 1820  8    and are by no means to be confused with the average
G39 1830  9    'Broadway Spirituals' which depend for their racial
G39 1840  6    flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'Amen Corner',
G39 1850  2    'judgement day', 'Gabriel's horn', and a frustrated
G39 1860  2    devil- with a few random 'Hallelujahs' thrown in for
G39 1870  1    good measure.
