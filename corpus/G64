G64 0010  1    The Bishop of Gloucester described the elder Thomas
G64 0010  9    in 1577 as the richest recusant in his diocese, worth
G64 0020  7    five hundred pounds a year in lands and goods. When
G64 0030  5    Quiney and William Parsons wrote to Greville in 1593
G64 0040  3    asking his consent in the election for bailiff, they
G64 0040 12    sent the letter to Mr. William Sawnders, attendant
G64 0050  7    on the worshipful Mr. Thomas Bushell at Marston. Mr.
G64 0060  6    Bushell was mentioned in 1602 in the will of Joyce
G64 0070  6    Hobday, widow of a Stratford glover. Thomas the elder
G64 0080  3    married twice, had seventeen children, and died in
G64 0080 11    1615. His daughter Elinor married Quiney's son Adrian
G64 0090  7    in 1613, and his son Henry married Mary Lane of Stratford
G64 0100  7    in 1609. His son Thomas, aged fifteen when he entered
G64 0110  6    Oxford in 1582, married as his first wife Margaret,
G64 0120  2    sister of Sir Edward Greville. Bridges, a son by his
G64 0130  1    second wife, was christened at Pebworth in 1607, but
G64 0130 10    Thomas the younger was living at Packwood two years
G64 0140  7    later and sold Broad Marston manor in 1622. A third
G64 0150  6    Thomas Bushell (1594-1674), "much loved" by Bacon,
G64 0160  3    called himself "the Superlative Prodigall" in The First
G64 0170  2    Part of Youths Errors (1628) and became an expert on
G64 0170 12    silver mines and on the art of running into debt.
G64 0180 10       Edward Greville, born about 1565, had inherited
G64 0190  6    Milcote on the execution of his father Lodowick for
G64 0200  3    murder in 1589. He refused his consent to the election
G64 0210  1    of Quiney as bailiff in 1592, but gave it at the request
G64 0210 13    of the recorder, his cousin Sir Fulke Greville. The
G64 0220  8    corporation entertained him for dinner at Quiney's
G64 0230  6    house in 1596VII with wine and sugar sent by the bailiff,
G64 0240  5    Sturley. At Milcote on November 3, 1597, the aldermen
G64 0250  2    asked him to support their petition for a new charter.
G64 0250 12    Sturley wrote to Quiney that Sir Edward "gave his allowance
G64 0260 10    and liking thereof, and affied unto us his best endeavour,
G64 0270  9    so that his rights be preserved", and that "Sir Edward
G64 0280  6    saith we shall not be at any fault for money for prosecuting
G64 0290  6    the cause, for himself will procure it and lay it down
G64 0300  5    for us for the time". Greville proposed Quiney as the
G64 0310  2    fittest man "for the following of the cause and to
G64 0310 12    attend him in the matter", and at his suggestion the
G64 0320  8    corporation allowed Quiney two shillings a day. "If
G64 0330  6    you can firmly make the good knight sure to pleasure
G64 0340  3    our Corporation", Sturley wrote, "besides that ordinary
G64 0350  1    allowance for your diet you shall have @20 for recompence".
G64 0350 11       In his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January
G64 0360  8    24, 1597VIII Sturley asked Quiney especially that "theare
G64 0370  6    might [be] bi Sir Ed. Grev. some meanes made to the
G64 0380  7    Knightes of the Parliament for an ease and discharge
G64 0390  5    of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne is
G64 0400  2    like to be charged, and I assure u I am in great feare
G64 0400 15    and doubte bi no meanes hable to paie. Sir Ed. Gre.
G64 0410 10    is gonne to Brestowe and from thence to Lond. as I
G64 0420  8    heare, who verie well knoweth our estates and wil be
G64 0430  4    willinge to do us ani good". The knights for Warwickshire
G64 0440  1    in this parliament, which ended its session on February
G64 0440 10    9, were Fulke Greville (the poet) and William Combe
G64 0450  9    of Warwick, as Fulke Greville and Edward Greville had
G64 0460  6    been in 1593. The corporation voted on September 27,
G64 0470  5    1598, that Quiney should ride to London about the suit
G64 0480  3    to Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the Exchequer,
G64 0490  1    for discharging of the tax and subsidy. He had been
G64 0490 11    in London for several weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare
G64 0500  7    on October 25. Sturley on November 4 answered a letter
G64 0510  6    from Quiney written on October 25 which imported, wrote
G64 0520  3    Sturley, "that our countriman **f **f Shak. would procure
G64 0530  2    us monei: which I will like of as I shall heare when
G64 0530 14    wheare + howe: and I prai let not go that occasion
G64 0540 11    if it mai sort to ani indifferent condicions. Allso
G64 0550  5    that if monei might be had for 30 or **f a lease +c.
G64 0560  6    might be procured". Sturley quoted Quiney as having
G64 0570  2    written on November 1 that if he had "more monei presente
G64 0570 13    much might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd,
G64 0580  9    ij. faires more, with tole of corne, bestes, and sheepe,
G64 0590  7    and a matter of more valewe then all that". Sturley
G64 0600  4    thought that this matter might be "the rest of the
G64 0610  3    tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne".
G64 0610 13    He suggested offering half to Sir Edward, fearing lest
G64 0620  9    "he shall thinke it to good for us and procure it for
G64 0630 10    himselfe, as he served us the last time". This refers
G64 0640  5    to what had happened after the Earl of Warwick died
G64 0650  2    in 1590, when the town petitioned Burghley for the
G64 0650 11    right to name the vicar and schoolmaster and other
G64 0660  8    privileges but Greville bought the lordship for himself.
G64 0670  5    Sturley's allusion probably explains why Greville took
G64 0680  4    out the patent in the names of Best and Wells, for
G64 0690  2    Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as "a scrivener within
G64 0690 11    Temple Bar, that deals in many matters for my L. Essex"
G64 0700 11    through Sir Gelly Merrick, especially in "causes that
G64 0710  7    he would not be known of".
G64 0720  2       Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October
G64 0730  1    29 and again perhaps the next day, since the bearer
G64 0730 11    of the letter, the bailiff, was expected to reach London
G64 0740  7    on November 1. In his second letter the old mercer
G64 0750  5    advised his son "to bye some such warys as yow may
G64 0760  2    selle presentlye with profet. yff yow bargen with **f
G64 0760 11    sha ... [so in the MS] or Receave money ther or brynge
G64 0770 11    your money home yow maye see howe knite stockynges
G64 0780  7    be sold ther ys gret byinge of them at Aysshom ...
G64 0790  4    wherefore I thynke yow maye doo good yff yow can have
G64 0800  1    money". This seems to refer, not to the loan Richard
G64 0800 11    had asked for, but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare.
G64 0810  9       Richard Quiney the younger, a schoolboy of eleven,
G64 0820  7    wrote a letter in Latin asking his father to buy copybooks
G64 0830  6    ("chartaceos libellos") for him and his brother. His
G64 0840  5    mother Bess, who could not write herself, reminded
G64 0850  1    her husband through Sturley to buy the apron he had
G64 0850 11    promised her and "a suite of hattes for 5 boies the
G64 0860 10    yongst lined + trimmed with silke" (for John, only
G64 0870  4    a year old). A letter signed "Isabell Bardall" entreated
G64 0880  2    "Good Cozen" Quiney to find her stepson Adrian, son
G64 0890  2    of George Bardell, a place in London with some handicraftsman.
G64 0900  1    William Parsons and William Walford, drapers, asked
G64 0900  8    Quiney to see to business matters in London. Daniel
G64 0910  8    Baker deluged his "Unckle Quyne" with requests to pay
G64 0920  6    money for him to drapers in Watling Street and at the
G64 0930  5    Two Cats in Canning Street. His letter of October 26
G64 0940  3    named two of the men about whom Quiney had written
G64 0940 13    to Shakespeare the day before. Baker wrote: "I tooke
G64 0950  8    order with **f E. Grevile for the payment of Ceartaine
G64 0960  7    monei beefore his going towardes London. + synce I
G64 0970  5    did write unto him to dessier him to paie **f for mee
G64 0980  3    which standeth mee greatly uppon to have paide. + **f
G64 0980 13    more **f peeter Rowswell tooke order with his master
G64 0990  6    to paie for mee". He asked Quiney to find out whether
G64 1000  7    the money had been paid and, if not, to send to the
G64 1010  5    lodging of Sir Edward and entreat him to pay what he
G64 1020  2    owed. Baker added: "I pray you delivre these inclosed
G64 1020 11    Letters And Comend mee to **f Rychard mytton whoe I
G64 1030 10    know will ffreind mee for the payment of this monei".
G64 1040  8    Further letters in November mention that Sir Edward
G64 1050  4    paid forty pounds.
G64 1050  7       Stratford's petition to the queen declared that
G64 1060  6    two great fires had burnt two hundred houses in the
G64 1070  4    town, with household goods, to the value of twelve
G64 1070 13    thousand pounds. The chancellor of the Exchequer wrote
G64 1080  8    on the petition: "in myn opinion it is very resonable
G64 1090  8    and conscionable for hir maiestie to graunt in relief
G64 1100  5    of this towne twise afflicted and almost wasted by
G64 1110  2    fire". The queen agreed on December 17, a warrant was
G64 1110 12    signed on January 27, and the Exchequer paid Quiney
G64 1120  9    his expenses on February 27, 1598/9. He listed what
G64 1130  6    he had spent for "My own diet in London eighteen weeks,
G64 1140  4    in which I was sick a month; my mare at coming up 14
G64 1150  3    days; another I bought there to bring me home 7 weeks;
G64 1160  1    and I was six days going thither and coming homewards;
G64 1160 11    all which cost me at the least @20". He was allowed
G64 1170 10    forty-four pounds in all, including fees to the masters
G64 1180  6    of requests, Mr. Fanshawe of the Exchequer, the solicitor
G64 1190  4    general, and other officials and their clerks. If he
G64 1200  3    borrowed money from Shakespeare or with his help, he
G64 1200 12    would now have been able to repay the loan.
G64 1210  9       Since more is known about Quiney than about any
G64 1220  5    other acquaintance of Shakespeare in Stratford, his
G64 1230  2    career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602. During
G64 1230 13    1598 and 1599 he made "manye Guiftes of myne owne provision
G64 1240 11    bestowed uppon Cowrtiers + others for the better effectinge
G64 1250  8    of our suites in hande". He was in London "searching
G64 1260  6    records for our town's causes" in 1600 with young Henry
G64 1270  6    Sturley, the assistant schoolmaster. When Sir Edward
G64 1280  3    Greville enclosed the town commons on the Bancroft,
G64 1290  1    Quiney and others leveled his hedges on January 21,
G64 1290 10    1600I and were charged with riot by Sir Edward. He
G64 1300  8    also sued them for taking toll of grain at their market.
G64 1310  6    Accompanied by "Master Greene our solicitor" (Thomas
G64 1320  2    Greene of the Middle Temple, Shakespeare's "cousin"),
G64 1330  1    Quiney tried to consult Sir Edward Coke, attorney general,
G64 1340  1    and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper "that we
G64 1340 12    might have access to their master for his counsel ...
G64 1350  9    butt colde nott have him att Leasure by the reason
G64 1360  6    of thees trobles" (the Essex rising on February 8).
G64 1370  2    He set down that "I gave **f Greene a pynte of muskadell
G64 1380  1    and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have
G64 1380 13    his company to Master Attorney". After returning to
G64 1390  7    Stratford he drew up a defense of the town's right
G64 1400  5    to toll corn and the office of collecting it, and his
G64 1410  3    list of suggested witnesses included his father and
G64 1410 11    Shakespeare's father. No one, he wrote, took any corn
G64 1420  9    of Greville's, for his bailiff of husbandry "swore
G64 1430  6    a greate oathe thatt who soe came to put hys hande
G64 1440  5    into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande
G64 1450  1    be hynde hym". Quiney was in London again in June,
G64 1450 11    1601, and in November, when he rode up, as Shakespeare
G64 1460  8    must often have done, by way of Oxford, High Wycombe,
G64 1470  5    and Uxbridge, and home through Aylesbury and Banbury.
G64 1480  3       After Quiney was elected bailiff in September, 1601,
G64 1490  2    without Greville's approval, Greene wrote him that
G64 1490  9    Coke had promised to be of counsel for Stratford and
G64 1500 10    had advised "that the office of bayly may be exercised
G64 1510  8    as it is taken upon you, (**f Edwardes his consent
G64 1520  3    not beinge hadd to the swearinge of you)". Asked by
G64 1530  1    the townsmen to cease his suit, Greville had answered
G64 1530 10    that "hytt shulde coste hym **f first + sayed it must
G64 1540 10    be tried ether before my Lorde Anderson in the countrey
G64 1550  5    or his uncle ffortescue in the exchequer with whom
G64 1560  3    he colde more prevaile then we". The corporation proposed
G64 1570  1    Chief Justice Anderson for an arbiter, sending him
G64 1570  9    a gift of sack and claret. Lady Greville, daughter
G64 1580  6    of the late Lord Chancellor Bromley and niece of Sir
G64 1590  6    John Fortescue, was offered twenty pounds by the townsmen
G64 1600  4    to make peace; she "labored + thought she shuld effecte"
G64 1610  2    it but her husband said that "we shuld wynne it by
G64 1610 13    the sworde". His servant Robin Whitney threatened Quiney,
G64 1620  7    who had Whitney bound to "the good abaringe" to keep
G64 1630  8    the peace. A report of **f Edw: Grevyles minaces to
G64 1640  6    the Baileefe Aldermen + Burgesses of Stratforde" tells
G64 1650  4    how Quiney was injured by Greville's men: "in the tyme
G64 1660  4    **f Ryc' Quyney was bayleefe ther came some of them
G64 1670  2    whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts
G64 1670 11    howse wher thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the
G64 1680  9    hoste: att a faier tyme the Baileefe being late abroade
G64 1690  5    to see the towne in order + comminge by in **f hurley
G64 1700  3    Burley. came into the howse + commawnded the peace
G64 1700 12    to be kept butt colde nott prevayle + in hys endevor
G64 1710 10    to sticle the brawle had his heade grevouselye brooken

G64 1730  4    [Greville] punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished
G64 1740  1    but with a shewe to turne them awaye + enterteyned
G64 1740 11    agayne".
