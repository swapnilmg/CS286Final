K23 0010  1    It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews
K23 0010 12    had not been to see her for ten years, not since their
K23 0020 10    last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak
K23 0030  4    being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside from
K23 0040  2    due notification of certain major events in their lives
K23 0040 11    (two marriages, two births, one divorce), Christmas
K23 0050  6    and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the
K23 0060  6    only thin link she had with them through the widowed
K23 0070  3    years. Her thoughts were not discrete. But there was
K23 0080  1    a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons.
K23 0080 12       She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin
K23 0090  9    body upright, like a bird alert for flight. She turned
K23 0100  6    and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged
K23 0110  3    escritoire, warped and cracked now from fifty years
K23 0110 11    in an atmosphere of sea spray. There she extracted
K23 0120  9    two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters, one
K23 0130  7    to Abel, one to Mark.
K23 0130 12       Once her trembling hand, with the pen grasped tight
K23 0140  9    in it, was pressed against the paper the words came
K23 0150  6    sharply, smoothly, as authoritatively as they would
K23 0160  3    dropping from her own lips. And the stiffly regal look
K23 0160 13    of them, she saw grimly, lacked the quaver of age which,
K23 0170 11    thwarting the efforts of her amazing will, ran through
K23 0180  7    her spoken words like a thin ragged string. "Please
K23 0190  3    come down as soon as you conveniently can", the upright
K23 0200  3    letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen, "I have
K23 0200 12    an important matter to discuss with you". To Abel:
K23 0210  9    "I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children
K23 0220  9    here. I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements
K23 0230  7    for your daughters. You may stay as long as you wish,
K23 0240  6    of course, but if arranging for the care of the girls
K23 0250  2    must take time into account, I think a day or two should
K23 0250 14    be enough to finish our business in". To Mark: "Please
K23 0260  9    give my regards to Myra".
K23 0270  3       She signed the letters quickly, stamped them, and
K23 0280  1    placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in
K23 0280 12    town. Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely
K23 0290  9    adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water.
K23 0300  5       "My nephews will be coming down", she said that
K23 0310  3    evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining
K23 0310 12    room, the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray.
K23 0320 10    She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which
K23 0330  5    had paled with the years; from the early evening lights
K23 0340  4    of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her
K23 0350  2    in an uncousinly way, they had faded to a near-absence
K23 0350 13    of color which had, possibly from her constant looking
K23 0360  7    at the water, something of the light of the sea in
K23 0370  7    them.
K23 0370  8       Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a
K23 0380  5    flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth. She smiled,
K23 0390  1    and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive
K23 0390 10    face. "That will be so nice for you, Mrs. Packard",
K23 0400  9    she said. Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth
K23 0410  7    flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm
K23 0420  3    curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose.
K23 0430  1       "Um", said the old lady, and brought her eyes down
K23 0430 10    to the tray. "You remember them, I suppose"? She glinted
K23 0440  8    suspiciously at the dish before her: "Blowfish. I hope
K23 0450  7    Raphael bought them whole".
K23 0460  1       Angelina stepped back, her eyes roaming the tray
K23 0460  9    for omissions. Then she looked at the old woman again,
K23 0470  9    her eyes calm.
K23 0480  1       "Yes", she said, "I remember that they came here
K23 0480  9    every summer. I used to play with the older one sometimes,
K23 0490 10    when he'd let me. Abel"? The name fell with lazy affectionate
K23 0500  7    remembrance from her lips. For an instant the old aunt
K23 0510  7    felt something indefinable flash through her smile.
K23 0520  3    She would have said triumph. Then Angelina turned and
K23 0530  1    with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen.
K23 0530  9       Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the
K23 0540  7    retreating figure, her eyes resting nearly closed on
K23 0550  4    the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips.
K23 0560  1    For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway;
K23 0560 12    then she snorted and groped for her fork.
K23 0570  6       There's no greater catastrophe in the universe,
K23 0580  4    she reflected dourly, impaling tender green beans on
K23 0590  2    the silver fork, than the dwindling away of a family.
K23 0590 12    Procreation, expansion, proliferation- these are the
K23 0600  6    laws of living things, with the penalty for not obeying
K23 0610  6    them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion. When the
K23 0620  3    fate of the individual is visited on the group, then
K23 0620 13    (the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling
K23 0630  9    fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently),
K23 0640  5    ah, then the true bitterness of existence could be
K23 0650  4    tasted. And indeed the young garden beans were brackish
K23 0660  1    in her mouth.
K23 0660  4       She was the last living of the older generation.
K23 0670  1    What had once been a widespread family- at one time,
K23 0670 11    she knew, there were enough Packards to populate an
K23 0680  8    entire county- had now narrowed down to the two boys,
K23 0690  7    Abel and Mark. She swung her eyes up to the blue of
K23 0700  5    the window, her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans.
K23 0710  1    What hope lay in the nephews, she asked the intensifying
K23 0710 11    light out there, with one married to a barren woman
K23 0720  8    and the other divorced, having sired two girl children,
K23 0730  5    with none to bear on the Packard name?
K23 0740  1       She ate. It seemed to her, as it seemed each night,
K23 0740 12    that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at
K23 0750  8    the table's empty chairs, giving her the frequent illusion
K23 0760  6    that she dined with shadows. Here, too, she talked
K23 0770  3    low, quirking her head at one or another of the places,
K23 0780  1    most often at Izaak's armchair which faced her across
K23 0780 10    the long table. Or it might have been the absent nephews
K23 0790  9    she addressed, consciously playing with the notion
K23 0800  5    that this was one of the summers of their early years.
K23 0820  2       She thought again of her children, those two who
K23 0820 11    had died young, before the later science which might
K23 0830  9    have saved them could attach even a label to their
K23 0840  7    separate malignancies. The girl, her first, she barely
K23 0850  4    remembered. It could have been anyone's infant, for
K23 0860  1    it had not survived the bassinet. But the boy ... the
K23 0860 12    boy had been alive yesterday. Each successive movement
K23 0870  6    in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside
K23 0880  6    her. He ran on his plump sticks of legs, freezing now
K23 0900  3    and again into the sudden startled attitudes which
K23 0900 11    the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs,
K23 0910 10    all carefully placed and glued and labeled, resting
K23 0920  6    in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the
K23 0930  4    escritoire. In the cruel clearness of her memory the
K23 0940  1    boy remained unchanged, quick with the delight of laughter,
K23 0940 10    and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed
K23 0950  8    childhood was still unendurable to her. It was one
K23 0960  6    with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those
K23 0970  3    days when she hated the sea.
K23 0970  9    ##
K23 0970 10    The brothers drove down together in Mark's small red
K23 0980  7    sports car, Mark at the wheel. They rarely spoke. Abel
K23 0990  4    sat and regarded the farm country which, spreading
K23 1000  1    out from both sides of the road, rolled greenly up
K23 1000 11    to where the silent white houses and long barns and
K23 1010  8    silos nested into the tilled fields. He saw the land
K23 1020  5    with a stranger's eyes, all the old familiarness gone.
K23 1030  2    And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger,
K23 1040  1    impervious, complete in itself. There was stability
K23 1040  8    there, too- a color which his life had had once. That
K23 1050  9    is what childhood is, he told himself. Solid, settled
K23 1060  4    ... lost. In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone
K23 1070  2    poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's
K23 1080  1    letter. What bad grace, what incredible selfishness
K23 1080  8    he and Mark had shown. The boyhood summers preceding
K23 1090  7    their uncle's funeral might never have been. They had
K23 1100  6    closed over, absolutely, with the sealing of old Izaak's
K23 1110  4    grave. The small car flew on relentlessly. The old
K23 1120  1    woman, stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing
K23 1120 10    waters took on an ominous reality. Abel moved and adjusted
K23 1130  9    his long legs.
K23 1140  1       "I suppose it has to do with the property", Mark
K23 1140 11    had said over the telephone when they had discussed
K23 1150  7    their receipt of the letters. Not until the words had
K23 1160  6    been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and
K23 1170  2    the insistent sea, and feel his contrition blotted
K23 1170 10    out in one shameful moment of covetousness. He and
K23 1180  7    Mark were the last of the family, and there lay the
K23 1190  5    Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end,
K23 1200  2    stretching from horizon to horizon, in those golden
K23 1200 10    days of summer.
K23 1210  1       Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother.
K23 1210 11    Mark held the wheel loosely, but his fingers curved
K23 1220  8    around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set
K23 1230  6    of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in
K23 1240  3    the years to come. His sandy hair was already beginning
K23 1250  1    to thin and recede at the sides, and Abel looked quickly
K23 1250 12    away. Mark easily looked years older than himself,
K23 1260  7    settled, his world comfortably categorized.
K23 1270  2       The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they
K23 1280  1    approached the sea. "She didn't mention bringing Myra",
K23 1280  9    Mark said, maneuvering the car into the next lane.
K23 1290  9    "She's probably getting old- crotchety, I mean- and
K23 1300  7    we figured uh-uh, better not. They've never met, you
K23 1310  5    know. But Myra wouldn't budge without an express invitation.
K23 1320  4    I feel kind of bad about it". He gave Abel a quick
K23 1330  3    glance and moved closer to the wheel, hugging it to
K23 1330 13    him, and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to
K23 1340  8    guilt.
K23 1340  9       "I imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much",
K23 1350  8    Mark added, his eyes on the road. Abel ignored the
K23 1360  5    half-expressed bid for confirmation. He smiled. It
K23 1370  2    was barely possible that his brother was right.
K23 1370 10       He could tell they were approaching the sea. The
K23 1380  8    air took on a special strength now that they'd left
K23 1390  5    the fecund warmth of the farmland behind. There was
K23 1400  3    the smell of the coast, like a primeval memory, composed
K23 1410  1    of equal parts salt water, clams, seaweed and northern
K23 1410 10    air. He turned from the flying trees to look ahead
K23 1420  8    and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone
K23 1430  5    house which, built on one of the many acres of ancestral
K23 1440  3    land bordering the west harbor, had been Izaak's bride-gift
K23 1450  1    to his cousin-wife as the last century ended.
K23 1450 10       Mark's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace
K23 1460  8    beside his own, climbing the same crags in dirty white
K23 1470  7    sneakers, clambering out on top of the headland and
K23 1480  3    coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant.
K23 1490  1    "Remember the Starbird?" Mark asked, and Abel lifted
K23 1490  9    his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the
K23 1500 11    road, the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed
K23 1510  6    rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came
K23 1520  5    down.
K23 1520  6       "The Starbird," Abel said. There was the day Uncle
K23 1530  5    Izaak had, in an unexpected grandiose gesture, handed
K23 1540  2    over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps, on condition
K23 1540 12    that he never fail to let his brother accompany him
K23 1550 10    whenever the younger boy wished. The two of them had
K23 1560  7    developed into a remarkable sailing team ... all of
K23 1570  4    this happening in a time of their lives when their
K23 1570 14    youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as
K23 1580  8    no other time or circumstance could. They seemed then
K23 1590  5    to have had a single mind and body, a mutuality which
K23 1600  3    had been accepted with the fact of their youth, casually.
K23 1610  1    He saw the Starbird as she lay, her slender mast up
K23 1610 12    and gently turning, its point describing constant languid
K23 1620  7    circles against a cumulus sky. Both of them had known
K23 1630  7    the feeling of the small life in her waiting, ready,
K23 1640  3    for the two of them to run up her sails. The Starbird
K23 1650  1    had been long at the bottom of the bay.
K23 1650 10       They came unexpectedly upon the sea. Meeting it
K23 1660  6    without preparation as they did, robbed of anticipation,
K23 1670  3    a common disappointment seized them. They were climbing
K23 1680  2    the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly
K23 1680 11    probed solid blackness, became two parallel luminous
K23 1690  6    tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light
K23 1700  6    and ended. Mark stopped the car and switched off the
K23 1710  3    lights and they sat looking at the water, which, there
K23 1710 13    being no moon out, at first could be distinguished
K23 1720  9    from the sky only by an absence of stars.
