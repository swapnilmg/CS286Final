G29 0010  1       SOME years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience
G29 0010 10    made up of members of the British Association for the
G29 0020 10    Advancement of Science that "man's supernormal or extra-sensory
G29 0030  8    faculties are [now] in the same case as were his mathematical
G29 0040  9    faculties during the ice age". As a Humanist, Dr. Huxley
G29 0050  7    interests himself in the possibilities of human development,
G29 0060  4    and one thing we can say about this suggestion, which
G29 0070  3    comes from a leading zoologist, is that, so far as
G29 0070 13    he is concerned, the scientific outlook places no rigid
G29 0080  9    limitation upon the idea of future human evolution.
G29 0090  7       This text from Dr. Huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts
G29 0100  6    to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists
G29 0110  4    to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic
G29 0120  3    powers in human beings. There may be a case of this
G29 0120 14    sort, but it is not one we wish to argue, here. Even
G29 0130 12    if people do, in a not far distant future, begin to
G29 0140  7    read one another's minds, there will still be the question
G29 0150  5    of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially
G29 0160  3    worth reading- worth more, that is, than what you can
G29 0170  1    read in good books. Even if men eventually find themselves
G29 0170 11    able to look through walls and around corners, one
G29 0180  8    may question whether this will help them to live better
G29 0190  7    lives. There would be side-conclusions to be drawn,
G29 0200  4    of course; such capacities are impressive evidence
G29 0200 11    pointing to a conception of the human being which does
G29 0210 10    not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic
G29 0220  5    evolutionists; but the basic puzzles of existence would
G29 0230  4    still be puzzling, and we should still have to work
G29 0240  1    out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this
G29 0240 12    article.
G29 0250  1       All we want from Dr. Huxley's statement is the feeling
G29 0250 11    that this is an open world, in the view of the best
G29 0260 11    scientific opinion, with practically no directional
G29 0270  4    commitments as to what may happen next, and no important
G29 0280  3    confinements with respect to what may be possible.
G29 0290  1       It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult
G29 0290 10    tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man
G29 0300  8    is not one, but many. Each man, that is, is both one
G29 0310  6    and many. He is a dreamer of the good society with
G29 0320  1    a plan to put into effect, and he is an individual
G29 0320 12    craftsman with something to make for himself and the
G29 0330  8    people of his time. He is a parent with a child to
G29 0340  5    nurture, here and now, and he is an educator who worries
G29 0350  1    about the children half way round the world. He is
G29 0350 11    a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable
G29 0360 10    human made captive by the circumstances of today. He
G29 0370  5    can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice
G29 0380  4    tomorrow for himself. He is a Craig's wife who agonizes
G29 0390  1    about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is
G29 0390 12    a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker
G29 0400  9    when dignitaries from the local university have come
G29 0410  5    to call. He is the stern guardian of the status quo
G29 0420  2    who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age,
G29 0420 11    and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his
G29 0430 10    hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for
G29 0440  5    the men he has killed.
G29 0440 10       What will be the final symmetry of the good society?
G29 0450  8    For what do the utopians labor? Here, on a desk, is
G29 0460  7    a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some
G29 0470  3    of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions.
G29 0480  1    The pamphlets are about law, the corporation, forms
G29 0480  9    of government, the idea of freedom, the defense of
G29 0490  7    liberty, the various lethargies which overtake our
G29 0500  3    major institutions, the gap between traditional social
G29 0510  1    ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set
G29 0510 10    in motion for their realization. The thing that is
G29 0520  6    notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological
G29 0530  5    ardor. There is another kind of ardor, a quiet, sure
G29 0540  2    devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life,
G29 0540 10    but no angry utopian contentions. Actually, you could
G29 0550  7    wish for some passion, now and then, but when you look
G29 0560  8    around the world and see the little volcanos of current
G29 0570  3    history which partisan social passions have wrought,
G29 0580  1    you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least
G29 0580 12    some civilized calm.
G29 0590  2       You could also say that in these pamphlets is a
G29 0590 12    relieving quality of maturity. There is essential pleasantness
G29 0600  8    in reading the writing of men who are not angry, who
G29 0610  9    can contend without quarreling. This is the good kind
G29 0620  6    of sophistication, and with all our problems and crises
G29 0630  3    this kind of sophistication has flowered in the United
G29 0630 12    States during recent years. A characteristic expression
G29 0640  7    of such concern and inquiry is found in Joseph P. Lyford's
G29 0650  9    introduction to The Agreeable Autocracies, a recent
G29 0660  5    paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic
G29 0670  4    society. Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents,
G29 0680  3    we think, an achieved plateau of reflective thinking.
G29 0690  1    After casting about for a way of describing this spirit,
G29 0690 11    we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford's
G29 0700 10    introduction as an illustration. He begins: "
G29 0710  5       At one time it seemed as if the Soviet Union had
G29 0720  5    done us a favor by providing a striking example of
G29 0730  2    how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations.
G29 0730 12    As things turned out, however, we have not profited
G29 0740  9    greatly from the lesson: instead of persistently following
G29 0750  5    a national program of our own we have often been satisfied
G29 0760  6    to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at
G29 0770  4    the moment. Such activity may or may not have irritated
G29 0780  1    the Kremlin, but it has frequently condemned America
G29 0780  9    to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our
G29 0790  6    effort to give leadership to the free world.
G29 0800  3       The defensiveness has been exaggerated by another
G29 0810  1    bad habit, our tendency to rate the "goodness" or "badness"
G29 0820  1    of other nations by the extent to which they applaud
G29 0820 11    the slogans we circulate about ourselves. Since the
G29 0830  5    slogans have little application to reality and are
G29 0840  4    sanctimonious to boot, the applause is faint even in
G29 0840 13    areas of the world where we should expect to find the
G29 0850 11    greatest affection for free government. Shocked at
G29 0860  6    the response to our proclamations, we grow more defensive,
G29 0870  5    and worse, we lose our sense of humor and proportion.
G29 0880  1    Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism
G29 0880 10    by our Department of State, and an American President
G29 0890  9    observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less
G29 0900  8    neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic".
G29 0910  2       One thing you can say about Mr. Lyford is that he
G29 0920  3    does not suffer from any insecurity as an American.
G29 0920 12    Those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination.
G29 0930 11    Only the strong look squarely at weakness. The maturity
G29 0940  7    in this point of view lies in its recognition that
G29 0950  5    no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly
G29 0960  2    understood. Mr. Lyford continues: "
G29 0960  6       Even if the self portrait we distribute for popular
G29 0970  7    consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to
G29 0980  5    present it as a picture of the ideal society. We would
G29 0990  2    be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries.
G29 0990 10    The picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents
G29 1000  9    the facts of American life. The discrepancy between
G29 1010  5    what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate
G29 1020  5    is great, and it does not escape the notice of others.
G29 1030  3    If our sincerity is granted, and it is granted, the
G29 1030 13    discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that
G29 1040  9    we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves
G29 1050  6    in preference to an understanding gained by earnest
G29 1060  4    self-examination. What is more, the legends have become
G29 1070  1    so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination
G29 1070 10    or self-criticism smells of low treason, and men who
G29 1080  8    practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels.
G29 1090  3       ... although we continue to pay our conversational
G29 1100  2    devotions to "free private enterprise", "individual
G29 1110  1    initiative", "the democratic way", "government of the
G29 1110  8    people", "competition of the marketplace", etc., we
G29 1120  7    live rather comfortably in a society in which economic
G29 1130  7    competition is diminishing in large areas, bureaucracy
G29 1140  4    is corroding representative government, technology
G29 1150  1    is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power
G29 1150 10    to make decisions, and the threat of war is driving
G29 1160  9    him economically and physically into the ground".
G29 1170  4       The interesting thing about Mr. Lyford's approach,
G29 1180  3    and the approach of the contributors to The Agreeable
G29 1190  2    Autocracies (Oceana Publications, 1961) to the situation
G29 1200  1    of American civilization, is that it is concerned with
G29 1200 10    comprehending the psychological relationships which
G29 1210  5    are having a decisive effect on American life. In an
G29 1220  6    ideological argument, the participants tend to thump
G29 1230  3    the table. They are determined to prove something.
G29 1230 11    The new spirit, so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford's
G29 1240  9    work, is wholly free of this anxiety. The problem is
G29 1250  8    rather to find out what is actually happening, and
G29 1260  3    this is especially difficult for the reason that "we
G29 1270  1    are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present,
G29 1270 11    sometimes by the very agencies- our educational system,
G29 1280  8    our mass media, our statesmen- on which we have had
G29 1290  6    to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves".
G29 1300  3    The Introduction continues: "
G29 1300  6       We experience a vague uneasiness about events, a
G29 1310  7    suspicion that our political and economic institutions,
G29 1320  4    like the genie in the bottle, have escaped confinement
G29 1330  2    and that we have lost the power to recall them. We
G29 1330 13    feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation
G29 1340  8    or a union or a television set, but until we have some
G29 1350  7    knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing
G29 1360  5    to us, we can hardly learn to control them. It does
G29 1370  1    not appear that we will be delivered from our situation
G29 1370 11    by articles on The National Purpose.
G29 1380  5       The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore
G29 1390  6    some of the institutions which both reflect and determine
G29 1400  3    the character of the free society today. The men who
G29 1410  1    speculate on these institutions have, for the most
G29 1410  9    part, come to at least one common conclusion: that
G29 1420  5    many of the great enterprises and associations around
G29 1430  2    which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic
G29 1440  1    in nature, and possessed of power which can be used
G29 1440 11    to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his
G29 1450  9    individuality in the modern world".
G29 1460  2       These institutions which Mr. Lyford names "agreeable
G29 1470  1    autocracies"- where did they come from? Of one thing
G29 1470  9    we can be sure: they were not sketched out by the revolutionary
G29 1480 12    theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated
G29 1490  7    the political principles and originally shaped the
G29 1500  5    political institutions of what we term the "free society".
G29 1510  2    No doubt there are historians who can explain to a
G29 1520  1    great extent what happened to the plans and projects
G29 1520 10    of the eighteenth century. Going back over this ground
G29 1530  7    and analyzing the composition of forces which have
G29 1540  5    created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken
G29 1550  1    by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions,
G29 1550 10    in Santa Barbara. But however we come, finally, to
G29 1560  9    explain and account for the present, the truth we are
G29 1570  8    trying to expose, right now, is that the makers of
G29 1580  4    constitutions and the designers of institutions find
G29 1590  1    it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior
G29 1590 10    of the host of all their enterprises. The host is the
G29 1600  9    flowing life of the human race. This life has its own
G29 1610  6    currents and rhythms, its own multiple cycles and adaptations.
G29 1620  3    On occasion it produces extraordinary novelties. Should
G29 1630  2    Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social
G29 1630 12    theory for the advent of television, atomic energy,
G29 1640  8    and IBM machines? How would Thomas Jefferson feel
G29 1650  6    after reading Factories in the Field? They tell us,
G29 1660  5    sir, that we are free, because we have in one hand
G29 1670  2    a ballot, and in the other a stock certificate. With
G29 1670 12    these we shape our destiny and own private property,
G29 1680  8    and that, sir, makes ours the best of all possible
G29 1690  6    societies. The reality of the situation, however, is
G29 1700  2    described by Mr. Lyford: "
G29 1700  6       Many of us may even be secretly relieved at having
G29 1710  6    a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities
G29 1720  3    to a new bureaucracy of experts. Thus the member of
G29 1730  2    an industrial union comes to regard his officers as
G29 1730 11    business agents who may proceed without interference
G29 1740  7    or recall; the stockholder delivers his proxy; and
G29 1750  5    the citizen narrows his political participation to
G29 1760  2    the mere act of voting- if he votes at all".
