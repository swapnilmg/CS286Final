K02 0010  1    Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves
K02 0010 10    thrusting themselves upward in angry motion, Papa-san
K02 0020  7    sat glacier-like, his smooth solidity, his very immobility
K02 0030  4    defying all the turmoil about him. "Our objective",
K02 0040  2    the colonel had said that day of the briefing, "is
K02 0040 12    Papa-san". There the objective sat, brooding over all.
K02 0050  8    Gouge, burn, blast, insult it as they would, could
K02 0060  8    anyone really take Papa-san?
K02 0070  1       Between the ponderous hulk and himself, in the valley
K02 0070 10    over which Papa-san reigned, men had hidden high explosives,
K02 0080  9    booby traps, and mines. The raped valley was a pregnant
K02 0090  8    womb awaiting abortion. On the forward slope in front
K02 0100  6    of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire.
K02 0110  2    At the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out
K02 0110 11    of eye range like a wild tangle of children's hoops,
K02 0120  9    stopped simultaneously, weirdly poised as if awaiting
K02 0130  6    the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling
K02 0140  5    again. Closer still, regular barricades of barbed wire
K02 0150  2    hung on timber supports. Was it all vain labor? Who
K02 0150 12    would clean up the mess when the war was over? Smiling
K02 0160 11    at his quixotic thoughts, Warren turned back from the
K02 0170  7    opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down. Tonight
K02 0180  4    a group of men, tomorrow night he himself, would go
K02 0190  3    out there somewhere and wait. If he were to go with
K02 0190 14    White, he would be out there two days, not just listening
K02 0200 11    in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san,
K02 0210  7    but moving ever deeper into enemy land- behind Papa-san
K02 0220  4    itself. Was this what he had expected? He hadn't realized
K02 0230  3    that there would be so much time to think, so many
K02 0240  1    lulls. Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been
K02 0240 11    told, that combat was an intermittent activity. Now
K02 0250  6    he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on
K02 0260  5    the train would have to be approached. It could take
K02 0270  2    place tomorrow night, or it might occur months from
K02 0270 11    now. There was just too much time. Time to become afraid.
K02 0280 10    White's suggestion flattered, but he did not like the
K02 0290  8    identity. He did not spill over with hatred for the
K02 0300  4    enemy. He hadn't even seen him yet ...
K02 0300 12       Pressing his cigarette out in the earth, Warren
K02 0310  8    walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills. He
K02 0320  6    saw no life, but still stood there for a time peering
K02 0330  4    at the unlovely hills, his gaze continually returning
K02 0330 12    to Papa-san. He had come here in order to test himself.
K02 0340 12    While most of his beliefs were still unsettled, he
K02 0350  7    knew that he did not believe in killing. Yet, he was
K02 0360  5    here. He had come because he could not live out his
K02 0370  2    life feeling that he had been a coward.
K02 0370 10    ##
K02 0370 11    There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot
K02 0380  7    led out that next night. The beaming ROK was carrying
K02 0390  5    a thirty-caliber machine gun; another man lugged the
K02 0400  4    tripod and a box of ammunition. Warren and White each
K02 0410  1    carried, in addition to their own weapons and ammo,
K02 0410 10    a box of ammo for the ROK's machine gun. Others carried
K02 0420  7    extra clips for the Browning Automatic Rifle, which
K02 0430  5    was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez.
K02 0440  3    Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon.
K02 0450  1    "We just sit quiet and wait", Prevot had said. "Be
K02 0450 11    sure the man nearest you is awake. If Joe doesn't show
K02 0460 10    up, we'll all be back here at 0600 hours. Otherwise,
K02 0470  7    we hold a reception. Then we pull out under our mortar
K02 0480  5    and artillery cover, but nobody pulls out until I say
K02 0490  3    so. Remember what I said about going out to get anybody
K02 0490 14    left behind? That still holds. We bring back all dead
K02 0500 10    and wounded".
K02 0510  1       At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed
K02 0510 10    wire at the point of departure. Then began the journey
K02 0520  8    through their own mine fields. Mines. Ours were kinder
K02 0530  5    than theirs, some said. They set bouncing betties to
K02 0540  3    jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully
K02 0550  1    had them go off at the head. Mines. Big ones and little.
K02 0550 13    The crude wooden boxes of the enemy, our nicely turned
K02 0560  9    gray metal disks. But theirs defied the detectors.
K02 0570  5    Mines. A foot misplaced, a leg missing. Mines. All
K02 0580  3    sizes: big ones, some wired to set off a whole field,
K02 0590  1    little ones, hand grenade size. Booby traps to fill
K02 0590 10    the head with chunks of metal. Warren tried to shake
K02 0600  8    off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky.
K02 0610  5    It was dark. Prevot had said that the searchlights
K02 0620  1    would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours, "which
K02 0620 11    gives us time to get settled in position".
K02 0630  6       Because they were new men and to be sure that they
K02 0640  6    didn't get lost, Prevot had placed Warren and White
K02 0650  3    in the center of the patrol as it filed out. His eyes
K02 0650 15    now fixed on White's solid figure, Warren could hear
K02 0660  9    behind him the tread of another. He could also hear
K02 0670  7    the stream which he had seen from his position. They
K02 0680  4    were going to follow it for part of their journey.
K02 0690  1    "It's safe", Prevot had said, "and it provides cover
K02 0690 10    for our noise".
K02 0700  2       Soon they were picking their way along the edge
K02 0700 11    of the stream which glowed in the night. On their right
K02 0710 11    rose the embankment covered with brush and trees. If
K02 0720  7    a branch extended out too far, each man held it back
K02 0730  6    for the next, and if they met a low overhang, each
K02 0740  1    warned the other. Thus, stealthily they advanced upstream;
K02 0740  9    then they turned to the right, climbed the embankment,
K02 0750  9    and walked into the valley again. There was no cover
K02 0760  7    here, only grass sighing against pant-legs. And with
K02 0770  5    each sigh, like a whip in the hand of an expert, the
K02 0780  2    grass stripped something from Warren. The gentle whir
K02 0780 10    of each footstep left him more naked than before, until
K02 0790  8    he felt his unprotected flesh tremble, chilled by each
K02 0800  6    new sound. The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked
K02 0810  4    solidity, as if the whip had stripped them of their
K02 0810 14    very flesh. The dark forms moved like mourners on some
K02 0820 10    nocturnal pilgrimage, their dirge unsung for want of
K02 0830  7    vocal chords. The warped, broken trees in the valley
K02 0840  5    assumed wraith-like shapes. Clumps of brush that they
K02 0850  2    passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger
K02 0860  3    to tear and gnaw on his bones. Looming over all, Papa-san
K02 0870  1    leered down at him, threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies.
K02 0870 10    Off in the distance a searchlight flashed on, its beam
K02 0880  9    slashing the sky. The sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud,
K02 0890  8    then reflected to the earth in a softer, diffused radiance.
K02 0900  4    Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light.
K02 0910  3    Warren thought of all the men out that night who, like
K02 0920  1    himself, had left their protective ridge and- fear
K02 0920  9    working at their guts- picked their way into the area
K02 0930  7    beyond. From the east to the west coast of the Korean
K02 0940  5    peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled
K02 0950  1    men were at that same moment furtively crawling through
K02 0950 10    the night, sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement
K02 0960  8    or sound, or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes
K02 0970  5    and muzzle blasts. White's arm went up and Warren raised
K02 0980  5    his own. The patrol was stopping.
K02 0980 11       Prevot came up "Take that spot over there", he whispered,
K02 0990 10    pointing to a small clump of blackness. "Give me your
K02 1000  9    machine gun ammo". Warren handed him the metal box
K02 1010  6    and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line.
K02 1020  2       Lying in the grass behind the brush clump, Warren
K02 1020 11    looked about. The others likewise had hidden themselves
K02 1030  8    in the grass and the brush. Over his shoulder he could
K02 1040  8    see Prevot with the machine gun crew. Even at this
K02 1050  5    short distance they were only vague shapes, setting
K02 1060  1    up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could
K02 1060 13    fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol.
K02 1070  8       Warren eased his rifle's safety off and gently,
K02 1080  5    slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one
K02 1090  2    of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part
K02 1090 11    of his body with an X. This he placed within quick
K02 1100  8    reach. The walk and his fears had served to overheat
K02 1110  5    him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the
K02 1120  3    night air. Although the armored vest fitted the upper
K02 1120 12    part of his body snugly, he felt no security. Figures
K02 1130 10    seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark; in the distance
K02 1140  7    he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat
K02 1150  5    even as he watched. Certain this menace was only imaginary,
K02 1160  3    he yet stared in fascinated horror, his hand sticky
K02 1160 12    against the stock of his weapon. He was aware of insistent
K02 1170 11    inner beatings, as if prisoners within sought release
K02 1180  7    from his rigid body.
K02 1190  1       Above, the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight
K02 1190  8    pointed at the clouds, diluting the valley's dark to
K02 1200  6    a pallid light. Then the figures which held his attention
K02 1210  5    became a group of shattered trees, standing like the
K02 1220  3    grotesques of a medieval damnation scene. Even so,
K02 1220 11    he could not ease the tension of his body; the rough
K02 1230 10    surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every
K02 1240  5    attempt on his part to relax. Sensing the unseen presence
K02 1250  3    of the other men in the patrol, he felt mutely united
K02 1260  1    to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint
K02 1260  9    of being with him. He sensed something precious in
K02 1270  6    the perilous moment, something akin to the knowledge
K02 1280  4    gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside,
K02 1290  1    a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness.
K02 1290  6       - In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great
K02 1300  9    stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky, and always
K02 1310  7    as he wandered, he felt a stranger to their exultation.
K02 1320  2    They were poems in a strange language, of which he
K02 1320 12    could barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being
K02 1330 10    ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there.
K02 1340  7    Brittany, that stone-gray mystery through which he
K02 1350  4    traveled for thirty days, sleeping in the barns of
K02 1360  1    farmers or alongside roads, had worked some subtle
K02 1360  9    change in him, he knew, and it was in Brittany that
K02 1370  8    he had met Pierre.
K02 1370 12       Pierre had no hands; they had been severed at the
K02 1380 10    wrists. With leather cups fitted in his handlebars,
K02 1390  5    he steered his bicycle. He and Warren had traveled
K02 1400  2    together for four days. They visited the shipyards
K02 1400 10    at Brest and Pierre had to sign the register, vouching
K02 1410  9    for the integrity of the visiting foreigner. He took
K02 1420  6    the pen in his stumps and began to write.
K02 1430  2       "Wait! Wait"! cried the guard who ran from the hut
K02 1440  2    to shout to other men standing about outside. They
K02 1440 11    crowded the small room and peered over one another's
K02 1450  7    shoulders to watch the handless man write his name
K02 1460  5    in the book.
K02 1460  8       "C'est formidable", they exclaimed.
K02 1470  3       "Mais, oui. C'est merveilleux".
K02 1480  1       And then the questions came, eager, interested questions,
K02 1480  9    and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity.
K02 1490  7       "Doesn't it ever bother you", Warren had asked,
K02 1500  7    "to have people always asking you about your hands"?
K02 1510  5       "Oh, the French are a very curious people", Pierre
K02 1520  3    had laughed. "They are also honest seekers after truth.
K02 1530  3    Now the English are painfully silent about my missing
K02 1540  1    hands. They refuse to mention or to notice that they
K02 1540 11    are not there. The Americans, like yourself, take the
K02 1550  6    fact for granted, try to be helpful, but don't ask
K02 1560  4    questions. I'm used to all three, but I think the French
K02 1570  3    have the healthiest attitude".
K02 1570  7       That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about
K02 1580  7    the Abbey of Solesmes. "You are looking tired and there
K02 1590  6    you can rest. It will be good for you. I think, too",
K02 1600  4    he said, his dark eyes mischievous, "that you will
K02 1610  1    find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals
K02 1610 11    about which you have spoken".
K02 1620  3       Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell at
K02 1630  2    the abbey gate. The monk who opened the door immediately
K02 1630 12    calmed his worries about his reception: "I speak English",
K02 1640  8    the old man said, "but I do not hear it very well".
K02 1650 10    He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs
K02 1660  5    sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help.
K02 1670  3    Smiling at Warren's protestations, the old monk took
K02 1680  1    his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a
K02 1680 13    small parlor. "Will you please wait in here.
