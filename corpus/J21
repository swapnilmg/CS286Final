J21 0010  1    #INTRODUCTION.#
J21 0010  2    In @1 we investigate a new series of line involutions
J21 0020  1    in a projective space of three dimensions over the
J21 0020 10    field of complex numbers. These are defined by a simple
J21 0030  8    involutorial transformation of the points in which
J21 0040  6    a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface
J21 0050  1    bearing a curve of symbol **f. Then in @2 we show that
J21 0050 13    any line involution with the properties that (a) It
J21 0060  8    has no complex of invariant lines, and (b) Its singular
J21 0070  6    lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the
J21 0080  3    lines which meet a twisted curve, is necessarily of
J21 0080 12    the type discussed in @1. No generalization of these
J21 0090  9    results to spaces of more than three dimensions has
J21 0100  7    so far been found possible.
J21 0100 12    #1.#
J21 0110  1    Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli
J21 0110 10    **f and **f, and let \g be a **f curve of order k
J21 0120 13    on Q. A general line l meets Q in two points, **f
J21 0140 10    and **f, through each of which passes a unique generator
J21 0150  8    of the regulus, **f, whose lines are simple secants
J21 0160  5    of \g. On these generators let **f and **f be, respectively,
J21 0170  4    the harmonic conjugates of **f and **f with respect
J21 0180  1    to the two points in which the corresponding generator
J21 0180 10    meets \g. The line **f is the image of l. Clearly,
J21 0190 10    the transformation is involutorial.
J21 0200  3       We observe first that no line, l, can meet its
J21 0210  4    image except at one of its intersections with Q. For
J21 0220  2    if it did, the plane of l and l' would contain two
J21 0230  2    generators of **f, which is impossible. Moreover, from
J21 0230 10    the definitive transformation of intercepts on the
J21 0240  6    generators of **f, it is clear that the only points
J21 0250  5    of Q at which a line can meets its image are the points
J21 0260  4    of \g. Hence the totality of singular lines is the
J21 0270  2    kth order complex of lines which meet \g.
J21 0270 10       The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence
J21 0280  9    of secants of \g, since each of these meets Q in
J21 0290  8    two points which are invariant. The order of this congruence
J21 0300  6    is **f, since **f secants of a curve of symbol (a,b)
J21 0310  3    on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point.
J21 0320  1    The class of the congruence is **f, since an arbitrary
J21 0320 11    plane meets \g in k points.
J21 0330  5       Since the complex of singular lines is of order
J21 0340  5    k and since there is no complex of invariant lines,
J21 0350  2    it follows from the formula **f that the order of the
J21 0350 13    involution is **f.
J21 0360  3       There are various sets of exceptional lines, or
J21 0360 11    lines whose images are not unique. The most obvious
J21 0370  9    of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q,
J21 0380  6    each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil
J21 0390  5    of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of
J21 0400  5    tangency of the given line. Thus pencils of tangents
J21 0410  2    to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents. It
J21 0410 11    is interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established
J21 0420  9    between the lines of two such pencils, so that in a
J21 0430 10    sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each
J21 0440  5    tangent. For the lines of any plane, |p, meeting Q
J21 0450  3    in a conic C, are transformed into the congruence
J21 0460  1    of secants of the curve C' into which C is transformed
J21 0470  2    in the point involution on Q. In particular, tangents
J21 0480  1    to C are transformed into tangents to C'. Moreover,
J21 0490  1    if **f and **f are two planes intersecting in a line
J21 0490 12    l, tangent to Q at a point P, the two free intersections
J21 0500 11    of the image curves **f and **f must coincide at P',
J21 0510 11    the image of P, and at this point **f and **f must
J21 0520 11    have a common tangent l'. Hence, thought of as a line
J21 0530  8    in a particular plane |p, any tangent to Q has a
J21 0540  7    unique image and moreover this image is the same for
J21 0550  5    all planes through l.
J21 0550  9       Each generator, |l, of **f is also exceptional,
J21 0560  7    for each is transformed into the entire congruence
J21 0570  3    of secants of the curve into which that generator is
J21 0580  2    transformed by the point involution on Q. This curve
J21 0580 11    is of symbol **f since it meets |l, and hence every
J21 0590 10    line of **f in the **f invariant points on |l and
J21 0600  7    since it obviously meets every line of **f in a single
J21 0610  6    point. The congruence of its secants is therefore of
J21 0620  2    order **f and class **f.
J21 0620  7       A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable
J21 0630  3    from the following considerations: Since no two generators
J21 0640  2    of **f can intersect, it follows that their image curves
J21 0650  1    can have no free intersections. In other words, these
J21 0650 10    curves have only fixed intersections common to them
J21 0660  6    all. Now the only way in which all curves of the image
J21 0670  5    family of **f can pass through a fixed point is to
J21 0680  2    have a generator of **f which is not a secant but a
J21 0680 14    tangent of \g, for then any point on such a generator
J21 0690  9    will be transformed into the point of tangency. Since
J21 0700  6    two curves of symbol **f on Q intersect in **f points,
J21 0710  4    it follows that there are **f lines of **f which are
J21 0720  2    tangent to \g. Clearly, any line, l, of any bundle
J21 0730  1    having one of these points of tangency, T, as vertex
J21 0730 11    will be transformed into the entire pencil having the
J21 0740  7    image of the second intersection of l and Q as vertex
J21 0750  7    and lying in the plane determined by the image point
J21 0760  5    and the generator of **f which is tangent to \g at
J21 0770  3    T. A line through two of these points, **f and **f,
J21 0780  1    will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence
J21 0780  9    having the tangents to \g at **f and **f as directrices.
J21 0790 10       A conic, C, being a (1, 1) curve on Q, meets the
J21 0800 10    image of any line of **f, which we have already found
J21 0810  8    to be a **f curve on Q, in **f points. Hence its image,
J21 0820  7    C', meets any line of **f in **f points. Moreover,
J21 0830  5    C' obviously meets any line **f in a single point.
J21 0840  4    Hence C' is a **f curve on Q. Therefore, the congruence
J21 0850  3    of its secants, that is the image of a general plane
J21 0860  2    field of lines, is of order **f and class **f. Finally,
J21 0860 13    the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence
J21 0870 10    whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant
J21 0880  6    lines, namely **f and whose class is the order of the
J21 0890  5    image congruence of a general plane field of lines,
J21 0900  1    namely **f.
J21 0900  3    #2.#
J21 0900  4    The preceding observations make it clear that there
J21 0910  1    exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1
J21 0910 10    with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex
J21 0920  8    of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines
J21 0930  4    which meet a twisted curve \g. We now shall show that
J21 0940  3    any involution with these characteristics is necessarily
J21 0950  1    of the type we have just described.
J21 0950  8       To do this we must first show that every line which
J21 0960  6    meets \g in a point P meets its image at P. To see
J21 0970  6    this, consider a general pencil of lines containing
J21 0980  2    a general secant of \G. By (1), the image of this
J21 0980 13    pencil is a ruled surface of order **f which is met
J21 0990 11    by the plane of the pencil in a curve, C, of order
J21 1000  8    **f. On C there is a **f correspondence in which the
J21 1010  6    **f points cut from C by a general line, l, of the
J21 1020  5    pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the
J21 1030  3    image of l and the plane of the pencil. Since C is
J21 1040  2    rational, this correspondence has k coincidences,
J21 1040  8    each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets
J21 1050 11    its image. However, since the pencil contains a secant
J21 1060  7    of \g it actually contains only **f singular lines.
J21 1070  4    To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that C
J21 1080  2    be composite, with the secant of \g and a curve of
J21 1090  1    order **f as components. Thus it follows that the secants
J21 1090 11    of \g are all invariant. But if this is the case,
J21 1100 10    then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point, P,
J21 1110  7    of \g as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface
J21 1120  5    of order **f having **f generators concurrent at P.
J21 1130  2    Since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent
J21 1131  1    generators is necessarily a cone, it follows finally
J21 1140  8    that every line through a point, P, of \g meets its
J21 1150  8    image at P, as asserted.
J21 1160  1       Now consider the transformation of the lines of
J21 1160  9    a bundle with vertex, P, on \g which is effected
J21 1170  9    by the involution as a whole. From the preceding remarks,
J21 1180  8    it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into
J21 1190  4    itself in an involutorial fashion. Moreover, in this
J21 1200  3    involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order
J21 1200 13    **f, namely the cone of secants of \g which pass through
J21 1210 10    P. Hence it follows that the involution within the
J21 1220  8    bundle must be a perspective de Jonquieres involution
J21 1230  4    of order **f and the invariant locus must have a multiple
J21 1240  4    line of multiplicity either **f or **f. The first possibility
J21 1250  1    requires that there be a line through P which meets
J21 1260  1    \g in **f points; the second requires that there be
J21 1260 11    a line through P which meets \g in **f points. In
J21 1270  9    each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by
J21 1280  7    involutions within the pencils they determine with
J21 1290  3    the multiple secant. In the first case the fixed elements
J21 1300  1    within each pencil are the multiple secant and the
J21 1300 10    line joining the vertex, P, to the intersection of
J21 1310  7    \g and the plane of the pencil which does not lie
J21 1320  7    on the multiple secant. In the second, the fixed elements
J21 1330  4    are the lines which join the vertex, P, to the two
J21 1340  3    intersections of \g and the plane of the pencil which
J21 1340 13    do not lie on the multiple secant. The multiple secants,
J21 1350 10    of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed
J21 1360  8    into cones of order **f.
J21 1370  1       Observations similar to these can be made at each
J21 1370 10    point of \g. Hence \g must have either a regulus
J21 1380  8    of **f-fold secants or a regulus of **f-fold secants.
J21 1390  7    Moreover, if **f, no two of the multiple secants can
J21 1400  3    intersect. For if such were the case, either the plane
J21 1410  1    of the two lines would meet \g in more than k points
J21 1410 13    or, alternatively, the order of the image regulus of
J21 1420  9    the pencil determined by the two lines would be too
J21 1430  8    high. But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple
J21 1440  3    secants of \g can intersect, then the regulus must
J21 1450  1    be quadratic, or in other words, \g must be either
J21 1450 11    a **f or a **f curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.
J21 1460  7       We now observe that the case in which \g is a **f
J21 1470  9    curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of
J21 1480  4    singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which
J21 1490  1    meet \g. For any pencil in a plane containing a **f-fold
J21 1490 13    secant of \g has an image regulus which meets the
J21 1500 10    plane of the pencil in **f lines, namely the images
J21 1510  7    of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection
J21 1520  4    of \g and the multiple secant, plus an additional
J21 1530  1    component to account for the intersections of the images
J21 1530 10    of the general lines of the pencil. However, if there
J21 1540 10    is no additional complex of singular lines, the order
J21 1550  6    of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely **f.
J21 1560  3    This contradicts the preceding observations, and so,
J21 1570  1    under the assumption of this paper we must reject the
J21 1570 11    possibility that \g is a **f curve on a quadric surface.
J21 1580 10       Continuing with the case in which \g is a **f curve
J21 1590 10    on a quadric Q, we first observe that the second regulus
J21 1600  6    of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the
J21 1610  6    two free intersections of \g and the planes through
J21 1620  2    any one of the multiple secants. For each of these
J21 1620 12    lines meets Q in three points, namely two points on
J21 1630 10    \g and one point on one of the multiple secants.
J21 1640  8       Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in
J21 1650  6    two points, **f and **f. If |a is the multiple secant
J21 1660  6    of \g which passes through **f and |b is the simple
J21 1670  5    secant of \g which passes through **f, and if **f
J21 1680  3    are the points in which |a meets \g, and if **f is
J21 1680 15    the image of **f on the generator |b, it follows that
J21 1690 11    the image of the line **f is **f.
