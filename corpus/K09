K09 0010  1    It was the first time any of us had laughed since the
K09 0010 13    morning began.
K09 0020  1    ##
K09 0020  2    The rider from Concord was as good as his word. He
K09 0020 13    came spurring and whooping down the road, his horse
K09 0030  8    kicking up clouds of dust, shouting:
K09 0040  2       "They're a-coming! By God, they're a-coming, they
K09 0050  2    are"!
K09 0050  3       We heard him before he ever showed, and we heard
K09 0060  2    him yelling after he was out of sight. Solomon Chandler
K09 0060 12    hadn't misjudged the strength of his lungs, not at
K09 0070  9    all. I think you could have heard him a mile away,
K09 0080  7    and he was bursting at every seam with importance.
K09 0090  2    I have observed that being up on a horse changes the
K09 0090 13    whole character of a man, and when a very small man
K09 0100 11    is up on a saddle, he'd like as not prefer to eat his
K09 0110  8    meals there. That's understandable, and I appreciate
K09 0120  4    the sentiment. As for this rider, I never saw him before
K09 0130  3    or afterwards and never saw him dismounted, so whether
K09 0130 12    he stood tall or short in his shoes, I can't say; but
K09 0140 11    I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction.
K09 0150  8    The last thing in the world that resembled a war was
K09 0160  5    our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics
K09 0170  1    perched on top of a stone wall, and this dashing rider
K09 0170 12    made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to
K09 0180  9    the situation.
K09 0180 11       We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all
K09 0190 11    of us, and we crouched behind it. I have heard people
K09 0200  6    talk with contempt about the British regulars, but
K09 0210  2    that only proves that a lot of people talk about things
K09 0210 13    of which they are deplorably ignorant. Whatever we
K09 0220  8    felt about the redcoats, we respected them in terms
K09 0230  6    of their trade, which was killing; and I know that
K09 0240  4    I, myself, was nauseated with apprehension and fear
K09 0240 12    and that my hands were soaking wet where they held
K09 0250 10    my gun. I wanted to wipe my flint, but I didn't dare
K09 0260  7    to, the state my hands were in, just as I didn't dare
K09 0270  5    to do anything about the priming. The gun would fire
K09 0280  2    or not, just as chance willed. I put a lot more trust
K09 0280 14    in my two legs than in the gun, because the most important
K09 0290 10    thing I had learned about war was that you could run
K09 0300  8    away and survive to talk about it.
K09 0310  1       The gunfire, which was so near that it seemed just
K09 0310 11    a piece up the road now, stopped for long enough to
K09 0320  8    count to twenty; and in that brief interval, a redcoat
K09 0330  4    officer came tearing down the road, whipping his horse
K09 0340  3    fit to kill. I don't know whether he was after our
K09 0340 14    rider, who had gone by a minute before, or whether
K09 0350 10    he was simply scouting conditions; but when he passed
K09 0360  5    us by, a musket roared, and he reared his horse, swung
K09 0370  3    it around, and began to whip it back in the direction
K09 0380  1    from which he had come. He was a fine and showy rider,
K09 0380 13    but his skill was wasted on us. From above me and somewhere
K09 0390 10    behind me, a rifle cracked. The redcoat officer collapsed
K09 0400  5    like a punctured bolster, and the horse reared and
K09 0410  4    threw him from the saddle, except that one booted foot
K09 0420  1    caught in the stirrup. Half crazed by the weight dragging,
K09 0420 11    the dust, and the heat, the horse leaped our wall,
K09 0430  9    dashing out the rider's brains against it, and leaving
K09 0440  5    him lying there among us- while the horse crashed away
K09 0450  3    through the brush.
K09 0450  6       It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony
K09 0460  5    war plays; for what had happened on the common was
K09 0470  2    only terror and flight; but this grinning, broken head,
K09 0470 11    not ten feet away from me, was the sharp definition
K09 0480 10    of what my reality had become.
K09 0490  2       And now the redcoats were coming, and the gunfire
K09 0490 11    was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west
K09 0500 13    of us. I must state that the faster things happened,
K09 0510  6    the slower they happened; the passage and rhythm of
K09 0520  4    time changed, and when I remember back to what happened
K09 0530  1    then, each event is a separate and frozen incident.
K09 0530 10    In my recollection, there was a long interval between
K09 0540  7    the death of the officer and the appearance of the
K09 0550  5    first of the retreating redcoats, and in that interval
K09 0560  1    the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely.
K09 0560 11    Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds,
K09 0570 12    and then the front of the British army came into view.
K09 0580  8       It was only hours since I had last seen them, but
K09 0590  7    they had changed and I had changed. In the very front
K09 0600  4    rank, two men were wounded and staggered along, trailing
K09 0610  1    blood behind them. No drummers here, no pipers, and
K09 0610 10    the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust.
K09 0620  9    They marched with bayonets fixed, and as fixed on their
K09 0630  6    faces was anger, fear, and torment. Rank after rank
K09 0640  2    of them came down the road, and the faces were all
K09 0640 13    the same, and they walked in a sea of dust.
K09 0650  9       "Committeemen, hold your fire! Hold your fire"!
K09 0660  4    a voice called, and what made it even more terrible
K09 0670  1    and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused
K09 0670 10    for an instant, only some of them glancing toward the
K09 0680  8    stone wall, from behind which the voice came.
K09 0690  4       The front of their column had already passed us,
K09 0700  2    when another officer came riding down the side of the
K09 0700 12    road, not five paces from where we were. My Cousin
K09 0710  9    Simmons carried a musket, but he had loaded it with
K09 0720  7    bird shot, and as the officer came opposite him, he
K09 0730  3    rose up behind the wall and fired. One moment there
K09 0730 13    was a man in the saddle; the next a headless horror
K09 0740  9    on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks, and
K09 0750  5    during the next second or two, we all of us fired into
K09 0760  4    the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers. One moment,
K09 0770  1    the road was filled with disciplined troops, marching
K09 0770  9    four by four with a purpose as implacable as death;
K09 0780  8    the next, a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming
K09 0790  4    fury of sound, out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged
K09 0800  2    with their bayonets and their cursing fury.
K09 0800  9       In the course of this, they had fired on us; but
K09 0810  9    I have no memory of that. I had squeezed the trigger
K09 0820  5    of my own gun, and to my amazement, it had fired and
K09 0830  3    kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry
K09 0830 14    mule; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo
K09 0840 12    of sound, hurling more vile language than I ever thought
K09 0850  8    I knew, sobbing and shouting, and aware that if I had
K09 0860  7    passed water before, it was not enough, for my pants
K09 0870  4    were soaking wet.
K09 0870  7       I would have stood there and died there if left
K09 0880  4    to myself, but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his
K09 0890  1    viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and
K09 0890 11    then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such
K09 0900  9    extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons
K09 0910  4    by far. Everyone else was running. Later we realized
K09 0920  3    that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall.
K09 0930  1    Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road
K09 0930 12    and keep marching.
K09 0940  1    ##
K09 0940  2    We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole, a
K09 0940 13    low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water
K09 0950 10    in its middle. A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded
K09 0960  6    us as if we were insane, as perhaps we were at that
K09 0970  5    moment, with the crazy excitement of our first encounter,
K09 0980  1    the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the
K09 0980 10    road, and the thirst of some of the men, which was
K09 0990  9    so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped
K09 1000  5    up handfuls of it. Isaac Pitt, one of the men from
K09 1010  3    Lincoln, had taken a musket ball in his belly; and
K09 1010 13    though he had found the strength to run with us, now
K09 1020 11    he collapsed and lay on the ground, dying, the Reverend
K09 1030  6    holding his head and wiping his hot brow. It may appear
K09 1040  4    that we were cruel and callous, but no one had time
K09 1050  1    to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac- except the Reverend.
K09 1050 10    I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame
K09 1060 11    for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball,
K09 1070  7    as Isaac had been, yet I also felt relieved and lucky
K09 1080  4    that it had been him and not myself. I was drunk with
K09 1090  2    excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating
K09 1090 11    down from the road, and the fact that I was not afraid
K09 1100 11    now, but only waiting to know what to do next.
K09 1110  7       Meanwhile, I reloaded my gun, as the other men were
K09 1120  4    doing. We were less than a quarter of a mile from the
K09 1130  1    road, and we could trace its shape from the ribbon
K09 1130 11    of powder smoke and dust that hung over it. Wherever
K09 1140  7    you looked, you saw Committeemen running across the
K09 1150  4    meadows, some away from the road, some toward it, some
K09 1160  1    parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster
K09 1160 13    of at least fifty militia were making their way in
K09 1170  8    our direction.
K09 1170 10       Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should
K09 1180  9    march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead
K09 1190  7    of the slow-moving British column, but another group
K09 1200  3    maintained that we should stick to this spot and this
K09 1210  1    section of road. I didn't offer any advice, but I certainly
K09 1210 12    did not want to go back to where the officer lay with
K09 1220 11    his brains dashed out. Someone said that while we were
K09 1240  7    standing here and arguing about it, the British would
K09 1250  4    be gone; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them
K09 1260  2    marching west early in the morning, and moving at a
K09 1260 12    much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for
K09 1270 10    their column to pass, what with the narrowness of the
K09 1280  5    road and their baggage and ammunition carts.
K09 1290  1       While this was being discussed, we saw the militia
K09 1290 10    to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little
K09 1300  9    clusters of two and three men as they approached the
K09 1310  6    road. It was the opinion of some of us that these must
K09 1320  3    be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle
K09 1330  1    of the North Bridge, which entitled them to a sort
K09 1330 11    of veteran status, and we felt that if they employed
K09 1340  8    this tactic, it was likely enough the best one. Mattathias
K09 1350  5    Dover said:
K09 1350  7       "It makes sense. If we cluster together, the redcoats
K09 1370  6    can make an advantage out of it, but there's not a
K09 1380  5    blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except
K09 1390  3    chase us, and we can outrun them".
K09 1390 10       That settled it, and we broke into parties of two
K09 1400  8    and three. Cousin Joshua Dover decided to remain with
K09 1410  4    the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed
K09 1410 13    away- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for
K09 1420 14    long in this world. I went off with Cousin Simmons,
K09 1430  7    who maintained that if he didn't see to me, he didn't
K09 1440  6    know who would.
K09 1440  9       "Good heavens, Adam", he said, "I thought one thing
K09 1450  7    you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of
K09 1460  7    a place".
K09 1460  9       "I learned that now", I said.
K09 1470  3    ##
K09 1470  4    We ran east for about half a mile before we turned
K09 1470 15    back to the road, panting from the effort and soaked
K09 1480 10    with sweat. There was a clump of trees that appeared
K09 1490  8    to provide cover right up to the road, and the shouting
K09 1500  4    and gunfire never slackened.
K09 1500  8       Under the trees, there was a dead redcoat, a young
K09 1510  8    boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples,
K09 1520  6    who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes.
K09 1530  2    Three men were around him. They had stripped him of
K09 1530 12    his musket and equipment, and now they were pulling
K09 1540  8    his boots and jacket off. Cousin Simmons grabbed one
K09 1550  5    of them by the shoulder and flung him away.
K09 1560  1       "God's name, what are you to rob the dead with the
K09 1560 12    fight going on"! Cousin Simmons roared.
K09 1570  6       They tried to outface him, but Joseph Simmons was
K09 1580  6    as wide as two average men, and it would have taken
K09 1590  3    braver men than these were to outface him.
