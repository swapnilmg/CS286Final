J80 0010  1       A gyro-stabilized platform system, using restrained
J80 0010  8    gyros, is well suited for automatic leveling because
J80 0020  7    of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination.
J80 0030  5    The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable
J80 0040  3    response characteristics operates with an approximate
J80 0050  1    equation of motion, neglecting transient effects, as
J80 0050  8    follows: **f where U is a torque applied about the
J80 0060 10    output axis of the controlling gyro.
J80 0070  3       The platform angle |f is the angle about which
J80 0080  2    the gyro is controlling. This is normally termed the
J80 0080 11    gyro input axis, 90` away from the gyro output or |j
J80 0090 10    axis. The gyro angular momentum is defined by H.
J80 0100  6       Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination
J80 0110  2    maintains the platform with zero angular deviation
J80 0120  2    about the |f axis, the system can be rotated with
J80 0120 12    an angular velocity **f if a torque is supplied to
J80 0130 10    the gyro output axis |j. It is assumed that the gyros
J80 0140  7    are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque
J80 0150  5    can be applied about their output axes.
J80 0160  1       In the system shown in Fig. 7-1, the accelerometer
J80 0160 11    output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied
J80 0170  7    to the gyro output-axis torquer. This torque causes
J80 0180  4    the entire system to rotate about the |f axis, since
J80 0190  3    the response to **f. If the polarities are correct,
J80 0190 12    the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce
J80 0200 10    the accelerometer output to zero. As the accelerometer
J80 0210  6    output is decreasing, the torque applied to the gyro
J80 0220  4    output axis decreases and, therefore, the rate decreases.
J80 0230  1    Finally, when the accelerometer output is zero, the
J80 0230  9    entire system remains stationary, and the platform
J80 0240  6    is, by definition, leveled.
J80 0250  1       A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system
J80 0250  9    is shown in Fig. 7-2. The platform is initially off
J80 0260  9    level by the angle |f. The angle generated by the
J80 0270  6    platform servo |f multiplied by g is the effective
J80 0280  4    acceleration acting on the accelerometer. **f is the
J80 0290  3    scale factor of the accelerometer (**f). The voltage
J80 0290 11    **f is amplified by **f and applied to the gyro torquer
J80 0300  9    with scale factor **f. Finally, the gyro-stabilized
J80 0310  5    platform characteristic is represented by **f The system
J80 0320  5    as indicated in Fig. 7-2 is fundamental and simple
J80 0330  1    because the transient effects of both the platform
J80 0330  9    servo and the accelerometer have been neglected. With
J80 0340  6    these factors included, an upper limit is placed on
J80 0350  5    the allowable loop gain by stability considerations.
J80 0360  1    In this type of system, a high loop gain is desirable
J80 0360 12    because it provides a fast response time.
J80 0370  6       When the frequency response characteristics of practical
J80 0380  3    components are considered, their effect on stability
J80 0390  2    does not present the most serious limit on the system
J80 0390 12    loop gain. The time required for the system to reach
J80 0400 10    a level position is approximately inversely proportional
J80 0410  3    to the servo loop gain. In addition, the cutoff frequency
J80 0420  4    for input accelerations is approximately proportional
J80 0430  1    to the servo loop gain; i.e., high loop gain causes
J80 0430 11    the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations.
J80 0440  9    This problem usually determines the lower limit of
J80 0450  7    loop gain rather than response time.
J80 0460  2       It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer
J80 0470  1    responds to any input acceleration. The equation relating
J80 0470  9    input acceleration to output platform angle is **f
J80 0480  8    In practice, the preflight leveling process takes place
J80 0490  5    with the system mounted in the airframe. When the system
J80 0500  4    is arranged for automatic leveling, the platform angles
J80 0510  2    respond to any horizontal components of acceleration
J80 0510  9    acting on the accelerometers. There are many such components
J80 0520  8    of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts,
J80 0530  8    engine noise, turbulence around the vehicle, etc.
J80 0540  4    One of the greatest problems associated with automatic
J80 0550  1    leveling is establishing a true level in the presence
J80 0550 10    of high-level acceleration noise. One solution to the
J80 0560  7    problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include
J80 0570  9    low-pass filters. This technique causes the system
J80 0580  4    to respond only to low frequency acceleration components
J80 0590  1    such as the platform tilt. Since a lower loop gain
J80 0590 11    and low-pass filtering increases the response time,
J80 0600  5    a practical compromise must be reached.
J80 0610  1       One of the most desirable solutions is achieved
J80 0610  9    by the use of a non-linear amplifier for **f. The amplifier
J80 0620 11    is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer
J80 0630  8    signals above a certain threshold level. Below this
J80 0640  4    level, the amplifier gain **f is proportional and is
J80 0650  3    of small value, in order to provide adequate noise
J80 0650 12    filtering. The effect is that the platform returns
J80 0660  7    from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it
J80 0670  6    is nearly level, at which point the platform is controlled
J80 0680  2    by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response
J80 0690  1    so that the noise has little effect on the leveling
J80 0690 11    process.
J80 0690 12       When the system is on automatic leveling, the gyro
J80 0700  9    drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system
J80 0710  7    (amplifier **f). The platform actually tilts off level
J80 0720  4    so that the accelerometer output, when amplified by
J80 0730  2    **f, will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer
J80 0730 12    to cancel the gyro drift. The amount of platform dip
J80 0740  9    required depends upon the scale factors of the system.
J80 0750  6    #7-3. PRACTICAL LEVELING CONSIDERATIONS.#
J80 0760  1    The automatic leveling system described in this section
J80 0760  9    is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform
J80 0770  7    consisting of three integrating gyros. The system requires
J80 0780  5    some switching of flight equipment circuits. However,
J80 0790  2    the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled
J80 0800  1    remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with
J80 0800  9    the platform.
J80 0810  1       This leveling system will hold the platform on-level,
J80 0810 10    automatically, as long as the system is actuated. A
J80 0820  9    useful by-product of this system is that the information
J80 0830  6    necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available
J80 0840  3    from the currents necessary to hold the system in level.
J80 0850  1       The leveling process can be accomplished manually,
J80 0850  8    and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained
J80 0860  7    with automatic equipment. The process consists in turning
J80 0870  5    the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers
J80 0880  4    are zero. The turning is accomplished by applying voltage
J80 0890  2    to the gyro torquers described above. In brief, the
J80 0890 11    human replaces amplifier **f in Figs. 7-1 and 7-2.
J80 0900 11       Manual leveling requires an appropriate display
J80 0910  5    of the accelerometer outputs. If high accuracy is required
J80 0920  5    in preflight leveling, it is usually necessary to integrate
J80 0930  3    or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs (this
J80 0930 10    also minimizes the noise problem). With integration,
J80 0940  7    the effect of a small acceleration (or small platform
J80 0950  5    tilt angle) can be seen after a time. However, skill
J80 0960  3    is required on the part of an operator to level a platform
J80 0970  2    to any degree of accuracy. Also, it requires more time
J80 0970 12    as compared to the automatic approach.
J80 0980  6       Manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform
J80 0990  4    must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged
J80 1000  1    period of time. The operator must continually supply
J80 1000  9    the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers
J80 1010  9    so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled. This
J80 1020  6    process is especially difficult since gyro drifting
J80 1030  2    is typically random.
J80 1030  5    #7-4. PLATFORM HEADING.#
J80 1030  9    Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive
J80 1040  7    axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired
J80 1050  5    coordinate system of the navigator. In simpler terms,
J80 1060  2    it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction.
J80 1070  1       For purely inertial navigators, two techniques are
J80 1070  8    available to accomplish the platform heading:
J80 1080  6    _1._
J80 1080  7       Use of external or surveying equipment to establish
J80 1090  5    proper heading.
J80 1090  7    _2._
J80 1090  8       Use of the characteristics of the platform components
J80 1100  6    for an indication of true heading The choice of the
J80 1110  6    heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements,
J80 1120  2    field conditions, and the time available to accomplish
J80 1130  1    the heading.
J80 1130  3    #7-5. EXTERNAL DETERMINATION OF HEADING- SURVEYING
J80 1140  1    TECHNIQUE.#
J80 1140  2    With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled, it can be
J80 1150  1    headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques.
J80 1150 10    The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified
J80 1160  6    for this procedure. Before the accelerometers are mounted
J80 1170  5    on the platform, the direction of their sensitive axis
J80 1180  4    must be accurately determined. A mirror is mounted
J80 1190  1    on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror
J80 1190 11    is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit.
J80 1200  8    _TRANSIT._
J80 1200  9       A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned
J80 1210  9    with respect to true north. This can be done to a high
J80 1220  7    degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques.
J80 1230  1    With the transit set up, a mirror on one of the accelerometers
J80 1240  1    is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned.
J80 1240 12       The sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture
J80 1250  9    for the transit to project a beam of light, which is
J80 1260  8    darkened by crossed hairs, on the accelerometer mirror.
J80 1270  2    When the platform is aligned, the reflected image of
J80 1280  2    the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed
J80 1280 10    upon the original crossed hairs. The images can easily
J80 1290  7    be aligned with a high degree of accuracy. The platform
J80 1300  5    is turned as required by supplying currents to the
J80 1310  3    appropriate gyro torquers.
J80 1310  6       Although this technique is simple and satisfactory,
J80 1320  4    one practical difficulty does exist: the direction
J80 1330  1    of true north must be known for each launch point.
J80 1330 11    However, this difficulty is not too serious if it is
J80 1340 10    realized that a surveying team can establish a true
J80 1350  6    north base line with a few days' work.
J80 1360  1       In many installations, the inertial platform is
J80 1360  8    raised off the ground a considerable height when it
J80 1370  6    is mounted in the vehicle before flight. With this
J80 1380  3    situation, it is difficult to sight in on the platform
J80 1380 13    with surveying equipment. If the platform is not too
J80 1400  7    high off the ground, a transit can be mounted on a
J80 1410  8    stand to raise it up to the platform. Obviously, the
J80 1420  3    heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since
J80 1430  1    errors are introduced because of motion of the stand.
J80 1440  1    _AUTOCOLLIMATOR._
J80 1440  1       The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator.
J80 1440  9    This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional
J80 1450  6    to the angular deviations of the platform and can be
J80 1460  7    used to automatically hold the platform on true heading.
J80 1470  4    The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified
J80 1480  1    and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer. If the polarity
J80 1480 11    is correct, the platform will turn until the heading
J80 1490  9    error angle is zero. Information is also available
J80 1500  5    from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias
J80 1510  4    for the Z-axis gyro. If the Z gyro is drifting, a
J80 1520  4    current generated by the autocollimator is delivered
J80 1520 11    to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift. If the drift
J80 1530 11    error is systematic, it can be canceled with a bias
J80 1540  8    circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply
J80 1550  3    the required compensating current.
J80 1560  1    _ELECTRICAL PICKOFFS._
J80 1560  1       It is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff,
J80 1560 10    which will indicate the angular deviation between the
J80 1570  8    true heading direction and the platform. Essentially,
J80 1580  5    the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established
J80 1590  5    with respect to the true heading direction, and the
J80 1600  3    platform is turned either manually or automatically
J80 1600 10    until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced
J80 1610  7    to zero.
J80 1610  9    #7-6. GYROCOMPASS HEADING.#
J80 1620  2    Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system
J80 1630  1    which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to
J80 1630 10    establish true heading. For the case of a purely inertial
J80 1640  9    autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros,
J80 1650  4    a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis
J80 1660  2    of the X accelerometer is parallel to the east-west
J80 1660 12    direction at the base point, and the Y accelerometer
J80 1670  9    sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction
J80 1680  9    at the base point. The accelerometers are mounted rigidly
J80 1690  5    on the platform. Thus, if one accelerometer is properly
J80 1700  3    aligned, the other is also. The input axis of the appropriate
J80 1710  2    gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the
J80 1710 11    accelerometers.
J80 1720  1       Figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro
J80 1730  1    vectors arranged as described above. The platform is
J80 1730  9    leveled and properly headed, so that the X-gyro input
J80 1740  8    axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the
J80 1750  6    Y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction.
J80 1760  5       The input axis of the X gyro, when pointing in
J80 1770  4    the east-west direction, is always perpendicular to
J80 1780  1    the spin axis of earth. If the platform is not properly
J80 1780 12    headed, the X-gyro input axis will see a component
J80 1790  9    of the earth's rotation. The sensing of this rotation
J80 1800  6    by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform
J80 1810  5    into proper heading.
J80 1810  8       In Fig. 7-4, the input axis of the three-axis platform
J80 1820  9    is shown at some point on the earth. The point is at
J80 1830  6    a latitude |l, and the platform is at an error in
J80 1840  4    heading east. The earth is spinning at an angular velocity
J80 1850  1    \q equal to one revolution per 24 hr. When the platform
J80 1850 12    is level, |e is a rotation about the Z axis of the
J80 1860 12    platform **f. Since the earth is rotating and the unleveled
J80 1870 10    gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a
J80 1880  7    reference in space, an observer on the earth will see
J80 1890  5    the platform rotating (with respect to the earth).
