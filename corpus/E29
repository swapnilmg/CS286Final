E29 0010  1    The controversy of the last few years over whether
E29 0010 10    architects or interior designers should plan the interiors
E29 0020  6    of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus
E29 0030  4    one important difference of opinion. The architects
E29 0040  1    do not believe that the education of the interior designer
E29 0040 11    is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare
E29 0050  7    with that of the architect and that, therefore, the
E29 0060  5    interior designer is incapable of understanding the
E29 0070  2    architectural principles involved in planning the interior
E29 0080  1    of a building.
E29 0080  4       Ordinary politeness may have militated against this
E29 0090  2    opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide
E29 0090 12    acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through
E29 0100  9    the many round tables, workshops or panel discussions-
E29 0110  4    whatever they are called- on this subject will recognize
E29 0120  3    that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is education.
E29 0130  2       It is true that most architectural schools have
E29 0130 10    five year courses, some even have six or more. The
E29 0140 10    element of public danger which enters so largely into
E29 0150  6    architectural certification, however, would demand
E29 0160  3    a prolonged study of structure. This would, naturally,
E29 0170  1    lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic
E29 0170  9    demands of interior designer's training.
E29 0180  3       We may then dismiss the time difference between
E29 0190  2    these courses and the usual four year course of the
E29 0190 12    interior design student as not having serious bearing
E29 0200  8    on the subject. The real question that follows is-
E29 0210  6    how are those four years used and what is their value
E29 0220  4    as training?
E29 0220  6       The American Institute of Interior Designers has
E29 0230  3    published a recommended course for designers and a
E29 0240  2    percentage layout of such a course. An examination
E29 0240 10    of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses
E29 0250  6    in interior design, for the most part schools accredited
E29 0260  4    by membership in the National Association of Schools
E29 0270  2    of Art, and a further "on the spot" inspection of a
E29 0270 13    number of schools, show their courses adhere pretty
E29 0280  8    closely to the recommendations. One or two of the schools
E29 0290  7    have a five year curriculum, but the usual pattern
E29 0300  4    of American education has limited most of them to the
E29 0310  2    four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable
E29 0310 13    institutions.
E29 0320  1       The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on
E29 0330  2    the usual course offered and on the opinion of many
E29 0330 12    educators as to curricular necessities. Obviously,
E29 0340  4    the four year provision limits this to fundamentals
E29 0350  3    and much desirable material must be eliminated.
E29 0360  1       Without comparing the relative merits of the two
E29 0360  9    courses- architecture versus interior design- let us
E29 0370  6    examine the educational needs of the interior designer.
E29 0380  5       To begin with, what is an interior designer? "The
E29 0390  3    Dictionary of Occupational Titles" published by the
E29 0400  3    U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows:
E29 0400 12    "Designs, plans and furnishes interiors of houses,
E29 0410  7    commercial and institutional structures, hotels, clubs,
E29 0420  4    ships, theaters, as well as set decorations for motion
E29 0430  4    picture arts and television. Makes drawings and plans
E29 0440  2    of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings,
E29 0440 10    wall decorations, and determines color schemes.
E29 0450  6       Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval.
E29 0460  6    Makes necessary purchases, places contracts, supervises
E29 0470  3    construction, installation, finishing and placement
E29 0480  1    of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings,
E29 0480  8    and follows through to completion of project".
E29 0490  6       In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau,
E29 0500  7    when examining applicants for government positions
E29 0510  3    as interior designers, expects that "when various needed
E29 0520  2    objects are not obtainable on the market he will design
E29 0520 12    them. He must be capable of designing for and supervising
E29 0530 10    the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the
E29 0540  8    furnishings".
E29 0540  9       This seems like a large order. The interior designer,
E29 0550  9    then, must first be an artist but also understand carpentry
E29 0560  7    and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance.
E29 0570  4    Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this
E29 0580  1    and any reputable interior designer does know all this
E29 0580 10    and does practice it. And further he must understand
E29 0590  7    his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical
E29 0600  7    necessities but also to enhance and improve his life
E29 0610  3    and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.
E29 0620  1       Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or
E29 0620 11    with the wording of their curriculum. It is in the
E29 0630  8    quality of the teaching of all this that a question
E29 0640  4    may arise.
E29 0640  6       The old established independent art schools try
E29 0650  3    their best to fulfill their obligations. Yet even here
E29 0660  1    many a problem is presented; as in a recent design
E29 0660 11    competition with a floor plan and the simple command-
E29 0670  8    "design a luxury apartment"; no description of the
E29 0680  5    client or his cultural level, no assertion of geographical
E29 0690  2    area or local social necessities- simply "a luxury
E29 0700  1    apartment". Working in a vacuum of minimal information
E29 0700  9    can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions
E29 0710  9    and catalogs and may please the public relations department
E29 0720  6    but have little to do with the essence of interior
E29 0730  4    design.
E29 0730  5       It is possible, of course, to work on extant or
E29 0740  4    projected buildings where either architect or owner
E29 0740 11    will explain their necessities so that the student
E29 0750  8    may get "the feel" of real interior design demands.
E29 0760  6    Unfortunately, the purely synthetic problem is the
E29 0770  4    rule.
E29 0770  5       It is like medical schools in India where, in that
E29 0780  3    fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection
E29 0780 10    of dead bodies is frowned upon. Instead they learn
E29 0790  8    their dissection on the bulbs of plants. Thus technical
E29 0800  5    efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience.
E29 0810  4       In the earlier years of training certain phases
E29 0820  2    of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem
E29 0820 12    has its use. But to continue to divorce advanced students
E29 0830  9    from reality is inexcusable.
E29 0840  1       Consultation with architects, clients, real estate
E29 0840  7    men, fabric houses and furniture companies is essential
E29 0850  8    to the proper development of class problems just as
E29 0860  6    in actual work. Fortunately, although only a few years
E29 0870  5    ago they held the student at arms length, today the
E29 0880  2    business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the
E29 0880 10    student, not only from an increased sense of community
E29 0890  7    responsibility but also from the realization that the
E29 0900  5    student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow-
E29 0910  1    that the student already is "in the trade".
E29 0910  9       Even the "history of furniture" can hardly be taught
E29 0920  9    exclusively from photographs and lantern slides. Here,
E29 0930  6    too, the reality of actual furniture must be experienced.
E29 0940  4       The professional organizations such as American
E29 0950  3    Institute of Interior Designers, National Society of
E29 0960  2    Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various
E29 0960  9    trade associations, can and do aid greatly in this
E29 0970  8    work. Certainly every educator involved in interior
E29 0980  4    design should be a member and active in thework of
E29 0990  2    one of these organizations.
E29 0990  6       Not only should every educator above the rank of
E29 1000  5    instructor be expected to be a member of one of the
E29 1010  2    professional organizations, but his first qualification
E29 1010  8    for membership as an educator should be so sharply
E29 1015  8    scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to
E29 1020  5    certification to teach the subject.
E29 1030  1       Participation for the educator in this case, however,
E29 1030  9    would have to be raised to full and complete membership.
E29 1040  8    The largest of these organizations at present denies
E29 1050  4    to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and
E29 1060  3    standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even
E29 1060 12    the right to attach the customary initials after his
E29 1070  9    name in the college catalog.
E29 1080  1       This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail
E29 1080  9    to lower his standing in the eyes of the students.
E29 1090  9    The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence
E29 1100  6    in his classes of an organization in the policies and
E29 1110  4    standards of which he has no voice.
E29 1110 11       This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute
E29 1120  7    educational qualifications for membership which the
E29 1130  5    organizations profess are ever enforced, the educator
E29 1140  2    will have the molding of the entire profession in his
E29 1140 12    hands.
E29 1150  1       In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice
E29 1150 11    to the schools. That is in the continuance of the "grandfather
E29 1160 11    clauses" in their membership requirements.
E29 1170  5       When these groups were first formed many prominent
E29 1180  5    and accomplished decorators could not have had the
E29 1190  3    advantage of school training since interior design
E29 1190 10    courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth.
E29 1210  5    Long hard years of "on the job" training had brought
E29 1220  5    them to their competence.
E29 1220  9       The necessity of that day has long disappeared.
E29 1230  7    There is plenty of opportunity for proper education
E29 1240  4    today. It is discouraging for students to realize that
E29 1250  2    the societies do not truly uphold the standards for
E29 1250 11    which they are supposed to stand.
E29 1260  5       The reason and the day of "grandfather clauses"
E29 1270  2    has long since passed. No one can deny that these "back
E29 1280  1    door" admissions to membership provisions have been
E29 1280  8    seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in
E29 1290  8    the admission of downright incompetents to membership
E29 1300  3    in supposedly learned societies.
E29 1300  7       Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to
E29 1310  8    subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves.
E29 1320  5    It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have
E29 1330  3    adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge
E29 1330 11    far beyond the immediate necessities of his course
E29 1340  8    plus complete dedication to his subject and to his
E29 1350  7    students. The local decorator who rushes in for a few
E29 1360  5    hours of teaching may but more likely may not have
E29 1360 15    these qualifications.
E29 1370  2       Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still
E29 1380  1    found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.
E29 1380 10       Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated
E29 1390  9    a request for a teacher of interior design. At the
E29 1400  6    end of its letter was the information that applicants
E29 1410  3    for this position "must also be prepared to teach costume
E29 1420  1    design and advertising art". This kind of irresponsibility
E29 1420  9    toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional
E29 1430  9    attitude in the future designer.
E29 1440  5       We must build a corp of highly professional teachers
E29 1450  2    of interior design who have had education, experience
E29 1460  1    in the profession and are willing to take on the usual
E29 1460 12    accompaniments of teaching- minimal income and minimal
E29 1470  7    status among their confreres.
E29 1480  1       Considerable specialization in teaching subjects
E29 1480  6    such as architecture, furniture design, textiles and
E29 1490  5    color is also desirable.
E29 1500  1       In all "degree" courses in interior design a number
E29 1500 10    of "academic" or "general studies" courses are included.
E29 1510  7    It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses
E29 1520  7    in English, history, psychology and so on be as well
E29 1530  7    informed in matters of art, especially interior design,
E29 1540  2    as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.
E29 1540 12    The proper correlation of the art with the academic
E29 1550  9    can be achieved only if this standard is observed.
E29 1560  6    The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for
E29 1570  3    art objectives also must be taken into account.
E29 1580  1       One technical question of school organization comes
E29 1580  7    to mind here. For proper accreditation of schools,
E29 1590  5    teachers in any course must have a degree at least
E29 1600  5    one level above that for which the student is a candidate.
E29 1610  1    Since there are almost no schools in the country offering
E29 1610 11    graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at
E29 1620  9    present be observed. Indeed, it has only been a matter
E29 1630  8    of the last few years that reputable schools of art
E29 1640  4    have granted degrees at all. The question, however,
E29 1650  1    cannot be ignored for long. The basic problem involved
E29 1650 10    is that a college setting up a graduate school must
E29 1660  7    have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced
E29 1670  4    degree. Most professors in the course must, naturally,
E29 1680  1    again have a higher degree than the course offers.
E29 1680 10    One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education
E29 1690  8    but it is a poor substitute. It is a sort of academic
E29 1700  7    ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.
E29 1710  1       This brings us to the question of accreditation
E29 1710  8    of art schools in general. Only the independent art
E29 1720  5    schools, that is, those not connected with any university
E29 1730  4    or college, receive severe and separate investigation
E29 1740  1    before accreditation by the various regional organizations.
E29 1740  8    It has been the custom for most universities to stretch
E29 1750  9    the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts
E29 1760  5    school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts
E29 1770  4    department. This, plus the habit of many schools of
E29 1780  1    simply adding interior design to the many subjects
E29 1780  9    of their home economics department, yet, nevertheless,
E29 1790  4    claiming that they teach interior design, has contributed
E29 1800  4    to the low repute of many university courses in interior
E29 1810  3    design. In spite of this, many universities offer adequate
E29 1820  1    and even distinguished courses in the subject.
E29 1820  8       There will be no mitigation of these offences until
E29 1830  7    all art schools, whether independent or attached to
E29 1840  4    universities have separate accreditation- as do medical
E29 1850  2    schools- by an art accreditation group such as the
E29 1850 11    "National Association of Schools of Art".
E29 1860  6       Independent art schools granting degrees must, naturally,
E29 1870  5    follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate
E29 1880  4    regional group.
