H17 0010  1    It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude "unnourished
H17 0010 12    by sense" to believe that husbands and wives should
H17 0020  8    not be subjected to such a risk, or that such a possibility
H17 0030  8    should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality
H17 0040  3    of the marriage relationship. While it is easy enough
H17 0050  2    to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas of the
H17 0050 10    Crown from a metaphysical point of view, the concept
H17 0060  9    of the "oneness" of a married couple may reflect an
H17 0070  8    abiding belief that the communion between husband and
H17 0080  3    wife is such that their actions are not always to be
H17 0090  1    regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage.
H17 0100  1       By making inroads in the name of law enforcement
H17 0110  9    into the protection which Congress has afforded to
H17 0120  5    the marriage relationship, the Court today continues
H17 0130  2    in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt
H17 0140  1    v. United States, 362 U.S. 525, where the Court held
H17 0140 11    that, under the circumstances of that case, a wife
H17 0150  9    could be compelled to testify against her husband over
H17 0160  6    her objection. One need not waver in his belief in
H17 0170  4    virile law enforcement to insist that there are other
H17 0180  1    things in American life which are also of great importance,
H17 0180 11    and to which even law enforcement must accommodate
H17 0190  6    itself. One of these is the solidarity and the confidential
H17 0200  5    relationship of marriage. The Court's opinion dogmatically
H17 0210  3    asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does
H17 0220  2    not in fact protect this relationship, and that hence
H17 0220 11    the doctrine "enthrone[s] an unreality into a rule
H17 0230  7    of law". I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted
H17 0240  7    by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly
H17 0250  5    dismissed. But in any event, I submit that the power
H17 0260  3    to depose belongs to Congress, not to this Court. I
H17 0260 13    dissent. Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious
H17 0280  8    objector, was convicted of violating @ 12 (a) of the
H17 0290  8    Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing
H17 0300  4    to be inducted into the armed forces. He claims that
H17 0310  2    he was denied due process of law in violation of the
H17 0310 13    Fifth Amendment, because (1) at a hearing before a
H17 0320  8    hearing officer of the Department of Justice, he was
H17 0330  5    not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him
H17 0340  3    by the local board, and (2) at the trial, he was denied
H17 0340 15    the right to have the hearing officer's report and
H17 0350  8    the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
H17 0360  6    as to his claim. Held: On the record in this case,
H17 0370  7    the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act
H17 0380  4    were fully complied with; petitioner was not denied
H17 0380 12    due process; and his conviction is sustained. Pp. 60-66.
H17 0390 10    _(A)_
H17 0390 11       Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative
H17 0400  9    proceedings, because the statement in question was
H17 0410  7    in his file, to which he had access, and he had opportunities
H17 0420  5    to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the
H17 0430  3    Department of Justice and before the appeal board.
H17 0430 11    Pp. 62-63.
H17 0440  3    _(B)_
H17 0450  1       Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing
H17 0450  9    officer's notes and report, especially since he failed
H17 0460  8    to show any particular need for them and he did have
H17 0470  8    a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation
H17 0480  2    to the appeal board. Pp. 63-64.
H17 0480  9    _(C)_
H17 0490  1       Petitioner was not entitled, either in the administrative
H17 0490  9    hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial,
H17 0500  9    to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau
H17 0510  5    of Investigation, since he was furnished a resume of
H17 0520  4    it, did not challenge its accuracy, and showed no particular
H17 0530  1    need for the original report. Pp. 64-66.
H17 0530  9       Haydn C. Covington argued the cause and filed a
H17 0540  8    brief for petitioner.
H17 0550  1       Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United
H17 0550 10    States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin,
H17 0560  8    Assistant Attorney General Wilkey, Beatrice Rosenberg
H17 0570  5    and J. F. Bishop.
H17 0580  1       MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.
H17 0590  1       This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted
H17 0590 10    into the armed services, in violation of the provisions
H17 0600  8    of the Universal Military Training and Service Act,
H17 0610  5    62 Stat. 604, 622, 50 U.S.C. App. @ 462 (a). Petitioner,
H17 0620  6    who claims to be a conscientious objector, contends
H17 0630  3    that he was denied due process, both in the proceedings
H17 0640  1    before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice
H17 0640 10    and at trial. He says that he was not permitted to
H17 0650 10    rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed
H17 0660  4    to him by the local board, and, further, that he was
H17 0670  4    denied at trial the right to have the Department of
H17 0670 14    Justice hearing officer's report and the original report
H17 0680  8    of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim-
H17 0690  8    all in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The trial
H17 0700  5    judge decided that the administrative procedures of
H17 0710  2    the Act were fully complied with and refused to require
H17 0720  1    the production of such documents. Petitioner was found
H17 0720  9    guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The
H17 0730  6    Court of Appeals affirmed. 269 F. 2d 613. We granted
H17 0740  7    certiorari in view of the importance of the questions
H17 0750  3    in the administration of the Act. 361 U. S. 899. We
H17 0760  2    have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled
H17 0760  9    by the rationale of gonzales v. United States, 348
H17 0770  7    U.S. 407 (1955), and United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S.
H17 0780  8    1 (1953), and therefore affirm the judgment.
H17 0790  6       Petitioner registered with Local Board No. 9, Boulder,
H17 0800  6    Colorado, on March 17, 1952. His answers to the classification
H17 0810  5    questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's
H17 0820  4    Witnesses, employed at night by a sugar producer. He
H17 0830  2    claimed IV-D classification as a minister of religion,
H17 0840  1    devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching.
H17 0840 11    On November 13, 1952, he was classified in Class I-A.
H17 0850 10    On November 22, 1952, he wrote the Board, protesting
H17 0860  7    this classification. He again stated that he was "a
H17 0870  5    regular minister"; that he was "devoting an average
H17 0880  1    of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly",
H17 0880 10    in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial
H17 0890  8    duties, and that he opposed war in any form. Thereafter
H17 0900  4    he was classified I-O. On April 1, 1953, after some
H17 0910  3    six months of full-time "pioneering", petitioner discontinued
H17 0920  1    devoting 100 hours a month to preaching, but failed
H17 0920 10    to so notify his local board. In a periodic review,
H17 0930  9    the local board on July 30, 1953, reclassified him
H17 0940  5    I-A and upheld this classification after a personal
H17 0950  4    appearance by petitioner, because of his willingness
H17 0960  1    to kill in defense of his church and home. Upon administrative
H17 0960 12    approval of the reclassification, he was ordered to
H17 0970  8    report for induction on June 11, 1956, but failed to
H17 0980  7    do so. He was not prosecuted, however, and his case
H17 0990  4    was subsequently reopened, in the light of Sicurella
H17 1000  1    v. United States, 348 U.S. 385 (1955). He was again
H17 1010  1    reclassified I-A by the local board. There followed
H17 1010 10    a customary Department of Justice hearing, at which
H17 1020  7    petitioner appeared. In his report to the Attorney
H17 1030  6    General, the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner
H17 1040  3    be exempt only from combatant training and service.
H17 1050  1    On March 21, 1957, however, the Department recommended
H17 1050  9    approval of the I-A classification. Its ground for
H17 1060  8    this recommendation was that, while petitioner claimed
H17 1070  5    before the local board August 17, 1956 (as evidenced
H17 1080  3    by its memorandum in his file of that date), that he
H17 1090  1    was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching,
H17 1090 10    the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported
H17 1100  6    that he was no longer doing so and, on the contrary,
H17 1110  5    had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student
H17 1120  2    Servant positions. It reported that he now devoted
H17 1120 10    only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching
H17 1130  9    and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities.
H17 1140  5    His claim was therefore "so highly exaggerated", the
H17 1150  2    Department concluded, that it "cast doubt upon his
H17 1160  1    veracity and, consequently, upon his sincerity and
H17 1160  8    good faith". The appeal board furnished petitioner
H17 1170  5    a copy of the recommendation. In his answer thereto,
H17 1180  4    he advised the Board that he had made no such statement
H17 1190  1    in 1956, and asserted that his only claim to "pioneering"
H17 1200  1    was in 1952. The appeal board, however, unanimously
H17 1200  9    concurred in the Department's recommendation. Upon
H17 1210  4    return of the file to the local board, petitioner was
H17 1220  4    again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution
H17 1230  2    followed his failure to do so.
H17 1230  8       Petitioner first contends that the Department denied
H17 1240  5    him procedural due process by not giving him timely
H17 1250  3    opportunity, before its final recommendation to the
H17 1250 10    appeal board, to answer the statement of the local
H17 1260  9    board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual
H17 1270  7    preaching. But the statement of the local board attributing
H17 1280  4    this claim to petitioner was in his file. He admitted
H17 1290  2    that he knew it was open to him at all times, and he
H17 1290 15    could have rebutted it before the hearing officer.
H17 1300  7    This he failed to do, asserting that he did not know
H17 1310  6    it to be in his file. Apparently he never took the
H17 1320  3    trouble to find out. Nevertheless he had ample opportunity
H17 1330  1    to contest the statement before the appeal board. After
H17 1330 10    the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to
H17 1340  7    the appeal board, that is the appropriate place for
H17 1350  4    a registrant to lodge his denial. This he did. We found
H17 1360  3    in Gonzales v. United States, supra, that this was
H17 1370  2    the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation
H17 1370 10    should be furnished a registrant. We said there that
H17 1380  8    it was necessary "that a registrant be given an opportunity
H17 1390  7    to rebut [the Department's] recommendation when it
H17 1400  4    comes to the Appeal Board, the agency with the ultimate
H17 1410  2    responsibility for classification". 348 U.S., at 412.
H17 1420  1    We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice
H17 1420 12    to petitioner's contention, which was considered by
H17 1430  6    the appeal board and denied by it. As was said in Gonzales,
H17 1440  9    "it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective
H17 1450  5    service determination considered 'final' in the courts,
H17 1460  4    not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact.
H17 1470  1    Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114". 348 U. S., at
H17 1480  3    412-413.
H17 1480  5       But there are other contentions which might be considered
H17 1490  3    more difficult. At his trial, petitioner sought to
H17 1490 11    secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes
H17 1500  8    of the Department's hearing officer, Evensen, as well
H17 1510  6    as his report thereon. Petitioner also claimed at trial
H17 1520  5    the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of
H17 1530  3    Investigation reports to the Department of Justice.
H17 1540  1    He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence
H17 1540  9    withheld; nor did he elaborate just what favorable
H17 1550  7    evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports
H17 1560  3    might disclose.
H17 1560  5       Section 6 (j) of the Act, as we have held, does
H17 1570  6    require the Department's recommendation to be placed
H17 1580  3    in a registrant's file. Gonzales v. United States,
H17 1590  1    supra. But there is nothing in the Act requiring the
H17 1590 11    hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over
H17 1600  8    to the registrant. While the regulations formerly required
H17 1610  5    that the hearing officer's report be placed in the
H17 1620  5    registrant's file, this requirement was eliminated
H17 1630  1    in 1952. Moreover, the hearing officer's report is
H17 1630  9    but intradepartmental, is directed to the Attorney
H17 1640  6    General and, of course, is not the recommendation of
H17 1650  4    the Department. It is not essentially different from
H17 1660  2    a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice,
H17 1660 12    of which the Attorney General receives many, and to
H17 1670  9    which he may give his approval or rejection. It is
H17 1680  7    but part of the whole process within the Department
H17 1690  3    that goes into the making of the final recommendation
H17 1700  1    to the appeal board.
H17 1700  5       It is also significant that neither this report
H17 1710  2    nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the
H17 1710 11    appeal board. Hence the petitioner had full opportunity
H17 1720  8    to traverse the only conclusions of the Department
H17 1730  5    on file with the Board. Petitioner knew that the Department's
H17 1740  5    recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's
H17 1750  2    report but on the statement of the local board in his
H17 1760  1    file. Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding
H17 1760 10    of the local board before both the hearing officer
H17 1770  7    and the appeal board, petitioner cannot now claim that
H17 1780  5    he was denied due process because he did not succeed.
H17 1790  1       It appears to us that the same reasoning applies
H17 1790 10    to the production of the hearing officer's report and
H17 1800  8    notes at the trial. In addition, petitioner has failed
H17 1810  6    to show any particular need for the report and notes.
H17 1820  4    While there are now allegations of the withholding
H17 1830  1    of "favorable evidence developed at the hearing" and
H17 1830  9    a denial of a "full and fair hearing", no such claim
H17 1840  9    was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative
H17 1850  6    process. Moreover, his testimony at trial never developed
H17 1860  4    any such facts. In the light of these circumstances,
H17 1870  1    as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this
H17 1870 13    respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation,
H17 1880  6    which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal
H17 1890  7    board and the courts below found supported by the record,
H17 1900  5    we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report
H17 1910  2    and notes.
H17 1910  4       Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to
H17 1920  2    inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before
H17 1920 10    the hearing officer as well as at the trial. He did
H17 1930 11    receive a resume of it- the same that was furnished
H17 1940  6    the appeal board- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy.
H17 1950  5    Even now no such claim is asserted. He bases his present
H17 1960  3    contention on the general right to explore, indicating
H17 1960 11    that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume.
H17 1970 10    But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent,
H17 1980  7    supra. There we held "that the statutory scheme for
H17 1990  6    review, within the selective service system, ... entitles
H17 2000  4    [conscientious objectors] to no guarantee that the
H17 2010  2    FBI reports must be produced for their inspection".
H17 2010 10    346 U.S., at 5-6. Even if we were not bound by Nugent,
H17 2020 13    petitioner here would not be entitled to the report.
H17 2030  9    The recommendation of the Department- as well as the
H17 2040  7    decision of the appeal board- was based entirely on
H17 2050  4    the local board file, not on an FBI report.
