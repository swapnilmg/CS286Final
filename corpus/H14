H14 0010  1    From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public
H14 0010 11    Law 236, 66th Congress, the purpose of the vocational
H14 0020  7    rehabilitation program has been to assist the States,
H14 0030  5    by means of grants-in-aid, to return disabled men and
H14 0040  3    women to productive, gainful employment. The authority
H14 0040 10    for the program was renewed several times until the
H14 0050  9    vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent
H14 0060  5    as Title V of the Social Security Act in 1935. Up
H14 0070  5    to this time and for the next eight years, the services
H14 0080  1    provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training,
H14 0080  8    counseling, and placement on a job. Recognizing the
H14 0090  8    limitations of such a program, the 78th Congress in
H14 0100  5    1943 passed P. L. 113, which broadened the concept
H14 0110  3    of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical
H14 0120  1    restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities,
H14 0120  8    and which revised the financing structure.
H14 0130  4    _RECENT CHANGES._
H14 0130  6       Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a
H14 0140  5    half million disabled persons in the first eleven years
H14 0150  3    after 1943, the existing program was still seen to
H14 0150 12    be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of
H14 0160  9    an estimated two million disabled. To assist the States,
H14 0170  6    therefore, in rehabilitating handicapped individuals,
H14 0180  2    "so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative
H14 0190  1    employment to the extent of their capabilities", the
H14 0190  9    83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation
H14 0200  6    Amendments of 1954 (P. L. 565). These amendments to
H14 0210  7    the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to
H14 0220  5    help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities,
H14 0230  2    for more sheltered and "half-way" workshops, for greater
H14 0240  2    numbers of adequately trained personnel, for more comprehensive
H14 0250  1    services to individuals (particularly to the homebound
H14 0250  8    and the blind), and for other administrative improvements
H14 0260  6    to increase the program's overall effectiveness.
H14 0270  3    _FINANCIAL ASPECTS._
H14 0270  5       Under the law as it existed until 1943, the Federal
H14 0280  6    Government made grants to the States on the basis of
H14 0290  5    population, matching State expenditures on a 50-50
H14 0300  1    basis. Under P. L. 113, 78th Congress, the Federal
H14 0300 10    Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary
H14 0310  7    State expenditures in connection with administration
H14 0320  5    and the counseling and placement of the disabled, and
H14 0330  4    for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients
H14 0340  1    with rehabilitation case services. Throughout these
H14 0340  7    years, the statutory authorization was for such sums
H14 0350  6    as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the
H14 0360  5    Act.
H14 0360  6       The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing
H14 0370  3    of the vocational rehabilitation program, providing
H14 0380  1    for a three-part grant structure- for (1) basic support;
H14 0380 11    (2) extension and improvement; and (3) research, demonstrations,
H14 0390  7    training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation-
H14 0400  5    and in addition for short-term training and instruction.
H14 0410  6    The first part of the new structure- that for supporting
H14 0420  6    the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services-
H14 0430  1    is described in this Section. Subsequent sections on
H14 0440  2    grants describe the other categories of the grant structure.
H14 0450  1       The following table shows, for selected years, the
H14 0450  9    authorizations, appropriations, allotment base, Federal
H14 0460  5    grants to States and State matching funds for this
H14 0470  5    part of the grant program:
H14 0470 10    #METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING FUNDS#
H14 0480  3    _DESCRIPTION OF FORMULA._
H14 0480  6       In order to assist the States in maintaining basic
H14 0500  6    vocational rehabilitation services, Section 2 of the
H14 0510  4    amended Act provides that allotments to States for
H14 0520  1    support of such services be based on (1) need, as measured
H14 0520 12    by a State's population, and (2) fiscal capacity, as
H14 0530  7    measured by its per capita income. The Act further
H14 0540  5    provides for a "floor" or minimum allotment, set at
H14 0550  3    the 1954 level, which is called the "base" allotment,
H14 0560  1    and a "ceiling" or maximum allotment, for each State.
H14 0560 10    It stipulates, in addition, that all amounts remaining
H14 0570  7    as a result of imposing the "ceiling", and not used
H14 0590  4    for insuring the "floor", be redistributed to those
H14 0600  3    States still below their maximums. These provisions
H14 0610  1    are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and
H14 0610 10    population among the States, with the objective that
H14 0620  7    a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed
H14 0630  5    services regardless of whether he resides in a State
H14 0640  3    with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely
H14 0640 14    or thickly populated State. The provisions are also
H14 0650  7    designed to avoid disruption in State programs already
H14 0660  5    in operation, which might otherwise result from the
H14 0670  3    allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population
H14 0680  1    alone.
H14 0680  2    _METHOD OF COMPUTING ALLOTMENTS._
H14 0680  6       The method used in computing the allotments is specifically
H14 0690  5    set forth in the Act. The term "State" means the several
H14 0700  5    States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands,
H14 0710  3    Guam and Puerto Rico; the term "United States" includes
H14 0720  2    the several States and the District of Columbia, and
H14 0730  1    excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico,
H14 0730  9    and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following
H14 0740  7    steps are employed in calculations:
H14 0750  1    _1._
H14 0750  2       For each State (except Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin
H14 0760  2    Islands, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii) determine
H14 0770  1    average per capita income based on the last three years.
H14 0770 11    (See Source of Data, below for per capita income data
H14 0780  9    to be used in this step.)
H14 0790  1    _2._
H14 0790  2       Determine the average per capita income for the
H14 0790 10    U. S. based on the last three years. (See Source of
H14 0800 10    Data, below, for per capita income data to be used
H14 0810  9    in this step.)
H14 0810 12    _3._
H14 0810 13       Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita
H14 0820 10    income of the U. S. (Divide 50 by the result obtained
H14 0830  7    in item 2 above.)
H14 0830 11    _4._
H14 0830 12       Determine for each State (except the Virgin Islands,
H14 0840  8    Guam and Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and
H14 0850  8    Hawaii) that percentage which bears the same ratio
H14 0860  5    to 50% as the particular State's average per capita
H14 0870  2    income bears to the average per capita income of the
H14 0870 12    U. S. (Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above
H14 0880  9    by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above.)
H14 0890  8    _5._
H14 0890  9       Determine the particular State's "allotment percentage".
H14 0900  4    By law this is 75% for the Virgin Islands, Guam and
H14 0910  6    Puerto Rico. (Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment
H14 0920  3    percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962.)
H14 0930  1       In all other States it is the difference obtained
H14 0930 10    by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item
H14 0940  8    4 above; except that no State shall have an allotment
H14 0950  6    percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more than 75%. If
H14 0960  4    the resulting difference for the particular State is
H14 0970  1    less or more than these extremes, the State's allotment
H14 0970 10    percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate
H14 0980  9    extreme.
H14 0980 10    _6._
H14 0980 11       Square each State's allotment percentage.
H14 0990  5    _7._
H14 0990  6       Determine each State's population. (See Source of
H14 1000  5    Data, below for population data to be used in this
H14 1010  6    step.)
H14 1010  7    _8._
H14 1010  8       Multiply the population of each State by the square
H14 1020  5    of its allotment percentage. (Multiply result obtained
H14 1030  1    in item 7 above, by result obtained in item 6 above.)
H14 1030 12    _9._
H14 1040  1       Determine the sum of the products obtained in item
H14 1040 10    8 above, for all the States. (For each State, make
H14 1050  6    all computations set forth in items 1 to 8 above, and
H14 1060  6    then add the results obtained for each State in item
H14 1070  1    8.)
H14 1070  2    _10._
H14 1070  3       Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted
H14 1080  1    is to the sum of the products for all the States. (Divide
H14 1080 13    the amount being allotted by the result obtained in
H14 1090  8    item 9 above.)
H14 1090 11    _11._
H14 1090 12       Determine the particular State's unadjusted allotment
H14 1100  6    for the particular fiscal year. (Multiply the State
H14 1110  6    product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item
H14 1120  5    10 above.)
H14 1120  7    _12._
H14 1120  8       Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment
H14 1130  4    (result obtained in item 11 above) is greater than
H14 1140  4    its maximum allotment, and if so lower its unadjusted
H14 1150  1    allotment to its maximum allotment. (Each State's unadjusted
H14 1150  9    allotment for any fiscal year, which exceeds its minimum
H14 1160  9    allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage
H14 1170  8    greater than one and one-half times the percentage
H14 1180  3    by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000,
H14 1190  1    must be reduced by the amount of the excess.)
H14 1190 10    _13._
H14 1190 11       Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment
H14 1200  6    (result obtained in item 11 above) is less than its
H14 1210  7    minimum (base) allotment, and if so raise its unadjusted
H14 1220  1    allotment to its minimum allotment. Regardless of its
H14 1220  9    unadjusted allotment, each State is guaranteed by law
H14 1230  8    a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment
H14 1240  7    which it received in fiscal year 1954- increased by
H14 1250  5    a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total
H14 1260  1    1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000.
H14 1260  9    _14._
H14 1260 10       The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above
H14 1270  8    are used: first, to increase the unadjusted allotments
H14 1280  4    to the specified minimum in those States where the
H14 1290  3    unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment
H14 1290 11    (item 13 above); and second, to increase uniformly
H14 1300  8    the allotments to those States whose allotments are
H14 1310  5    below their maximums, with adjustments to prevent the
H14 1320  4    allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum.
H14 1330  1    _ADDITIONAL NOTE ON ALLOTMENTS._
H14 1330  5       For the States which maintain two separate agencies-
H14 1340  4    one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind,
H14 1350  3    and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than
H14 1350 12    the blind- the Act specifies that their minimum (base)
H14 1360  8    allotment shall be divided between the two agencies
H14 1370  7    in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal
H14 1380  3    year 1954. Funds allotted in addition to their minimum
H14 1390  1    allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they
H14 1390 10    may determine.
H14 1400  1    #MATCHING REQUIREMENTS#
H14 1400  3    _EXPLANATION OF MATCHING FORMULA._
H14 1410  1       As is the case with the allotment provisions for
H14 1410  9    support of vocational rehabilitation services, the
H14 1420  4    matching requirements are also based on a statutory
H14 1430  3    formula. Prior to 1960, in order to provide matching
H14 1430 12    for the minimum (base) allotment, State funds had to
H14 1440  9    equal 1954 State funds. Prior to and since 1960 the
H14 1450  7    rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related
H14 1460  4    to the fiscal capacity of the State, with a pivot of
H14 1470  2    40% State (or 60% Federal) participation in total program
H14 1480  1    costs. The percentage of Federal participation in such
H14 1480  9    costs for any State is referred to in the law as that
H14 1490 10    State's "Federal share". For purposes of this explanation,
H14 1500  6    this percentage is referred to as the States "unadjusted
H14 1510  5    Federal share". Beginning in 1960, the matching requirements
H14 1520  3    for the base allotment are being adjusted (upward or
H14 1530  2    downward, as required) 25% a year, so that by 1963
H14 1530 12    the entire support allotment will be matched on the
H14 1540  8    basis of a 40% pivot State share, with maximum and
H14 1550  5    minimum State shares of 50% and 30%, respectively.
H14 1560  1    The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect
H14 1570  1    to any State's base allotment, as well as the adjusted
H14 1570 11    rate in effect during the 1960-1962 period, is designated
H14 1580  8    by the statute as that State's "adjusted Federal Share".
H14 1590  5    The provisions for determining a State's unadjusted
H14 1600  4    Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial
H14 1610  3    resources among the States. The purpose of the adjusted
H14 1620  1    Federal share relating to the base allotment and of
H14 1620 10    the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted
H14 1630  5    Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt
H14 1640  4    changes in matching rates.
H14 1650  1    _METHOD OF COMPUTING FEDERAL SHARES._
H14 1650  3       The method used for computing the respective Federal
H14 1660  2    and State shares in total program costs is specifically
H14 1660 11    set forth in the Act. The term "State" means the several
H14 1670 11    States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands,
H14 1680  8    Guam and Puerto Rico; the term "United States" includes
H14 1690  6    the several States and the District of Columbia and
H14 1700  6    excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico,
H14 1710  4    and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following
H14 1720  1    steps are employed in the calculations:
H14 1720  7    _1._
H14 1720  8       For each State (except the Virgin Islands, Guam,
H14 1730  6    Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii),
H14 1740  4    determine the average per capita income for the last
H14 1750  3    three years. (the same amount used in item 1 under
H14 1750 13    Method of Computing allotments, above.)
H14 1760  5    _2._
H14 1760  6       Determine the average per capita income for the
H14 1770  6    United States for the last three years. (The same amount
H14 1780  3    used in item 2 under Method of Computing Allotments,
H14 1790  1    above.)
H14 1790  2    _3._
H14 1790  3       Determine the ratio of 40% to the average per capita
H14 1800  2    income of the United States. (Divide 40 by the amount
H14 1800 12    used in item 2 above.)
H14 1810  5    _4._
H14 1810  6       Determine for each State (except the Virgin Islands,
H14 1820  2    Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and hawaii),
H14 1830  1    that percentage which bears the same ration to 40%
H14 1830 10    as the particular State's average per capita income
H14 1840  6    bears to the average per capita income of the United
H14 1850  6    States. (Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above
H14 1860  5    by the amount used for each State in item 1 above.)
H14 1860 16    _5._
H14 1870  1       Determine the particular State's "Federal Share".
H14 1870  7    By law this is 70% for the Virgin Islands, Guam and
H14 1880 11    Puerto Rico. (Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share
H14 1890  8    percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962.)
H14 1900  5       In all other States it is the difference obtained
H14 1910  2    by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item
H14 1910 11    4 above; except that no State shall have a Federal
H14 1920  8    share less than 50% nor more than 70%. If the resulting
H14 1930  9    difference for the particular State is less or more
H14 1940  6    than these extremes, the State's Federal share must
H14 1950  3    be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.
