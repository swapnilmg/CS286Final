C05 0010  1       The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of
C05 0010  8    William James was never more evident than in his letters.
C05 0020  9    Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as
C05 0030  6    well as thinking. To both persons and ideas he brought
C05 0040  3    the same delighted interest, the same open-minded relish
C05 0050  1    for what was unique in each, the same discriminating
C05 0050 10    sensibility and quicksilver intelligence, the same
C05 0060  5    gallantry of judgment.
C05 0060  8       For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series,
C05 0070  9    under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger,
C05 0080  5    Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably
C05 0090  3    displays the variety of James's genius, not to mention
C05 0100  3    the felicities of his style. And how he could write!
C05 0110  1    His famous criticism of brother Henry's "third style"
C05 0110  9    is surely as subtly, even elegantly, worded an analysis
C05 0120  8    of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself
C05 0130  6    could ever have produced. His letter to his daughter
C05 0140  4    on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant,
C05 0150  1    forthright, and warmly understanding a piece of advice
C05 0150  9    as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child, and
C05 0160  7    with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor.
C05 0170  3    #@#
C05 0170  4    Most of all, his letters to his philosophic colleagues
C05 0180  2    show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help
C05 0190  1    to explain Whitehead's reference to James as "that
C05 0190  9    adorable genius". Miss Hardwick speaks of his "superb
C05 0200  7    gift for intellectual friendship", and it is certainly
C05 0210  6    a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from
C05 0220  5    either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.
C05 0230  1       This is a virtue of which we have great need in
C05 0230 12    a society where there seems to be an increasing lack
C05 0240  8    of communication- or even desire for communication-
C05 0250  3    between differing schools of thought. It holds an equally
C05 0260  3    valuable lesson for a society where the word "intellectual"
C05 0270  1    has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning
C05 0270 12    people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive
C05 0280  9    of the simpler human virtues.
C05 0290  2       To his Harvard colleague, Josiah Royce, whose philosophic
C05 0300  1    position differed radically from his own, James could
C05 0300  9    write, "Different as our minds are, yours has nourished
C05 0310  9    mine, as no other social influence ever has, and in
C05 0320  7    converse with you I have always felt that my life was
C05 0330  5    being lived importantly".
C05 0330  8       Of another colleague, George Santayana, he could
C05 0340  5    write: "The great event in my life recently has been
C05 0350  6    the reading of Santayana's book. Although I absolutely
C05 0360  3    reject the Platonism of it, I have literally squealed
C05 0370  1    with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which
C05 0370  9    the position is laid down on page after page".
C05 0380  8    #@#
C05 0380  9    Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer- "Glorious
C05 0390  5    old Palmer", as he addresses him- James says that if
C05 0400  5    only the students at Harvard could really understand
C05 0410  2    Royce, Santayana, Palmer, and himself and see that
C05 0420  1    their varying systems are "so many religions, ways
C05 0420  9    of fronting life, and worth fighting for", then Harvard
C05 0430  7    would have a genuine philosophic universe. "The best
C05 0440  4    condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry
C05 0450  3    of the diverse systems ... The world might ring with
C05 0450 13    the struggle, if we devoted ourselves exclusively to
C05 0460  8    belaboring each other".
C05 0470  1       The "belaboring" is of course jocular, yet James
C05 0470  9    was not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless
C05 0480  7    we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the
C05 0490  6    great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on
C05 0500  4    his vision of God. To James this vision never quite
C05 0510  1    came, despite his appreciation of it in others.
C05 0510  9       But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired
C05 0520  9    prophet in his words to one correspondent: "You ask
C05 0530  3    what I am going to 'reply' to Bradley. But why need
C05 0540  4    one reply to everything and everybody? ... I think
C05 0550  1    that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.
C05 0560  1    All polemic of ours should, I believe, be either very
C05 0560 11    broad statements of contrast, or fine points treated
C05 0570  7    singly, and as far as possible impersonally ... As
C05 0580  4    far as the rising generation goes, why not simply express
C05 0590  2    ourselves positively, and trust that the truer view
C05 0590 10    quietly will displace the other. Here again 'God will
C05 0600  9    know his own'".
C05 0610  1       The collected works of James Thurber, now numbering
C05 0610  9    25 volumes (including the present exhibit) represent
C05 0620  6    a high standard of literary excellence, as every schoolboy
C05 0630  5    knows. The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings,
C05 0640  4    akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall,
C05 0650  1    is equally well known. About all that remains to be
C05 0650 11    said is that the present selection, most of which appeared
C05 0660  7    first in The New Yorker, comprises (as usual) a slightly
C05 0670  6    unstrung necklace, held together by little more than
C05 0680  3    a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of
C05 0680 12    the book.
C05 0690  2       The one unifying note, if any, is sounded in the
C05 0690 12    initial article entitled: "How to Get Through the Day".
C05 0700  9    It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate
C05 0710  8    word-games for insomniacs, the hospitalized, and others
C05 0720  5    forced to rely on inner resources, including (in the
C05 0730  4    P's alone) "palindromes", "paraphrases", and "parodies".
C05 0740  3       "The Tyranny of Trivia" suggests arbitrary alphabetical
C05 0750  3    associations to induce slumber. And new vistas of hairshirt
C05 0760  3    asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled:
C05 0770  1    "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs",
C05 0780  1    "Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream", and "The New
C05 0780 11    Vocabularianism". Some of Thurber's curative methods
C05 0790  6    involve strong potions of mixed metaphor, malapropism,
C05 0800  6    and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in
C05 0810  5    extreme cases.
C05 0810  7    #@#
C05 0810  8    A burlesque paean entitled: "Hark the Herald Tribune,
C05 0820  6    Times, and All the Other Angels Sing" brilliantly succeeds
C05 0830  5    in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey. "How
C05 0840  3    the Kooks Crumble" features an amusingly accurate take-off
C05 0850  4    on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV
C05 0860  1    commercials, and "The Watchers of the Night" is a veritable
C05 0870  1    waking nightmare.
C05 0870  3       A semi-serious literary document entitled "The Wings
C05 0880  3    of Henry James" is noteworthy, if only for a keenly
C05 0890  1    trenchant though little-known comment on the master's
C05 0890  9    difficult later period by modest Owen Wister, author
C05 0900  8    of "The Virginian". James, he remarks in a letter to
C05 0910  8    a friend, "is attempting the impossible ... namely,
C05 0920  3    to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces
C05 0930  1    upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous
C05 0930  9    impressions. He would like to put several sentences
C05 0940  7    on top of each other so that you could read them all
C05 0950  5    at once, and get all at once, the various shadings
C05 0960  1    and complexities".
C05 0960  3       Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following
C05 0970  3    remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation:
C05 0980  1    "So much has already been written about everything
C05 0980  9    that you can't find out anything about it". Or the
C05 0990  8    mildly epigrammatic utterance (also a quotation): "Woman's
C05 1000  5    place is in the wrong". Who but Thurber can be counted
C05 1010  6    on to glean such nectareous essences?
C05 1020  1       A tribute to midsummer "bang-sashes" seems terribly
C05 1020  9    funny, though it would be hard to explain why. "One
C05 1030 10    of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed
C05 1040  7    around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and
C05 1050  5    out of bed. 'It's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly,
C05 1060  1    and I sighed with relief. 'Thank God for that' I said;
C05 1070  1    'I thought it was a human being'".
C05 1070  8    #@#
C05 1070  9    In a sense, perhaps, Thurber is indebted artistically
C05 1080  6    to the surrealist painter (was it Salvador Dali?) who
C05 1090  6    first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window
C05 1100  4    in the abdomen. That is, it is literally a picture
C05 1110  1    window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture-
C05 1110 12    trees, or flowers. This is something like what Thurber's
C05 1120  9    best effects are like, if I am not mistaken.
C05 1130  8       Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic
C05 1140  4    pen-and-ink sketches (several old favorites are scattered
C05 1150  2    through the present volume) Thurber has retained unimpaired
C05 1160  1    his vision of humor as a thing of simple, unaffected
C05 1160 11    humanness. In his concluding paragraph he writes: "The
C05 1170  7    devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come
C05 1180  7    as close to truth as he can". For many readers Thurber
C05 1190  3    comes closer than anyone else in sight.
C05 1200  1       The latest Low is a puzzler. The master's hand has
C05 1200 11    lost none of its craft. He is at his usual best in
C05 1210 11    exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political
C05 1220  3    and diplomatic life in the fifties. The reader meets
C05 1230  2    a few old friends like Blimp and the TUC horse, and
C05 1240  1    becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast
C05 1240 10    of characters like the bomb itself, and civilization
C05 1250  6    in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race,
C05 1260  4    her hair standing straight out.
C05 1260  9       But there is a difference between the present volume
C05 1270  8    and the early Low. There is fear in the fifties as
C05 1280  7    his title suggests and as his competent drawings show.
C05 1290  2    But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis
C05 1290 12    were on the loose and in those days Low struck like
C05 1300 11    lightning.
C05 1300 12    #@#
C05 1300 13    Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference.
C05 1310  9    It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman
C05 1320  8    than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in
C05 1330  6    a lower key. But this argument cannot be pushed very
C05 1340  3    far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings
C05 1350  1    of its leaders in respect to corrosion. The Communists
C05 1350 10    wield a power unknown to Hitler. And the leading issue,
C05 1360 10    that of piecemeal aggression, remains the same. This
C05 1370  6    is drama enough.
C05 1370  9       Do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade?
C05 1380  8    In the thirties we would not face our enemy; that was
C05 1390  7    a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element.
C05 1400  4    Now we have stood up to the Communists; we are stronger
C05 1410  1    and more self-confident- and Low cannot so easily put
C05 1410 11    us to rights.
C05 1420  1       Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie
C05 1420 10    elsewhere? It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities
C05 1430 11    and that they do not outrage him now. He writes, "Confucius
C05 1440  9    held that in times of stress one should take short
C05 1450  7    views- only up to lunchtime".
C05 1460  1       Whatever the cause, his mood in the fifties rarely
C05 1460 10    rises above the level of the capably sardonic. Dulles?
C05 1470  8    He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the
C05 1480  6    man. McCarthy? The skies turn dark but the clouds do
C05 1490  5    not loose their wrath. Suez? Low seems to have supported
C05 1500  2    Eden at first and then relented because things worked
C05 1500 11    out differently, so there is no fire in his eye.
C05 1510  9    #@#
C05 1510 10    Stalin's death, Churchill's farewell to public life,
C05 1520  6    Hillary and Tensing on Everest, Quemoy and Matsu- all
C05 1530  5    subjects for a noble anger or an accolade. Instead
C05 1540  2    the cartoons seem to deal with foibles. Their Eisenhower
C05 1550  1    is insubstantial. Did Low decide to let well enough
C05 1550 10    alone when he made his selections?
C05 1560  5       He often drew the bomb. He showed puny men attacked
C05 1570  3    by splendidly tyrannical machines. And Khrushchev turned
C05 1580  1    out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist
C05 1580 11    of them all. But, but and but.
C05 1590  5       Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion
C05 1600  3    for virtues and vices on the heroic scale. Read the
C05 1600 13    moderately brief text, not for captions, sometimes
C05 1610  7    for tart epigrams, once in a while for an explosion
C05 1620  7    in the middle of your fixed ideas.
C05 1630  1       A gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man,
C05 1630 12    city slicker, lebensraum specialist- tries to take
C05 1640  6    over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from
C05 1650  5    Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community.
C05 1660  3       The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives
C05 1670  2    from New Orleans, accompanied by one wharf rat. But
C05 1670 11    like all despots, as he builds his following from among
C05 1680  9    the gullible, he grows more threatening toward those
C05 1690  5    who won't follow- such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon;
C05 1700  4    Judge Black, the vegetarian black snake; and the eagle,
C05 1710  4    who leads the bird community when he is not too busy
C05 1710 15    in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.
C05 1720  7       As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the
C05 1730  8    populace he imports more wharf rats, who, of course,
C05 1740  3    say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination
C05 1750  1    campaign in the city. (The followers of bullies invariably
C05 1760  9    are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do
C05 1770  5    to others.) They train the mink and other animals to
C05 1780  5    fight. And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that
C05 1790  1    he won't have anyone around that's against him, and
C05 1790 10    setting out to break his second territorial treaty
C05 1800  7    with the birds.
C05 1800 10       Robert Hillyer, the poet, writes in his introduction
C05 1810  8    to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to
C05 1820  7    win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series. He may
C05 1830  5    have a point in urging that decadent themes be given
C05 1840  2    fewer prizes. But it's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as
C05 1840 12    a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but
C05 1850  9    not really momentous fables.
C05 1860  2       In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern
C05 1870  1    dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris (Uncle
C05 1870  9    Remus) and the polished, witty fables of James Thurber.
