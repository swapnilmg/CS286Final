J69 0010  1    The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic
J69 0010 11    form in the operands of those instructions which refer
J69 0020  7    to the particular items: channel, unit, combined channel
J69 0030  5    and unit, combined arm and file, unit record synchronizers,
J69 0040  3    inquiry synchronizers, and alteration switches. The
J69 0050  2    declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic
J69 0050 10    names to item numbers (see page 85).
J69 0060  7    _CONTINUATION CARDS_
J69 0060  9       Certain Autocoder statements make provision for
J69 0070  5    more parameters than may be contained in the operand
J69 0080  4    (columns 21-75) of a single line on the Autocoder coding
J69 0090  2    sheet. When this is the case, the appropriate section
J69 0090 11    of this manual will indicate that "Continuation Cards"
J69 0100  7    may be used. Thus, when specifically permitted, the
J69 0110  5    operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet
J69 0120  3    may be continued in the operand of from one to four
J69 0130  2    additional lines which immediately follow.
J69 0130  7       The label and operation columns must be blank and
J69 0140  7    the continuation of the operand must begin in column
J69 0150  5    21; i.e., it must be left-justified in the operand
J69 0160  2    column of the coding sheet. The operand need not extend
J69 0160 12    across the entire operand column of either the header
J69 0170  9    card or continuation cards but may end with the comma
J69 0180  8    following any parameter. Remarks may appear to the
J69 0190  4    right of the last parameter on each card provided they
J69 0200  1    are separated from the operand by at least two blank
J69 0200 11    spaces.
J69 0200 12       Illustration of the use of continuation cards are
J69 0210  8    included throughout the examples illustrating the various
J69 0220  5    statements.
J69 0220  6       If a continuation card follows a statement that
J69 0230  6    does not permit continuation cards, the compiler will
J69 0240  4    generate a NOP and issue an error message. Additional
J69 0250  1    restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards
J69 0250  8    with macro-instructions appear on page 106.
J69 0260  5    #RESERVATION OF INDEX WORDS AND ELECTRONIC SWITCHES#
J69 0270  3    The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index
J69 0280  2    word and electronic switch names occurs in Phase III
J69 0280 11    of the Autocoder processor. The initial availability
J69 0290  6    of index words and electronic switches is determined
J69 0300  4    by a table which is included in the Compiler Systems
J69 0310  2    Tape. This table originally indicates that index words
J69 0320  1    1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are
J69 0320 11    available for assignment to symbolic references; index
J69 0330  6    words 97 through 99 are not available. The initial
J69 0340  5    setting of this table may be altered, however, as described
J69 0350  3    in the 7070/7074 Data Processing System Bulletin "IBM
J69 0360  2    7070/7074 Compiler System: Operating Procedure", form
J69 0370  2    J28-6105.
J69 0370  4       During the first pass of Phase III, references to
J69 0380  2    the actual addresses of index words and electronic
J69 0380 10    switches are collected and the availability table is
J69 0390  8    updated. At the end of this pass, the table indicates
J69 0400  7    which index words and electronic switches are not available
J69 0410  4    for assignment to symbolic references.
J69 0420  1       Both index words and electronic switches may have
J69 0420  9    been made unavailable before the start of assignment
J69 0430  6    in one of the following ways:
J69 0440  1    _1._
J69 0440  1       The initial setting of the availability table indicated
J69 0440  9    that the index word or electronic switch was not available
J69 0450  9    for assignment.
J69 0460  1    _2._
J69 0460  1       The one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic
J69 0460 13    switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine
J69 0470 10    instruction to specify indexing or as a parameter which
J69 0480  7    is always an index word or electronic switch, e.g.,
J69 0490  3    @
J69 0490  4    _3._
J69 0490  5       The one- or two-digit number of the index word or
J69 0500  5    electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU
J69 0510  1    statement, e.g., @
J69 0510  4       When the index words or electronic switches are
J69 0520  3    reserved because of actual usage in the statements
J69 0530  1    described above, the position or order of the statements
J69 0530 10    within the program is not important; any such reference
J69 0540  7    will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable
J69 0550  5    at the end of this pass.
J69 0550 11       During the assignment pass of Phase III, index words
J69 0560  9    and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered
J69 0570  7    during assignment. Index words and electronic switches
J69 0580  5    may be reserved in the following ways. The first two
J69 0590  4    methods apply to both index words and electronic switches;
J69 0600  1    the third applies only to index words.
J69 0600  8    _1._
J69 0600  9       During the assignment pass, each instruction is
J69 0610  5    examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index
J69 0620  5    word or electronic switch. When such a reference is
J69 0630  2    found, an actual address is assigned and the availability
J69 0630 11    table is changed so that the assigned index word or
J69 0640  9    switch is no longer available for later assignment.
J69 0650  4    _2._
J69 0650  5       If the one- or two-digit address of an index word
J69 0660  4    or electronic switch is used or is included in the
J69 0660 14    operand of an XRESERVE or SRESERVE statement (see
J69 0670  8    page 99), the corresponding index word or electronic
J69 0680  8    switch is reserved.
J69 0690  1    _3._
J69 0690  2       If a statement has been assigned an address in the
J69 0690 12    index word area
J69 0700  2    _A._
J69 0700  3       by means of an actual label or
J69 0700 10    _B._
J69 0700 11       by means of an ORIGIN statement which refers to
J69 0710  6    an actual address the corresponding index word will
J69 0720  5    be reserved. These entries should normally appear at
J69 0730  3    the beginning of the program or immediately following
J69 0730 11    each LITORIGIN statement. Otherwise, symbolic names
J69 0740  6    may have previously been assigned to these same index
J69 0750  8    words. (This method does not apply to electronic switches.)
J69 0760  6       The preceding methods allow efficient use of index
J69 0770  5    words and electronic switches during a sectionalized
J69 0780  1    or multi-phase program, particularly when used in conjunction
J69 0790  1    with the LITORIGIN statement. Extreme caution should
J69 0800  1    be used, however, to avoid the conflicting usage of
J69 0800 10    an index word or electronic switch which may result
J69 0810  5    from the assignment of more than one name or function
J69 0820  4    to the same address.
J69 0820  8       If the symbolic name or actual address of an index
J69 0830  6    word or electronic switch appears or is included in
J69 0840  2    the operand of an XRELEASE or SRELEASE statement
J69 0850  2    (see page 101), the specified index word or electronic
J69 0850 11    switch will again be made available, regardless of
J69 0860  8    the method by which it was reserved. It will not, however,
J69 0870  7    be used for symbolic assignment until all other index
J69 0880  4    words or electronic switches have been assigned for
J69 0890  1    the first time.
J69 0890  4       If, at any time during the assignment pass, the
J69 0900  2    compiler finds that there are no more index words available
J69 0900 12    for assignment, the warning message "NO MORE INDEX
J69 0910  7    WORDS AVAILABLE" will be placed in the object program
J69 0920  8    listing, the table will be altered to show that index
J69 0930  5    words 1 through 96 are available, and the assignment
J69 0940  1    will continue as before. If the compiler finds that
J69 0940 10    there are no more electronic switches available for
J69 0950  7    assignment, the warning message "NO MORE ELECTRONIC
J69 0960  4    SWITCHES AVAILABLE" will be placed in the object program
J69 0970  4    listing, the table will be altered to show that electronic
J69 0980  1    switches 1 through 30 are available, and assignment
J69 0980  9    will continue as before. The resultant conflicting
J69 0990  6    usage of index words or electronic switches may be
J69 1000  4    avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used,
J69 1010  2    e.g., through the proper use of the EQU, XRELEASE,
J69 1020  1    or SRELEASE statements.
J69 1020  4       As noted in Appendix C, index words 97 through
J69 1030  6    99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names
J69 1040  4    by the compiler; also, index words 93 through 96 may
J69 1050  3    have been made unavailable for assignment.
J69 1050  9    #DECLARATIVE STATEMENTS#
J69 1060  2    Autocoder declarative statements provide the processor
J69 1070  1    with the necessary information to complete the imperative
J69 1070  9    operations properly. Declarative statements are never
J69 1080  6    executed in the object program and should be separated
J69 1090  5    from the program instruction area, placed preferably
J69 1100  2    at its beginning or end. Otherwise, special care must
J69 1100 11    be taken to branch around them so that the program
J69 1110 10    will not attempt to execute something in a data area
J69 1120  6    as an instruction. If the compiler does encounter such
J69 1130  3    statements, a warning message will be issued. 7070/7074
J69 1140  1    Autocoder includes the following declarative statements:
J69 1140  7    DA (Define Area), DC (Define Constant), DRDW (Define
J69 1150  8    Record Definition Word), DSW (Define Switch), DLINE
J69 1170  1    (Define Line), EQU (Equate), CODE, DTF (Define Tape
J69 1180  2    File), DIOCS (Define Input/Output Control System),
J69 1190  1    and DUF (Descriptive Entry for Unit Records). DA,
J69 1190  9    DC, DTF, and DLINE require more than one entry.
J69 1210  1       The DA statement is used to name and define the
J69 1210 11    positions and length of fields within an area. The
J69 1220  8    DC statement is used to name and enter constants into
J69 1230  5    the object program. Since the 7070 and 7074 make use
J69 1240  3    of record definition words (RDWS) to read, write,
J69 1240 11    move, and otherwise examine blocks of storage, the
J69 1250  8    DA and DC statements provide the option of generating
J69 1260  6    RDWS automatically. When so instructed, Autocoder
J69 1270  5    will generate one or more RDWS and assign them successive
J69 1280  5    locations immediately preceding the area(s) with which
J69 1290  3    they are to be associated. An RDW will be of the form
J69 1300  2    **f, where xxxx is the starting location of the area
J69 1300 12    and yyyy is its ending location. These addresses are
J69 1310  8    calculated automatically by the processor.
J69 1320  4       In some cases, it may be more advantageous to assign
J69 1330  3    locations to RDWS associated with DA and DC areas
J69 1340  2    in some other part of storage, i.e., not immediately
J69 1340 11    preceding the DA or DC areas. The DRDW statement
J69 1350  9    may be used for this purpose. The DRDW statement may
J69 1360  9    also be used to generate an RDW defining any area
J69 1370  7    specified by the programmer.
J69 1380  1       As many as ten digital switches may be named and
J69 1380 11    provided by the DSW statement for consideration by
J69 1390  8    the SETSW and LOGIC macro-instructions. Each switch
J69 1400  6    occupies one digit position in a word, can be set ON
J69 1410  8    or OFF, and is considered as logically equivalent to
J69 1420  5    an electronic switch. It cannot, however, be referred
J69 1430  3    to by electronic switch commands, e.g., ESN, BSN,
J69 1440  1    etc. An individual switch or the entire set of switches
J69 1440 11    in a word may be tested or altered as desired.
J69 1450 10       Through use of the DLINE statement, a means is
J69 1460  7    provided for specifying both the editing of fields
J69 1470  5    to be inserted in a print line area and the layout
J69 1480  1    of the area itself. The area may include constant information
J69 1480 11    supplied by the programmer. The area may also be provided
J69 1490 10    with additional data during the running of the object
J69 1500  8    program by means of EDMOV or MOVE macro-instructions.
J69 1510  5       The declarative statement EQU permits the programmer
J69 1520  5    to equate symbolic names to actual index words, electronic
J69 1530  4    switches, arm and file numbers, tape channel and unit
J69 1540  3    numbers, alteration switches, etc., and to equate a
J69 1540 11    symbol to another symbol or to an actual address.
J69 1550  9       The DIOCS, DTF, and DUF statements are used when
J69 1560  8    required by the Input/Output Control System. DIOCS
J69 1570  4    is used to select the major methods of processing to
J69 1580  5    be used, and to name the index words used by IOCS.
J69 1590  3    Each tape file must be described by Tape File Specifications,
J69 1600  1    produced by DTFS. In addition to information related
J69 1610  1    to the file and its records, the File Specifications
J69 1610 10    contain subroutine locations and the location of tape
J69 1620  7    label information. A DUF entry must be supplied for
J69 1630  6    every unit record file describing the type of file
J69 1640  3    and the unit record equipment to be used. The DUF
J69 1640 13    also supplies the locations of subroutines written
J69 1650  7    by the user that are unique to the file.
J69 1660  5       A full description of the DIOCS, DTF, and DUF
J69 1670  4    statements is contained in the 7070 Data Processing
J69 1680  1    system Bulletin "IBM 7070 Input/Output Control System",
J69 1690  1    form J28-6033-1. Brief descriptions of these three
J69 1690 10    declarative statements and detailed descriptions of
J69 1700  6    the formats and functions of each of the other 7070/7074
J69 1710  7    Autocoder declarative statements follow below.
J69 1720  2    _DIOCS- DEFINE INPUT/OUTPUT CONTROL SYSTEM_
J69 1730  1       When the Input/Output Control System is to be used
J69 1730  9    in a program, a DIOCS statement must be used to select
J69 1740  8    the major methods of processing to be used. This statement
J69 1750  6    also allows the naming of the index words used by IOCS.
J69 1760  5    _SOURCE PROGRAM FORMAT_
J69 1760  8       The basic format of the DIOCS statement is as follows:
J69 1770  9    @ ANYLABEL is any symbolic label; it may be omitted.
J69 1780  9    The entry DIOCS must be written exactly as shown.
J69 1790  7       The first item in the operand, IOCSIXF, is used
J69 1800  5    to specify the first IOCS index word for programs
J69 1810  4    using tape files. This item may be a symbolic name
J69 1820  2    or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address
J69 1820 13    in the range 3-94. If the first item in the operand
J69 1830 10    is omitted, the symbolic name IOCSIXF will be assigned.
J69 1840  5    When an actual index word or a symbolic address is
J69 1850  4    specified, Autocoder will equate the name IOCSIXF
J69 1860  1    to it.
J69 1860  3       The second item in the operand, IOCSIXG, is used
J69 1870  3    to specify the second IOCS index word for programs
J69 1880  1    using tape files. This item may be a symbolic name
J69 1880 11    or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address
J69 1890  7    in the range 3-94. If the second item in the operand
J69 1900  5    is omitted, the symbolic name IOCSIXG will be assigned.
J69 1910  4    When an actual index word or a symbolic address is
J69 1920  2    specified, Autocoder will equate IOCSIXG to it.
