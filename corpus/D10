D10 0010  1       MEN need unity and they need God. Care must be taken
D10 0010 12    neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with
D10 0020  9    our parochial ideas about him, but with these two qualifications,
D10 0030  8    the statement stands. The statement also points to
D10 0040  6    a classic paradox: The more men turn toward God, who
D10 0050  4    is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but
D10 0060  1    also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately
D10 0060 11    be established, the more men splinter into groups and
D10 0070  8    set themselves apart from one another. To be reminded
D10 0080  5    of this we need only glance at the world map and note
D10 0090  3    the extent to which religious divisions have compounded
D10 0090 11    political ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the
D10 0100  8    human race. Massacres attending the partition of India
D10 0110  6    and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply
D10 0120  5    recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions
D10 0130  2    can engender. The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly
D10 0135  1    to mind: "Oh how we hate one another for the love of
D10 0140 12    God"!
D10 0150  1       The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify.
D10 0150 11    It lies in institutions. Institutions require structure,
D10 0160  6    form, and definition, and these in turn entail differentiation
D10 0170  7    and exclusion. A completely amorphous institution would
D10 0180  4    be a contradiction in terms; to escape this fate, it
D10 0190  4    must rule some things out. For every criterion which
D10 0200  1    defines what something is, at the same time proclaims-
D10 0200 10    implicitly if not openly- what that something is not.
D10 0210  8    Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose
D10 0220  7    that we do away with institutions altogether; in the
D10 0230  3    present context this amounts to the advice that while
D10 0240  1    being religious may have a certain justification, we
D10 0240  9    ought to dispense with churches. The suggestion is
D10 0250  6    naive. Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating
D10 0260  6    being. Having once committed himself to an ideal which
D10 0270  4    he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms
D10 0280  1    for its expression and institutions for its continuance.
D10 0280  9    To propose that men be religious without having religious
D10 0290  7    institutions is like proposing that they be learned
D10 0300  5    without having schools. Both eventualities are possible
D10 0310  3    logically, but practically they are impossible. As
D10 0310 10    much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded
D10 0320 10    in God, they instrumentally require the institutions
D10 0330  4    that will direct their steps toward him.
D10 0340  2       Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set
D10 0340 11    men at odds with their fellows. Is there any way out
D10 0350 11    of the predicament? The only way that I can see is
D10 0360  9    through communication. Interfaith communication need
D10 0370  3    not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon
D10 0380  2    us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations
D10 0380 10    with our adversaries. Approached creatively, it is
D10 0390  6    a high art. It is the art of relating the finite to
D10 0400  6    the infinite, of doing our best to insure that the
D10 0410  2    particularistic requirements of religious institutions
D10 0410  7    will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more
D10 0420  9    than is minimally necessary. In a certain sense, interfaith
D10 0430  6    communication parallels diplomatic communication among
D10 0440  3    the nation-states.
D10 0440  6       What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication
D10 0450  5    at the present juncture of history? I shall touch on
D10 0460  5    three areas: personal, national, and theological.
D10 0470  1    #I#
D10 0470  2    By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality
D10 0480  1    structure. Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned
D10 0480  8    by theological differences at all, but by the need
D10 0490  8    of men to have persons they can blame, distrust, denounce,
D10 0500  5    and even hate. Such needs may rise to pathological
D10 0510  3    proportions. Modern psychology has shown that paralleling
D10 0520  1    "the authoritarian personality" is "the bigoted personality"
D10 0530  1    in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust
D10 0530  8    combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable
D10 0540  9    that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally.
D10 0550  7    Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears
D10 0560  4    to be quite small, but it would be a mistake to think
D10 0570  3    that more than a matter of degree separates them from
D10 0570 13    the rest of us. To some extent the personal inadequacies
D10 0580 10    that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be
D10 0590  8    found in all of us.
D10 0590 13       Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological
D10 0600  6    deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all, for they
D10 0610  6    have no redeeming features whatsoever. It is difficult
D10 0620  4    to say what can be done about them except that we must
D10 0630  1    learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts
D10 0630 11    for them, that are causing the trouble, and do everything
D10 0640  9    possible to nurture the healthy personalities that
D10 0650  4    will prevent the development of such deficiencies.
D10 0660  1    #II#
D10 0660  2    While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith
D10 0670  1    conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable.
D10 0670  9    The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian
D10 0680 11    version which has gained prominence only in this second
D10 0690  8    half of the twentieth century.
D10 0700  1       Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination,
D10 0700  9    the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that
D10 0710 10    has undone empires. No less than twenty-two nations
D10 0720  7    have already achieved independence since World War
D10 0730  4    II, and the number is growing by the year. As an obvious
D10 0740  3    consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication
D10 0750  1    have grown more formidable in one important area: relations
D10 0750 10    between Christians and non-Christians in these lands.
D10 0760  8    Colonialism alone would have been able to make these
D10 0770  7    difficulties serious, for Christianity is so closely
D10 0780  4    tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that
D10 0790  1    repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward
D10 0790  9    the repudiation of the other. Actually, however, this
D10 0800  7    turns out to be only part of the picture. Nationalism
D10 0810  4    has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions
D10 0820  2    but the revival of native ones, some of which had been
D10 0820 13    lying in slumber for centuries. The truth is that any
D10 0830 10    revival of traditional and indigenous religion will
D10 0840  5    serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist
D10 0850  3    which these young nations very much need. Insofar as
D10 0860  2    these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways
D10 0860 10    of life which constitute ultimate, trans-political
D10 0870  6    justifications for their existence, such people are
D10 0880  4    inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these
D10 0890  2    traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone
D10 0890 10    else's.
D10 0900  1       All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural
D10 0910  1    communication for which Christian missions stand. Africans
D10 0910  8    and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the
D10 0920  9    local churches they have produced as centers and agents
D10 0930  6    of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political
D10 0940  4    propaganda. The people hardest hit by this suspicion
D10 0950  1    are, of course, Christians on the mainland of China.
D10 0950 10    But the problem extends elsewhere. For example, in
D10 0960  7    Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism
D10 0970  4    ought to be the official state religion. In 1960 Ceylon
D10 0980  4    nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly Christian-
D10 0990  3    schools, to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000
D10 0990 12    Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics.
D10 1000  8    Again, India has imposed formidable barriers against
D10 1010  4    the entrance of additional missionaries, and fanatical
D10 1020  3    Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against
D10 1030  1    Christians once the influence making for tolerance
D10 1030  8    due to Nehru and his followers is gone.
D10 1040  6       The progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the
D10 1050  4    Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I
D10 1060  2    had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to
D10 1060 11    Cairo. I was seated next to the director of the Seventh
D10 1070  9    Day Adventists' world radio program. He said that on
D10 1080  7    his tour the preceding year a considerable number of
D10 1090  3    hours would have been available to him on Japanese
D10 1090 12    radio networks, but that he had then lacked the funds
D10 1100 10    to contract for them. After returning to the United
D10 1110  6    States and raising the money, he discovered on getting
D10 1120  4    back to Japan that the hours were no longer available.
D10 1130  1    It was not that they had been contracted for during
D10 1130 11    the interval; they simply could no longer be purchased
D10 1140  8    for missionary purposes. It is not unfair to add on
D10 1150  8    the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic
D10 1160  2    approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the
D10 1160  9    cultures and religions among which they work has contributed
D10 1170  9    measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment.
D10 1180  6    Ironically, these are the groups which have doubled
D10 1190  5    or tripled their missionary efforts since World War
D10 1200  3    II, while the more established denominations are barely
D10 1210  1    maintaining pre-war staffs.
D10 1210  5       Although I have emphasized the barriers which an
D10 1220  4    aroused nationalism has raised against relations between
D10 1230  1    Christians and non-Christians in Asia, the fact is
D10 1230 10    that this development has also widened the gulf between
D10 1240  7    certain Afro-Asian religions themselves. The partition
D10 1250  4    of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus
D10 1260  3    and Muslims; neither has the establishment of the State
D10 1270  2    of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews.
D10 1270 10    #III#
D10 1280  1    I turn finally to several theological developments.
D10 1280  8    _1._
D10 1290  1       Theocracy reconsidered. The modern world has been
D10 1290  7    marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine
D10 1300  6    sanction for the state, whatever its political form.
D10 1310  4    The American Constitution was historic at this point
D10 1320  3    in providing that "Congress shall make no law respecting
D10 1330  1    an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
D10 1330  9    exercise thereof". One of our foremost jurists, David
D10 1340  7    Dudley Field, has gone so far as to call this provision
D10 1350  7    "the greatest achievement ever made in the course of
D10 1360  4    human history".
D10 1360  6       The trend throughout the world's religions has been
D10 1370  4    toward a recognition of at least the practical validity
D10 1380  2    of this constitutional enactment. Pakistan was created
D10 1380  9    in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army
D10 1390 11    took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of
D10 1400 10    mass impatience which was directed in part against
D10 1410  4    the inability of political and religious leaders to
D10 1410 12    think their way through to the meaning of Islam for
D10 1420 10    the modern political situation. "What is the point",
D10 1430  6    Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking, "in
D10 1440  4    demanding an Islamic state and society if no one, not
D10 1450  3    even the doctors of the sacred law themselves, can
D10 1450 12    say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such
D10 1460  8    a state and society is"? The current regime of President
D10 1470  6    Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular. And while
D10 1480  4    the nation was formerly named "The Islamic Republic
D10 1490  2    of Pakistan", it is now simply "The Republic of Pakistan".
D10 1500  1       Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere. The new
D10 1500  9    regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than
D10 1510  8    its predecessor. The religious parties in Israel have
D10 1520  6    experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months.
D10 1530  4    During the years when Israel was passing from crisis
D10 1540  2    to crisis- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes
D10 1540 11    of penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose
D10 1550  9    of national unity could be best served if the secular
D10 1560  8    majority were to yield to the religious parties. Now
D10 1570  3    that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction
D10 1580  1    of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise.
D10 1590  1    And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of
D10 1590  9    the line between the sacral and secular orders during
D10 1600  7    the last presidential campaign served to provide a
D10 1610  5    most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical
D10 1620  2    autonomy of both church and state. The failure at that
D10 1620 12    time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes
D10 1630 10    of their people added a ring of good sense to Father
D10 1640  8    Weigel's theological argument. Everywhere there seems
D10 1650  4    to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments
D10 1660  2    and religious institutions alike are too fallible and
D10 1660 10    corruptible- in a word, too human- to warrant any claim
D10 1670 12    of maintaining partnership with the divine.
D10 1680  5    _2._
D10 1680  6       Salvation reconsidered. My father went as a missionary
D10 1690  6    to China in a generation that responded to Student
D10 1700  3    Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their
D10 1700 11    hands and announced to the students in their audiences
D10 1710  9    how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second
D10 1720  8    because these students were not over there saving them.
D10 1730  5    That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips
D10 1740  3    today is as clear an indication as we could wish of
D10 1740 14    the extent to which attitudes have changed. I do not
D10 1750  9    mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal
D10 1760  5    assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism, that all religions
D10 1770  4    are merely different paths to the same summit. Leslie
D10 1780  1    Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the
D10 1780  8    World Council of Churches when he says, "We must claim
D10 1790  9    absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished
D10 1800  6    work, but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness
D10 1810  5    and finality for our understanding of it". Newbiggin's
D10 1820  2    qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable
D10 1830  1    significance. The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated
D10 1830  8    one of its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that
D10 1840  8    there is no salvation outside the visible church. In
D10 1850  6    mentioning this under "salvation reconsidered" I do
D10 1860  4    not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has
D10 1870  2    changed in this area but rather that it has become
D10 1870 12    clearer to the world community what that doctrine is.
