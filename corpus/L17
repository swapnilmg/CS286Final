L17 0010  1       The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next
L17 0010  9    to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads
L17 0020  8    to Captain Harris's office (to the left), the lieutenant's
L17 0030  6    office (farther along and to the left) and the janitor's
L17 0040  5    supply closet (straight ahead).
L17 0040  9       The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight
L17 0050  9    batteries, a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint
L17 0060  7    cards, a stack of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets from
L17 0070  4    last year, and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps.
L17 0080  3    Gun set the captain's fifth of Hiram Walker inside
L17 0090  1    the safe before he reported to Lt. Killpath, though
L17 0090 10    he knew that Killpath's ulcer prevented him from making
L17 0100  7    any untoward incursion on Herman Wolff's gift. It was
L17 0110  6    more a matter of tact, and also it was none of Killpath's
L17 0120  5    goddam business.
L17 0120  7       He walked up to the lieutenant's office, leaned
L17 0130  4    wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles
L17 0140  3    and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine
L17 0150  1    gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy
L17 0150 10    Range. He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred
L17 0160  9    and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes.
L17 0170  2       "Where's the Lieut"?
L17 0170  5       The clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office.
L17 0180  8    Gun went to the connecting door, which was open, and
L17 0190  6    stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath,
L17 0200  2    in full uniform, finished combing his hair.
L17 0210  1       The lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded,
L17 0210  9    and as Killpath raked the comb through it, it stuck
L17 0220  8    together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella
L17 0230  5    ribs clinging to his pink skull. The lieutenant eyed
L17 0240  2    Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and
L17 0240 11    then glanced back at his own face, moving the comb
L17 0250 10    methodically around his head.
L17 0260  2       Leave me alone, Gun thought. Fight with Sam Schaeffer,
L17 0270  1    fight with the whole damned Bureau. But leave me alone.
L17 0270 11    Because I'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed
L17 0280 11    that old man, and I'm going to get him. If you just
L17 0290  8    leave me to hell alone, Lieutenant.
L17 0300  1       Killpath peered through half-closed lids at his
L17 0300  9    reflection, thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction
L17 0310 10    and about-faced.
L17 0320  1       Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk
L17 0320 11    near the window. He sat stiff-backed in a chair that
L17 0330  9    did not swivel, though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath
L17 0340  6    felt his position as acting captain plainly merited
L17 0350  2    a swivel chair. The desk before him was in no better
L17 0350 13    repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into
L17 0360  9    the room, including wooden file cabinets with some
L17 0370  5    of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with
L17 0380  3    the roof seepage of countless seasons.
L17 0380  9       Killpath pulled one thin leg up, clamping his arms
L17 0390  9    around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly
L17 0400  6    scrawny gut. It was the posture which the men had come
L17 0410  4    to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer.
L17 0410 13    He put his chin on his kneecap, stretching his neck
L17 0420 10    like that of a turkey on a chopping block, and stared
L17 0430  7    wordlessly at his sergeant.
L17 0440  1       Gun waited.
L17 0440  3       The 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside
L17 0450  1    doors bang shut, closing in the assembled day watch.
L17 0450 10       Finally, Orville intoned through his hawk nose,
L17 0460  7    "We can't have people running in any time they please,
L17 0470  6    Sergeant".
L17 0470  7       "No, sir". "Running in, running out. Can't have
L17 0480  6    it. Makes for confusion and congestion". He rocked
L17 0490  4    back in the chair, knee locked against stomach, his
L17 0500  2    beady eyes fixed on Matson.
L17 0500  7       He was silent again, possibly listening to the sounds
L17 0510  5    in the squadroom. Roll was being called. Gun cleared
L17 0520  3    his throat.
L17 0520  5       Killpath said, "You were expected to report to my
L17 0540  2    office twenty minutes ago, Sergeant. That's not getting
L17 0550  1    all the juice out of the orange, now is it"?
L17 0550 11       "No, sir".
L17 0560  1       Then Killpath smiled. Gun knew that nothing but
L17 0560  9    aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer
L17 0570  9    and a smile at the same time.
L17 0580  1       The day-watch platoon commander, Lt. Rinker, was
L17 0580  9    calling out the beat assignments, but Matson couldn't
L17 0590  8    make the names mean anything.
L17 0600  2       "I called the station at three this morning", Killpath's
L17 0610  2    nasal voice pronounced. "Do you have any idea who might
L17 0620  1    have been in charge at the time"?
L17 0620  8       "Sergeant Vaughn, sir".
L17 0630  2       "Now, now, you're just guessing, Sergeant". He smiled
L17 0640  2    thinly, savoring his joke. "What if I said nobody was
L17 0640 12    here but a couple of patrolmen"?
L17 0650  6       "Sir, Vaughn knows better than to leave the station
L17 0660  6    without a relief. He must have"-
L17 0670  1       "He let a patrolman take over the duties of the
L17 0670 11    station keeper. Now that's not regulation, is it"?
L17 0680  6       "No, sir".
L17 0690  1       "But you didn't know a thing about it, did you"?
L17 0690 10    Killpath leaned forward; his foot slipped off the chair
L17 0700  8    and he put it back again, frowning now. "That's not
L17 0710  5    taking one's command with a responsible attitude, Matson".
L17 0720  3       Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool.
L17 0730  4    But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank.
L17 0740  1       "I was out in the district, sir".
L17 0740  8       "Oh, yes. So I have heard". He stretched a pale
L17 0750  8    hand out to the scattered papers on his desk. "I might
L17 0760  6    point out that your inability to report to my office
L17 0770  3    this morning when you were instructed to do so has
L17 0770 13    not ... ah ... limited my knowledge of your activities
L17 0780  8    as you may have hoped". He took up a white sheet of
L17 0790  8    paper, dark with single-spaced data.
L17 0800  1       A car pulled into the driveway outside the window.
L17 0800 10    Gun knew it was Car 12, the wagon, returned from delivering
L17 0810  9    Ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail.
L17 0820  5    But for some fool reason he couldn't remember which
L17 0830  3    men he'd put on the transfer detail. He stared at the
L17 0840  3    report in Killpath's hand, sure it was written by Accacia-
L17 0850  3    just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled
L17 0850 14    longhand. He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while
L17 0860  9    Killpath laid down the sheet again, wound the gold-wire
L17 0870  6    stems of his glasses around his ears and then, eying
L17 0880  3    the report as it lay before him on the desk, intoned,
L17 0880 14    "Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see
L17 0890  8    that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented
L17 0900  7    himself throughout the entire watch without checking
L17 0910  4    on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his
L17 0920  3    section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide
L17 0930  1    Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their
L17 0930 10    own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented
L17 0940  7    from carrying on his proper assignment four failed
L17 0950  4    to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T.
L17 0960  3    Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five
L17 0970  1    frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours
L17 0970  8    spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly
L17 0980  7    social nature and six"- he leaned back and peeled off
L17 0990  9    his glasses "- failed to co-operate with the Acting
L17 1000  4    Captain by returning promptly when so ordered. What
L17 1010  1    have you to say to that, Sergeant"? Killpath sailed
L17 1010 10    the paper across the desk, but Matson didn't pick it
L17 1020  9    up or even glance at it.
L17 1030  1       "Well"?
L17 1030  2       "I didn't think Accacia knew so many big words,
L17 1040  4    Lieutenant".
L17 1040  5       Killpath licked his lips. "Patrolman Accacia is
L17 1050  3    an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer.
L17 1060  1    I don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence,
L17 1060  9    Matson".
L17 1070  1       "Negligence, hell"! Gun held his breath a moment,
L17 1071  1    pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under
L17 1080 10    the trapdoor in his throat. "Sir. I would have been
L17 1090  7    negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot, if I'd sat
L17 1100  5    around this station all night when somebody got away
L17 1110  2    with murder in my district. It's too bad I didn't call
L17 1110 13    you, and it's too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when
L17 1120 11    he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something
L17 1130 10    of Homicide procedure. But I'm not one damned bit sorry
L17 1140  8    I went out to question the people I know in the places
L17 1150  6    they hang around, and"-
L17 1150 10       "Let's not push our patience beyond the danger line,
L17 1160  9    Sergeant", Killpath nasaled. "I shouldn't like to have
L17 1170  7    to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction
L17 1180  5    of duty".
L17 1180  7       Gun stiffened, his hands balling into fists at his
L17 1190  6    sides. He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling
L17 1200  4    out. An argument with Orville Torrence Killpath was
L17 1210  2    as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing
L17 1210 14    range.
L17 1220  1       Killpath leaned forward again, rocked comfortably
L17 1220  7    with his arms still wrapped around one knee. "Let's
L17 1230  7    just remember, Sergeant, that we must all carry our
L17 1240  7    own umbrella. A district station can't run smoothly,
L17 1250  3    unless"- He interrupted himself, looking around Gun
L17 1260  1    at the doorway. "Morning, Lieutenant Rinker".
L17 1260  7       "Sorry, Orville. I thought you hadn't come in yet".
L17 1270  9       "I've been here for some time". He stood up, cocked
L17 1280 10    his head and eyed Gun coldly. "The sergeant is just
L17 1290  6    leaving".
L17 1290  7    ##
L17 1290  8    It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the
L17 1300  8    hot water in the showers didn't work, that Loren Severe
L17 1310  5    had thrown up all over the stairs, or that some thieving
L17 1320  3    bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes.
L17 1320 13    It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had
L17 1330 13    ended with a session in Killpath's office.
L17 1340  4       Now, as he passed the open counter that divided
L17 1350  3    the assembly room from the business office, he nodded
L17 1360  1    and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks,
L17 1360 12    not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his
L17 1370  9    chewing out.
L17 1370 11       Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent
L17 1380  8    out about Killpath's little speech on the comportment
L17 1390  4    of platoon commanders. He just didn't want to talk
L17 1400  3    about it. If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant
L17 1410  1    to sit on his ass around the station all night, Killpath
L17 1410 12    would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the
L17 1420 11    heels once an hour; because he'd be damned if he was
L17 1430  7    going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please
L17 1440  3    his ulcerated pro-tem captain.
L17 1440  8       At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning
L17 1450  6    overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes,
L17 1460  3    remembering then that he'd left them at the Doughnuttery.
L17 1470  1    He could pick up another pack on his way home, if he
L17 1470 13    were going home. But even before he started across
L17 1480  8    the oiled road to his Plymouth, parked in the lot under
L17 1490  6    the cypress trees across from the station, he knew
L17 1500  3    that he wasn't going home.
L17 1500  8       Not yet.
L17 1500 10       It was nine o'clock in the morning: the hour which,
L17 1510 10    like a spade turning clods of earth, exposed to the
L17 1520  7    day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant
L17 1530  4    in the quiet night. Mission Street at this hour was
L17 1540  1    populated by a whole community that Gun could not have
L17 1540 11    seen on his tour of duty- the neighborhood that had
L17 1550  8    known Urbano Quintana by day.
L17 1560  2    #TEN#
L17 1560  3    Sol Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart
L17 1570  2    seventeen years ago. It was professedly worth three
L17 1570 10    thousand dollars in stock and good will, and the name
L17 1580  9    was written in gold in foot-high letters across each
L17 1590  4    of the two display windows.
L17 1590  9       On the right window, at eye level, in smaller print
L17 1600  8    but also in gold, was Gonzalez, Prop., and under that,
L17 1610  5    Se Habla Espanol. Mr. Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez,
L17 1620  6    Prop., but left the promise that Spanish would be understood
L17 1630  6    because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele
L17 1640  2    would be welcome. Language was no problem anyway; Mr.
L17 1650  2    Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon
L17 1650 12    aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played
L17 1660  7    on the sidewalks of Mission Street.
L17 1670  2       Aside from the fact that business was slow this
L17 1680  1    time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most
L17 1690 11    enterprising, Mr. Phillips had no worries at all, and
L17 1700  8    he said as much to Gun Matson, who sat across from
L17 1710  5    him in civilian clothes, on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed, mauve
L17 1720  2    velour, $79.89 nothing-down special!
L17 1720  7       "She's honest as the day", Mr. Phillips said, and
L17 1730  8    added, "Mr. Gunnar, I can say this to you: Beebe is
L17 1740  9    a little too honest. You can't tell a customer how
L17 1750  5    much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments
L17 1760  1    before he even signs for a loan on the money down!
L17 1760 12    A time plan is a mere convenience, you understand,
L17 1770  7    and when"- He interrupted himself, smiling. "I put
L17 1780  5    her in lamps. That way I don't lose so much".
L17 1790  3       "Why don't you just hire somebody else"?
