E36 0010  1       There comes a time in the lives of most of us when
E36 0010 13    we want to be alone. Not necessarily to be off all
E36 0020  9    by ourselves, but away from the crowds and common happenstance.
E36 0030  5    If you've travelled in Europe a time or two, it is
E36 0040  6    quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone
E36 0050  1    feeling or that you will get it on your next visit
E36 0050 12    across the Atlantic. Following a guide, and gratefully
E36 0060  6    so, is an excellent way to see all the important places
E36 0070  6    when everything is strange and new. However, after
E36 0080  2    you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas,
E36 0080 10    the places and forums, the churches and museums, the
E36 0090  9    palaces and castles, and begin to feel at home in the
E36 0100  9    capitals of Europe, you'll want to change your course
E36 0110  4    and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market
E36 0120  1    places.
E36 0120  2       The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital
E36 0130  1    of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste
E36 0130  9    somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de
E36 0140  9    la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You can relive history
E36 0150  4    and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest
E36 0160  1    for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi,
E36 0160 11    an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you
E36 0170 10    don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which
E36 0180  6    has remained almost untouched by time and tourists
E36 0190  3    since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb
E36 0200  1    the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging
E36 0200  9    to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book
E36 0210  7    towns, perched atop lofty crags, their faces turned
E36 0220  4    to the sea. They've been there since the days of the
E36 0230  3    Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end
E36 0230 13    a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a
E36 0240 10    squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean?
E36 0250  5       An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth
E36 0260  5    on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the
E36 0270  3    wheel of a car and head for the open road.
E36 0270 13       For those who need or want and can afford another
E36 0280  9    car, buying one and driving it on the grand tour, then
E36 0290  7    shipping it home, is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself
E36 0300  5    pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us
E36 0310  1    who either do not want or need or cannot afford another
E36 0310 12    car. The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone
E36 0320 10    and arrange to rent one. It is that elemental.
E36 0330  5       Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you.
E36 0340  5    You can call one of the car rental services directly
E36 0350  1    (Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others)
E36 0350  9    and ask them to reserve a car of your choice, and some
E36 0360 11    transportation lines offer this service as well. With
E36 0370  7    few exceptions, your car will be waiting for you at
E36 0380  4    dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you
E36 0390  1    arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait,
E36 0390 10    of course, until you arrive in Europe before renting
E36 0400  7    your car. The disadvantages to this method are that
E36 0410  6    you may not have as great a choice of models readily
E36 0420  2    available or you may have to wait a few days or, during
E36 0420 14    the busy tourist season, when cars are in great demand,
E36 0430  9    you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at
E36 0440  7    all. Since charges are relatively the same, reserving
E36 0450  3    a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of
E36 0460  1    having one on tap when you want it.
E36 0460  9       For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route
E36 0470  6    and return by another some agencies offer a service
E36 0480  3    whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival
E36 0480 15    and leave it in another city, or even another country,
E36 0490  9    when you are ready to return home. At some cities,
E36 0500  6    this pick-up and delivery service is without additional
E36 0510  2    charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning
E36 0520  1    your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free
E36 0520 10    delivery and collection stations in major cities within
E36 0530  8    the larger European countries.
E36 0540  1       International Touring Documents are usually provided
E36 0550  1    with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid
E36 0550 13    American driving license is accepted in all countries
E36 0560  8    except Portugal, Spain, Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe.
E36 0570  2    If you plan to visit any of these countries, you can
E36 0580  3    obtain your International Driving Permit before you
E36 0590  1    leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance,
E36 0590 10    too, with most agencies, is provided with the car,
E36 0600  8    covering comprehensive fire, theft, liability and collision
E36 0610  5    with a deductible clause which varies in different
E36 0620  3    countries. If you would feel happier with full collision
E36 0630  1    insurance, there is a small additional charge, again
E36 0630  9    varying from country to country and depending on the
E36 0640  7    term of such insurance. The average charge for this
E36 0650  4    additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day.
E36 0660  1    The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as
E36 0660 11    50@ a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in
E36 0670 10    Greece.
E36 0670 11       Rental fees are variable, too, throughout the countries
E36 0680  7    of Europe. There are as many rates as there are countries
E36 0690  7    and models of cars available. As in the United States,
E36 0700  4    there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few
E36 0710  3    cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops
E36 0710 13    if the car is retained for a week. It drops again after
E36 0720 10    fifteen and/or twenty-one days.
E36 0730  2       It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost
E36 0730 13    from 80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States
E36 0740 11    gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford,
E36 0750  8    Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, which are available in
E36 0760  5    some countries, it is probably wiser to choose the
E36 0770  2    smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five
E36 0770 10    and even forty miles to the gallon.
E36 0780  7       Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed
E36 0790  3    by the number of people travelling in your group. With
E36 0800  2    the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny
E36 0800 12    sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing
E36 0810  8    to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical
E36 0820  5    transportation. There is a large variety of models
E36 0830  3    to choose from in most countries, however, including
E36 0830 11    6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental
E36 0840  8    fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans.
E36 0850  8       The basic costs are generally pretty much the same
E36 0860  5    regardless of the agency through which you reserve
E36 0870  2    your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages.
E36 0880  1    There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it
E36 0880 12    there" service, as an example, the free delivery and
E36 0900  8    collection at the airport, dockside or your hotel,
E36 0910  4    luggage racks, touring documents and information and
E36 0920  2    other similar services. A little investigation by telephone
E36 0920 10    or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines
E36 0930  9    will give you these pertinent details on the additional
E36 0940  6    money-saving benefits. The investigation will be well
E36 0950  4    worth your time.
E36 0950  7       All model cars are not available in all countries.
E36 0960  5    Quite naturally, there is a greater availability of
E36 0970  2    those models which are manufactured within a specific
E36 0970 10    country. If you would like to start your tour in Italy,
E36 0980 11    where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe,
E36 0990  8    Fiats in all sizes are available, as are Alfa Romeo
E36 1000  5    Giulietta models. If you wish to budget closely on
E36 1010  3    transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge
E36 1010 10    in luxuries, one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at
E36 1020  9    only $1.26 a day plus 3@ a kilometer and the Fiat 2100
E36 1025  7    Station Wagon, seating six, at just $1.10 a day and
E36 1040  5    10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car
E36 1050  1    more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the
E36 1050 10    daily rates drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the
E36 1060 10    Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal 30@ a day for the
E36 1070  6    Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the group, the
E36 1080  3    cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the
E36 1080 15    daily fee.
E36 1090  2       In the majority of countries, however, the rates
E36 1090 10    range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans
E36 1100 10    and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger,
E36 1110  8    luxury European models, with the rate per kilometer
E36 1120  3    driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@.
E36 1130  1    The same model car might be available in six or eight
E36 1130 12    countries, yet not two countries will have the same
E36 1140  8    rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer
E36 1150  5    driven. The variations are not too great. Rates for
E36 1160  2    American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about
E36 1160 10    $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible,
E36 1170 10    but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same
E36 1180  7    as for the larger European models. Rates in Greece
E36 1190  4    and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest in
E36 1200  2    Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite
E36 1200 10    high in Ireland.
E36 1210  1       If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than
E36 1210 11    a month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The
E36 1220 13    actual over-all cost, for the first month, will perhaps
E36 1230  8    not be too much lower than the rental charges for the
E36 1240  5    same period of time, but you will receive a new car.
E36 1250  2    You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new
E36 1250 13    car owner, which includes the factory guarantee and
E36 1260  7    the services valid at authorized dealers throughout
E36 1270  3    Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge or mileage
E36 1280  3    limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only
E36 1280 13    the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents
E36 1290  9    and insurance since the car is registered and insured
E36 1300  7    individually for your trip. There is a fairly wide
E36 1310  4    selection of models of English, German and French manufacture
E36 1320  1    from which you can choose from the very small Austin
E36 1320 11    7, Citroe^n 2 CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger
E36 1330  9    Simca Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as
E36 1340 11    popular as renting a car in Europe, but for long periods
E36 1350  8    it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory.
E36 1360  3    After the first month, rates are considerably less,
E36 1370  2    averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger
E36 1380  1    models.
E36 1380  2       There are reasons for some people not wanting to
E36 1380 11    rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For
E36 1390 11    one thing, the driver usually sees less and has less
E36 1400  7    fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary
E36 1410  3    for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then,
E36 1420  1    too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat
E36 1420  9    crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly
E36 1430  9    keen on getting mixed up with them. Still there is
E36 1440  7    a way for those who want to see some of the back country
E36 1450  5    of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven
E36 1460  1    car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it
E36 1460 11    to be.
E36 1470  1       Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00
E36 1470  8    to $12.00 a day, but this charge is the same whether
E36 1480 10    you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger
E36 1490  7    Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big spread is in the charge
E36 1500  6    for each kilometer driven, being governed by the rate
E36 1510  3    at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European
E36 1510 11    cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than
E36 1520  8    American cars, it naturally follows that the cost per
E36 1530  6    kilometer for these models will be less, but the greater
E36 1540  4    seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize
E36 1550  1    this, provided your group is sufficiently large to
E36 1550  9    fill a 7-passenger limousine.
E36 1560  2       The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars
E36 1570  1    vary in the different countries in the same manner
E36 1570 10    as they do for the drive-yourself cars. However, whether
E36 1580  7    you arrange to have a European or American model, if
E36 1590  5    you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in
E36 1600  2    relation to the number of people in your party, your
E36 1600 12    transportation expense will average very close to $10.00
E36 1610  8    per day per passenger. This will include your helpful,
E36 1620  6    English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average
E36 1630  5    of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater
E36 1640  1    distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface
E36 1640 10    and will never discover the enchantment, fascination
E36 1650  6    and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore
E36 1660  8    the hinterlands. Of course, if you want to throw all
E36 1670  5    caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac
E36 1680  1    limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have
E36 1680 10    a memorable tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is
E36 1690 10    not recommended unless you own a producing oil well
E36 1700  5    or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.
