A22 0010  1       Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday
A22 0010  8    that it was prepared to accept students of any race
A22 0020 10    as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible.
A22 0030  8       "Emory University's charter and by-laws have never
A22 0040  7    required admission or rejection of students on the
A22 0050  4    basis of race", board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated.
A22 0060  2       But an official statement adopted by the 33-man
A22 0060 11    Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that
A22 0070  9    state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock
A22 0080  6    to accepting Negroes.
A22 0080  9       The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution
A22 0090  7    and state law, tax-exempt status is granted to educational
A22 0100  8    institutions only if they are segregated.
A22 0110  3       "Emory could not continue to operate according to
A22 0120  2    its present standards as an institution of higher learning,
A22 0120 11    of true university grade, and meet its financial obligations,
A22 0130  9    without the tax-exemption privileges which are available
A22 0140  7    to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned
A22 0150  5    constitutional and statutory provisions", the statement
A22 0160  3    said.
A22 0160  4       The statement did not mention what steps might be
A22 0170  3    taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.
A22 0180  1       An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the
A22 0180  8    university itself did not intend to make any test of
A22 0190  9    the laws.
A22 0190 11       The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the
A22 0200  6    power to exempt colleges from property taxation if,
A22 0210  4    among other criteria, "all endowments to institutions
A22 0220  1    established for white people shall be limited to white
A22 0220 10    people, and all endowments to institutions established
A22 0230  7    for colored people shall be limited to colored people".
A22 0240  6       At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area
A22 0250  5    now or in the past have had integrated student bodies,
A22 0260  2    but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged
A22 0260 11    by the state.
A22 0270  2       Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church. Some
A22 0280  1    church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized
A22 0280  9    the university for not taking the lead in desegregation.
A22 0290  1    #URGED IN 1954#
A22 0290  4    The student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as
A22 0300  8    the fall of 1954 called for desegregation.
A22 0310  3       "From its beginning", the trustees' statement said
A22 0320  3    Friday, "Emory University has assumed as its primary
A22 0330  1    commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian
A22 0330  8    higher learning. Teaching, research and study, according
A22 0340  6    to highest standards, under Christian influence, are
A22 0350  4    paramount in the Emory University policy.
A22 0360  1       "As a private institution, supported by generous
A22 0360  8    individuals, Emory University will recognize no obligation
A22 0370  7    and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its
A22 0380  7    purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian
A22 0390  4    education.
A22 0390  5       "There is not now, nor has there ever been in Emory
A22 0400  7    University's charter or by-laws any requirement that
A22 0410  3    students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race,
A22 0420  1    color or creed. Insofar as its own governing documents
A22 0420 10    are concerned, Emory University could now consider
A22 0430  6    applications from prospective students, and others
A22 0440  1    seeking applications from prospective students, and
A22 0450  2    others seeking the opportunity to study or work at
A22 0450 11    the university, irrespective of race, color or creed.
A22 0460  7    #CORPORATE EXISTENCE#
A22 0460  9    "On the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate
A22 0470  9    existence from the State of Georgia. ...
A22 0480  6       "When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional
A22 0490  3    and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to
A22 0500  3    the maintenance of its educational program and facilities,
A22 0510  1    Emory University will consider applications of persons
A22 0510  8    desiring to study or work at the University without
A22 0520  9    regard to race, color or creed, continuing university
A22 0530  4    policy that all applications shall be considered on
A22 0540  2    the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other
A22 0540 11    criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective
A22 0550  8    conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its
A22 0560  6    mission as an institution of Christian higher education".
A22 0580  1       A young man was killed and two others injured at
A22 0580 11    midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid
A22 0590  8    into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street,
A22 0600  4    NE, police said.
A22 0600  7       The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims,
A22 0610  7    19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir., SE.
A22 0620  2       Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid
A22 0630  2    out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into
A22 0630 12    the pole.
A22 0640  2       The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18,
A22 0640 10    of 963 Ponce de Leon Ave., NE, and Larry Coleman Barnett,
A22 0650 11    19, of 704 Hill St., SE, both of whom were treated
A22 0660 11    at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises.
A22 0680  1       The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands
A22 0680  9    for movie theater integration Friday and threatened
A22 0690  6    picketing and "stand-ins" if negotiations failed.
A22 0700  4       The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners
A22 0710  5    of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for
A22 0720  2    Human Rights.
A22 0720  4    #'INTEND TO ATTEND'#
A22 0720  7    "We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the
A22 0730  7    first of the year", the identically worded letters
A22 0740  3    said.
A22 0740  4       The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start
A22 0750  4    of negotiations. They indicated that stand-ins and
A22 0760  1    picketing would be started if theater owners failed
A22 0760  9    to cooperate.
A22 0770  1       Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted
A22 0770  9    Friday night for comment on the COAHR request, said
A22 0780  9    they had no knowledge of such a letter, and that it
A22 0790  8    was not in the Friday mail. However, three of the managers
A22 0800  5    did say that they would agree to attend the proposed
A22 0810  2    meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend.
A22 0810 12    #GATHER HERE#
A22 0820  2    The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering
A22 0830  1    of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here
A22 0830 10    Sunday. Several theater operators said, however, that
A22 0840  7    there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed
A22 0850  6    during the three-day affair.
A22 0860  1       Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate
A22 0860  8    theater integration several months ago. Charles A.
A22 0870  6    Black, COAHR chairman, said Friday that three theater
A22 0880  6    representatives had agreed to meet with the students
A22 0890  4    on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up. He declined to
A22 0900  2    name the three.
A22 0900  5       Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting. Failure
A22 0910  3    to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend,
A22 0920  1    the letters said, would be considered a "sign of indifference".
A22 0930  1       Black said COAHR "hoped to be able to integrate
A22 0930 10    the theaters without taking direct action, but we are
A22 0940  9    pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at
A22 0950  6    our disposal ..."
A22 0950  9       A prepared statement released by the student group
A22 0970  7    Friday stated that "extensive research by COAHR into
A22 0980  5    techniques and methods of theater integration in other
A22 0990  4    cities indicated that the presence of picket lines
A22 0995  1    and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop
A22 1000  7    in profits ..."
A22 1010  1       Besides managers of downtown theaters, the students
A22 1010  8    sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown
A22 1020 10    area and Buckhead.
A22 1030  1    #R. E. KILLINGSWORTH#
A22 1030  4    Raymond E. Killingsworth, 72, died Sunday at his home
A22 1040  5    at 357 Venable St., NW.
A22 1040 10       Mr. Kililngsworth was a foreman with S and W Cafeteria.
A22 1050  9    He was born in Pittsboro, Miss., and was a veteran
A22 1060  8    of World War I. He was a member of the Baptist church.
A22 1070  8       Survivors include two brothers, C. E. Killingsworth,
A22 1080  4    Atlanta, and John Killingsworth, Warren, Ohio; and
A22 1090  4    two sisters, Miss Minnie Kililngsworth and Mrs. Bessie
A22 1100  3    Bloom, both of Gettysburg, Pa.
A22 1100  8    #JOHN W. BALL#
A22 1110  1    John William Ball, 68, of 133 Marietta St. NW, Apartment
A22 1120  1    101B, died Sunday at his home.
A22 1120  7       Mr. Ball was a house painter. He was a member of
A22 1130  7    the Oakland City Methodist Church and a native of Atlanta.
A22 1140  6       Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Blanchard's
A22 1150  4    Chapel with the Rev. J. H. Hearn officiating.
A22 1160  2       Survivors include his sister, Mrs. Emma B. Odom
A22 1170  3    of Atlanta.
A22 1170  5    #MRS. LOLA HARRIS#
A22 1170  8    Mrs. Lola M. Harris, a native of Atlanta, died Sunday
A22 1180  8    at her home in Garland, Tex.
A22 1190  2       Survivors include a son, Charles R. Fergeson, Memphis,
A22 1200  1    Tenn.; two daughters, Mrs. Gene F. Stoll and Miss Nancy
A22 1210  2    Harris, both of Garland; her father, H. T. Simpson,
A22 1220  1    Greenville, S.C., and three sisters, Mrs. W. E. Little
A22 1230  1    and Mrs. Hal B. Wansley, both of Atlanta, and Mrs.
A22 1230 11    Bill Wallace, Wilmington, N.C.
A22 1250  1       A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after
A22 1250 11    breaking into the home of relatives in search of his
A22 1260 10    wife, hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting
A22 1270  5    two police officers who tried to subdue him, police
A22 1280  2    said.
A22 1280  3       Patrolmen J. W. Slate and A. L. Crawford Jr. said
A22 1290  3    they arrested Ronald M. Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma St.,
A22 1300  2    NW, after he assaulted the officers.
A22 1300  8    #POLICE ACCOUNT#
A22 1310  1    The officers gave this account:
A22 1310  6       Thomas early Sunday went to the home of his uncle
A22 1320  7    and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Thomas, 511 Blanche St.,
A22 1330  4    NW, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou Thomas, 18,
A22 1340  3    and their 11-month-old baby.
A22 1340  9       The younger Thomas ripped a screen door, breaking
A22 1350  6    the latch, and after an argument struck his uncle with
A22 1360  4    a rock, scratching his face. He also struck his aunt
A22 1370  1    and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered
A22 1370 11    scratches.
A22 1380  1       When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate
A22 1380 10    said.
A22 1380 11    #ATTACKS OFFICER#
A22 1390  2    He attacked one of the officers and was restrained.
A22 1400  1    About five minutes later he jumped up, Slate said,
A22 1400 10    and struck the two policemen again.
A22 1410  4       He was then subdued and placed in the police car
A22 1420  2    to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches
A22 1420 12    received in the melee. Then he attacked the two officers
A22 1430 10    again and was again restrained, Slate related.
A22 1440  4       Slate said he and Crawford received cuts and scratches
A22 1450  4    and their uniforms were badly torn.
A22 1460  1       Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and
A22 1460 10    battery. Two counts of assault on an officer, resisting
A22 1470  7    arrest, disturbance and cursing, police said. A hearing
A22 1480  5    was set for 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.
A22 1490  1       Mrs. Mary Self, who knows more than any other person
A22 1490 11    about the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept
A22 1500 10    personnel records over the years, has closed her desk
A22 1510  7    and retired.
A22 1510  9       Over the weekend, Mrs. Self, personnel clerk, was
A22 1520  6    a feted and honored guest of the Atlanta Club, organization
A22 1530  4    of women employes at City Hall.
A22 1540  1       After 18 years in the personnel office, she has
A22 1540 10    taken a disability pension on advice of her doctors.
A22 1550  6       As personnel clerk, she handled thousands of entries,
A22 1560  4    ranging from appointments to jobs, to transfers to
A22 1570  2    other employments, to pensions.
A22 1570  6       "I have enjoyed it and will feel a bit lost at least
A22 1580  8    for a while", she said wistfully Friday.
A22 1590  1       One of the largest crowds in the club's history
A22 1590 10    turned out to pay tribute to Mrs. Self and her service.
A22 1610  1       Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying
A22 1610  7    its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay
A22 1620  9    ahead of the fast-spreading pest.
A22 1630  2       The department is planning to expand its eradication
A22 1640  1    program soon to four additional counties- Troup, Pierce,
A22 1640  9    Bryan and Bulloch- to treat 132,000 acres infested
A22 1650  8    by the ants, according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist.
A22 1660  7       Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical,
A22 1670  7    heptachlor, over 30,000 acres in Troup, 37,000 acres
A22 1680  5    in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties.
A22 1700  1       The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and
A22 1710  2    Jones counties, over 37,679 acres. The department has
A22 1710 10    just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas
A22 1720  7    of Macon.
A22 1720  9       Also being treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift,
A22 1730  6    Turner and Dodge counties, Blasingame said. The fire
A22 1740  5    ant is thought to infest approximately two million
A22 1750  3    acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife
A22 1760  1    and livestock and can be a serious health menace to
A22 1760 11    humans who are allergic to its venom, Blasingame said.
A22 1780  1       The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th
A22 1780 10    Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic
A22 1790  8    hours this week.
A22 1800  1       This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete
A22 1800 10    the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway.
A22 1810  9    Students have been using electric computers and high
A22 1820  6    speed movie cameras during the study. Perhaps the engineers
A22 1830  4    can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest
A22 1840  2    methods to eliminate it.
A22 1840  6       Incidentally, 14th Street and the Expressway is
A22 1850  5    the high accident intersection during daylight hours.
A22 1860  2    It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue,
A22 1860 11    NE; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways
A22 1870  9    and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street, NW.
A22 1890  1       Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes,
A22 1890  9    two of them in a fiery crash near Snellville, the State
A22 1910  9    Patrol said Sunday.
A22 1920  1       The latest death reported was that of 4-year-old
A22 1920 11    Claude Douglas Maynor of Calvary. Troopers said the
A22 1930  7    child ran into the path of a passing car a half-mile
A22 1940  8    north of Calvary on Georgia 111 in Grady County.
A22 1950  2       That death occurred at 6:50 p.m. Friday and was
A22 1960  2    reported Sunday, the patrol said.
A22 1960  7    #BURSTS INTO FLAMES#
A22 1960 10    An auto overturned, skidding into a stopped tractor-trailer
A22 1970  9    and burst into flames near Snellville, the patrol said.
A22 1980  7       Bobby Bester Hammett, 21, of Rte. 3, Lawrenceville,
A22 1990  6    and Mrs. Lucille Herrington Jones, 23, of Lawrenceville,
A22 2000  5    died in the flaming car, the patrol said.
