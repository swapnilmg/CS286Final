B21 0010  1    All false gods resemble Moloch, at least in the early
B21 0010 11    phases of their careers, so it would be unreasonable
B21 0020  7    to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread
B21 0030  4    without the accompaniment of human sacrifice. But there
B21 0040  3    is reason in all things, and in this country the heathenish
B21 0050  1    cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its
B21 0050 12    demands. The annual butchery of 40,000 American men,
B21 0060  6    women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive;
B21 0070  6    a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient.
B21 0080  3       No other popular idol is accorded even that much
B21 0090  1    grace. If the railroads, for example, regularly slaughtered
B21 0090  9    25,000 passengers each year, the high priests of the
B21 0100  9    cult would have cause to tremble for their personal
B21 0110  6    safety, for such a holocaust would excite demands for
B21 0120  3    the hanging of every railroad president in the United
B21 0120 12    States. But by comparison with the railroad, the motor
B21 0130  9    car is a relatively new object of popular worship,
B21 0140  6    so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within
B21 0150  5    the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.
B21 0160  1       Yet it is plainly time to make a start, and to be
B21 0160 13    effective the first move should be highly dramatic,
B21 0170  8    without being fanatical. Here, then, is what Swift
B21 0180  5    would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning.
B21 0190  3    From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account
B21 0200  1    of each successive fatality on the highways, publicizing
B21 0200  9    it on all media of communication. To avoid suspicion
B21 0210  7    of bigotry, let the hand of vengeance be stayed until
B21 0220  6    the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth
B21 0230  2    corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first
B21 0230 11    butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state
B21 0240 11    highway commissioners.
B21 0250  1       Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass
B21 0250 12    execution on July 4, 1963. The scene, of course, should
B21 0260 10    be nine miles northwest of Centralia, Illinois, the
B21 0270  5    geographical center of population according to the
B21 0280  3    census. A special grandstand, protected by awnings
B21 0280 10    from the midsummer sun of Illinois, should be erected
B21 0290  9    for occupancy by honored guests, who should include
B21 0300  6    the ambassadors of all those new African nations as
B21 0310  3    yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly
B21 0320  2    civilized. The band should play the Rogues' March as
B21 0320 11    a processional, switching to "Hail Columbia, Happy
B21 0330  7    Land"! as the trap is sprung.
B21 0340  5       Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical
B21 0350  4    reminder of the American article of faith that governments
B21 0360  1    are instituted among men to secure to them certain
B21 0360 10    inalienable rights, the first of which is life, and
B21 0370  9    when any government becomes subversive of that end,
B21 0380  4    it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.
B21 0390  2    The highway system is an agency of government, and
B21 0390 11    when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government
B21 0400  8    is destroying its own taxpayers, which is obviously
B21 0410  5    a silly thing for any government to do.
B21 0420  1       Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish
B21 0420  8    the government, but would emphasize its accountability
B21 0430  6    for the lives of its individual citizens, which would
B21 0440  4    certainly alter it, and definitely for the better.
B21 0450  3    Moreover, the salubrious effects would not be exclusively
B21 0460  1    political, but at least partially, and perhaps primarily
B21 0460  9    social. It would challenge sharply not the cult of
B21 0470  8    the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs
B21 0480  5    and practices- for instance, the doctrine that the
B21 0490  3    fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither
B21 0490 11    to yon, not for any advantage to be gained by arrival
B21 0500 10    but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis, or,
B21 0510  6    as it is generally termed, staying put.
B21 0520  1       True, the adherents of staying put are now reduced
B21 0520 10    to a minor, even a miniscule sect, and their credo,
B21 0530  8    "Home-keeping hearts are happiest", is as disreputable
B21 0540  5    as Socinianism. Nonetheless, although few in number
B21 0550  4    they are a stubborn crew, as tenacious of life as the
B21 0560  1    Hardshell Baptists, which suggests that there is some
B21 0560  9    kind of vital principle embodied in their faith. Perhaps
B21 0570  7    there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the
B21 0580  7    conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia, Robert Ruark's
B21 0590  3    grandfather, who was persuaded that the great curse
B21 0600  1    of the modern world is "all this gallivantin'".
B21 0600  9       In any event, the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims
B21 0610  8    is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most
B21 0620  7    ardent faith. Somehow our contemporary Moloch must
B21 0630  2    be induced to see reason. Since appeals to morality,
B21 0630 11    to humanity, and to sanity have had such small effect,
B21 0640  9    perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example.
B21 0650  5    If we make it established custom that whenever butchery
B21 0660  3    on the highways grows excessive, say beyond 25,000
B21 0670  1    per annum, then somebody is going to hang, it follows
B21 0670 11    that the more eminent the victim, the more impressive
B21 0680  8    the lesson. To hang 50 Governors might be preferable
B21 0690  5    except that they are not directly related to the highways;
B21 0700  4    so, all things considered, the highway commissioners
B21 0710  1    would seem to be elected. As the new clouds of radioactive
B21 0720  7    fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth,
B21 0730  4    the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime
B21 0740  1    against the human race. But the guilt is shared by
B21 0740 11    the United States, Britain and France, the other members
B21 0750  7    of the atomic club. Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing
B21 0760  5    last September 1, the US and UK had released more
B21 0770  5    than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as
B21 0780  2    the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts
B21 0780 11    is still coming down. As it descends, the concentration
B21 0790  8    of radioactivity builds up in the human body; for a
B21 0800  8    dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes
B21 0810  4    temporary discomfort and then dies. The effect of radiation
B21 0820  2    is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding
B21 0820 11    generations. So, while we properly inveigh against
B21 0830  7    the new poisoning, history is not likely to justify
B21 0840  6    the pose of righteousness which some in the West were
B21 0850  3    so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical
B21 0860  1    and irresponsible threat. Shock, dismay and foreboding
B21 0860  8    for future generations were legitimate reactions; a
B21 0870  6    holier-than-thou sermon was not.
B21 0880  2       On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at
B21 0880 11    least 20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned
B21 0890  7    the UN General Assembly that this country, in "self
B21 0900  7    protection", might have to resume above-ground tests.
B21 0910  6    More recently, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission,
B21 0920  3    Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, "admitted" to a news conference
B21 0930  5    in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the US might fall behind
B21 0940  3    Russia (he apparently meant in weapons development)
B21 0940 10    if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while
B21 0950  9    we abstain. The trial balloons are afloat.
B21 0960  5       All of which makes it more imperative than ever
B21 0970  3    that the biological and genetic effects of fallout
B21 0970 11    be understood. But for the average citizen, unfortunately,
B21 0980  7    this is one of science's worst-marked channels, full
B21 0990  5    of tricky currents and unknown depths. The scientists,
B21 1000  4    in and out of government, do not agree on some of the
B21 1010  3    most vital points, at least publicly. On the one hand,
B21 1010 13    the Public Health Service declared as recently as October
B21 1020  8    26 that present radiation levels resulting from the
B21 1030  6    Soviet shots "do not warrant undue public concern"
B21 1040  4    or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances
B21 1050  2    by individuals or large population groups anywhere
B21 1050  9    in the US. But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive
B21 1060 10    particles "will add to the risk of genetic effects
B21 1070  9    in succeeding generations, and possibly to the risk
B21 1080  6    of health damage to some people in the United States".
B21 1090  2    Then it added: "It is not possible to determine how
B21 1100  2    extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people
B21 1100 12    will be affected".
B21 1110  3       Having hedged its bets in this way, PHS apparently
B21 1120  2    decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination
B21 1130  1    after all: "At present radiation levels, and even at
B21 1130 10    somewhat higher levels, the additional risk is slight
B21 1140  8    and very few people will be affected". Then, to conclude
B21 1150  6    on an indeterminate note: "Nevertheless, if fallout
B21 1160  3    increased substantially, or remained high for a long
B21 1170  3    time, it would become far more important as a potential
B21 1170 13    health hazard in this country and throughout the world".
B21 1180  9       Dr. Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry,
B21 1190  8    has been less ambiguous, whether you choose to agree
B21 1200  6    with him or not. After declaring, in an article last
B21 1210  4    month in Frontier magazine, that the Russian testing
B21 1220  1    "carries with it the possibility of the most tragic
B21 1220 10    consequences of any action in the history of the world",
B21 1230 10    he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences
B21 1240  7    if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons:
B21 1250  3       The damage to human germ plasm would be such that
B21 1260  3    in the next few generations 160,000 children around
B21 1260 11    the world would be born with gross physical or mental
B21 1270  9    defects. Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process
B21 1280  5    would cause four million embryonic, neonatal or childhood
B21 1290  3    deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations,
B21 1300  1    and between 200,000 and one million human beings now
B21 1300 10    living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced
B21 1310  8    diseases such as leukemia. Most of these would be in
B21 1320  7    the Northern Hemisphere, where the fallout is concentrating.
B21 1330  3    Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present
B21 1340  3    series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be
B21 1350  1    too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct
B21 1350 12    possibility.
B21 1360  1       The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects
B21 1360  9    of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering
B21 1370  7    large population groups, from which agreed-on generalizations
B21 1380  5    could be drawn. But more than one conscientious researcher
B21 1390  2    has been inhibited from completely frank discussion
B21 1400  1    of the available evidence by the less excusable fact
B21 1400 10    that fallout has been made a political issue as well
B21 1410  9    as a scientific problem. Its dangerous effects have
B21 1420  4    been downgraded to the public by some who believe national
B21 1430  2    security requires further testing. An illustration
B21 1430  8    of this attitude is found in John A. McCone's letter
B21 1440  9    to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere
B21 1450  7    in this issue of The New Republic.
B21 1460  2       To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away
B21 1470  2    from discussing the health aspects of fallout. A recent
B21 1470 11    study on radiation exposure by the AEC's division
B21 1480  8    of biology and medicine stated: "The question of the
B21 1490  7    biological effect ... of [radiation] doses is not considered"
B21 1500  5    herein. Of course, the AEC is in a bind now. If it
B21 1510  8    comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout,
B21 1520  3    it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.
B21 1530  1    So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet
B21 1530  9    shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences,
B21 1540  9    with the fission yield usually left vague.
B21 1550  3       Now, of course, that the Russians are the nuclear
B21 1560  2    villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in
B21 1560 12    the mid-1950s, when the US was testing in the atmosphere.
B21 1570  9    The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be
B21 1580  7    that fallout, if not exactly good for you, might not
B21 1590  5    be much worse than a bad cold. After a nuclear blast,
B21 1600  1    one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about
B21 1600  9    all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep
B21 1610 10    off your sidewalks and roof. Things aren't that simple
B21 1620  4    anymore. Yet if Washington gets too indignant about
B21 1630  2    Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork
B21 1640  1    if America decides it too must start pushing up the
B21 1640 11    radiation count.
B21 1650  1    #HOW MUCH FALLOUT WILL WE GET?#
B21 1650  7    As of October 25, the AEC had reported 24 shots in
B21 1660  6    the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton range,
B21 1670  2    including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons
B21 1680  1    (the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of
B21 1680 11    TNT); and President Kennedy indicated there were one
B21 1700  7    or two more than those reported.
B21 1710  1       Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and
B21 1710 10    one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons,
B21 1720  8    a conservative computation is that the 24 announced
B21 1730  6    tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons.
B21 1740  2    Some government scientists say privately that the figure
B21 1750  1    probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full
B21 1750 11    50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still
B21 1760  6    be detonated.
B21 1760  8       If the new Soviet series has followed the general
B21 1770  7    pattern of previous Russian tests, the shots were roughly
B21 1780  6    half fission and half fusion, meaning a fission yield
B21 1790  3    of 30 to 40 megatons thus far. To this must be added
B21 1790 15    the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between
B21 1800 10    the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal
B21 1810  8    three-power test moratorium that began in November,
B21 1820  4    1958.
