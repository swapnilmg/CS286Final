L01 0010  1       There were thirty-eight patients on the bus the
L01 0010 10    morning I left for Hanover, most of them disturbed
L01 0020  7    and hallucinating. An interne, a nurse and two attendants
L01 0030  6    were in charge of us.
L01 0030 11       I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the
L01 0040  8    bus window at Chicago's grim, dirty West Side. It seemed
L01 0050  6    incredible, as I listened to the monotonous drone of
L01 0060  3    voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the
L01 0060 12    patients, that technically I was a ward of the state
L01 0070 10    of Illinois, going to a hospital for the mentally ill.
L01 0080  7       I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan, the way
L01 0090  5    her pretty eyes could flash with anger, her quiet competence,
L01 0100  2    the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath
L01 0100 10    the surface of her defenses.
L01 0110  5       We had become good friends during my stay at Cook
L01 0120  4    County Hospital. I had told her enough about myself
L01 0130  1    to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared
L01 0130 10    in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall
L01 0140  7    Field + Co. She knew that I lived at a good address
L01 0150  9    on the Gold Coast, that I had once been a medical student
L01 0160  6    and was thinking of returning to the university to
L01 0170  2    finish my medical studies. She knew also that I was
L01 0170 12    unmarried and without a single known relative. She
L01 0180  8    wasn't quite sure that I felt enough remorse about
L01 0190  6    my drinking, or that I would not return to it once
L01 0200  4    I was out and on my own again. This had worried her.
L01 0210  1       "I read those newspaper stories about you", she
L01 0210  9    had said. "You must have loved that girl very much,
L01 0220  8    but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you
L01 0230  7    wanted to kill her".
L01 0230 11       "Why do you say that"? I asked. "I was full of booze
L01 0240 10    and, well, a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll
L01 0250  9    do".
L01 0250 10       Nonsense! I grew up in an Irish neighborhood on
L01 0260  7    Chicago's West Side. Don't tell me about drunks. You're
L01 0270  6    not the kind to go violent. Were you in love with that
L01 0280  5    girl"?
L01 0280  6       "Would it make any difference to you if I were,
L01 0290  5    Mary Jane"?
L01 0290  7       She met my eyes, suddenly angry. "I wouldn't have
L01 0300  5    gone into nursing if I didn't care about people. I'm
L01 0310  3    interested in every patient I've helped take care of.
L01 0320  2    When I think of people like you, well, I"-
L01 0320 11       "You what, Mary Jane"?
L01 0330  4       "You are young, intelligent, have a whole lifetime
L01 0340  3    before you to make something worth while of yourself,
L01 0340 12    but you mess it up with whiskey, indifference, self-destructive
L01 0350 10    attitudes. I don't blame that girl for breaking her
L01 0360  9    engagement with you. Was she pretty"?
L01 0370  3       "Oh, yes", I said, feeling annoyed, "she was very
L01 0380  4    pretty. You don't believe that I'm going back to medical
L01 0390  2    school and finish, do you"?
L01 0390  7       "Why should I? I've worked this ward for three months
L01 0400  7    now. We keep getting the same ones back again and again.
L01 0410  6    They all mean well, have great promises to make when
L01 0420  3    they are about to go home, but drinking is their sickness.
L01 0430  1    You've not seemed like them, but maybe you are. You've
L01 0430 11    treated your stay here like a big joke. It's not a
L01 0440 11    joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover.
L01 0450  6    I wanted to go to college, to"-
L01 0460  1       "Why didn't you"? I asked. "Chicago has some of
L01 0460 10    the best"-
L01 0470  3       Her eyes flashed angrily. "That's what I mean about
L01 0480  1    you, Anderson", she said. "You don't seem to know much
L01 0480 11    about reality. I'll tell you why I didn't go to college;
L01 0490 11    I'm the oldest of six children. My father's a policeman
L01 0500 10    and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year.
L01 0510  7    There was no money for tuition, for clothes, for all
L01 0520  5    the things you apparently take for granted. Nurses'
L01 0530  1    training here doesn't cost anything. They even pay
L01 0530  9    me six dollars a month. I think it's a good deal. I'm
L01 0540 10    going to become a good nurse, and I've got two baby
L01 0550  7    brothers that are going to have college if I have to
L01 0560  5    work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give
L01 0570  1    it to them".
L01 0570  4       "Do you have a boy friend"? I asked.
L01 0580  1       "That's none of your business", she said, then changed
L01 0590  1    the subject. "What about your father and mother, don't
L01 0590 10    you think of them when you're in a place like this"?
L01 0600 10       "My father and mother died when I was two years
L01 0610  9    old", I said. "My aunt raised me. Aunt Mary died when
L01 0620  6    I was doing my military service. I have no one but
L01 0630  4    myself to worry about".
L01 0630  8       Something in my voice must have touched her deeply
L01 0640  5    because her anger passed quickly, and she turned away
L01 0650  3    to keep me from seeing her face.
L01 0650 10       "I'm sorry", she said. "I don't know what I'd do
L01 0660  9    without my family. We've always been so close".
L01 0670  5       "Tell me more about them".
L01 0671  1       Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father
L01 0680 10    and mother, aunts and uncles, cousins. Listening, I
L01 0690  6    felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can. When
L01 0700  4    she had finished I said:
L01 0700  9       "Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman.
L01 0710  9    I'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me
L01 0720  8    were to ask his daughter for a date- I mean, after
L01 0730  6    I'm out of the hospital, a month or so from now".
L01 0740  1       "My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been
L01 0740 11    attached to Homicide for five years. He's a pretty
L01 0750  9    good judge of character, Anderson. I don't think he'd
L01 0760  6    mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to
L01 0770  4    be a rumdum in the future".
L01 0770 10       "What about you? How would you feel about it if
L01 0780  9    I were to ask you for a date when I get through at
L01 0790  6    Hanover"?
L01 0790  7       "If I thought you were serious about going back
L01 0800  6    to school, that you'd learned something from your experiences
L01 0810  4    here and at Hanover- well, I might consider such an
L01 0820  3    offer. What about your ... that girl you were going
L01 0820 13    to kill"?
L01 0830  1       It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary
L01 0830 10    Jane Brennan should know the truth about me- that I
L01 0840 10    was not the confused, sick, irresponsible person she
L01 0850  5    believed me to be.
L01 0850  9       "There are things about me that I can't tell you
L01 0860 10    now, Mary Jane", I said, "but if you'll go out to dinner
L01 0880  9    with me when I get out of Hanover, I'd like to tell
L01 0890  5    you the whole story. I can say this: I'm dead serious
L01 0900  3    about going back to school. As for that other girl,
L01 0910  1    let's just say that I never want to see her again.
L01 0910 12    You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover,
L01 0920  9    won't you"?
L01 0930  1       "Yes, I'll get one overnight a month".
L01 0930  8       "We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner",
L01 0940  8    I said. "Do you like to dance? They always have a good
L01 0950  8    orchestra".
L01 0950  9       "I like to dance", she said, then turned and walked
L01 0960  9    away.
L01 0960 10       There hadn't been anything really personal in her
L01 0970  7    interest in me. I knew that. It was just that she felt
L01 0980  7    deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to
L01 0990  4    believe that they might benefit from their treatment
L01 0990 12    there.
L01 1000  1       Now, riding this hospital bus, feeling isolated
L01 1000  8    and utterly alone, I knew that she was genuine and
L01 1010  9    unique, quite unlike any girl I had known before. It
L01 1020  6    seemed the most important thing in my life at this
L01 1030  3    moment that she should know the real truth about me.
L01 1040  1       It was a fantastic story. Only two people in the
L01 1040 10    state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover
L01 1050  6    State Hospital under an assumed name, or why. It was
L01 1060  5    unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan
L01 1070  1    would believe it without proof. But I had the proof,
L01 1070 11    all documented in a legal agreement which I would show
L01 1080  9    her the moment I was free to do so.
L01 1090  4       As the bus turned into the main highway and headed
L01 1100  1    toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed
L01 1100 11    my eyes, thinking over the events of the past two weeks,
L01 1110  9    trying to put the pieces in order. I wondered suddenly
L01 1120  5    as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming
L01 1130  2    from the patient behind me, if I had not perhaps imagined
L01 1140  1    it all. Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson, the
L01 1140 11    actor, was delusion; a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination.
L01 1150  8    #FOUR#
L01 1150  9    I had come to Chicago from New York early in September
L01 1160 11    with a dramatic production called Ask Tony. It was
L01 1170  7    a bad play, real grade-A turkey, which only a prevalence
L01 1180  6    of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and
L01 1190  4    tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal. No
L01 1200  1    one, not even the producer, had any real hope of getting
L01 1200 12    it back to Broadway. But because it was a suspense
L01 1210  7    gangster story of the Capone era, many of us felt that
L01 1220  7    it might catch on for a run in Chicago, continue as
L01 1230  2    a road company, and eventually become a movie.
L01 1230 10       Such optimism was completely unjustified. The critics
L01 1240  6    literally screamed their indignation. Ask Tony was
L01 1250  5    doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on it in his
L01 1260  5    Sun-Times column. We opened on Friday and closed the
L01 1270  3    following Monday. Out of the entire cast I alone received
L01 1280  1    good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer.
L01 1280 10    This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of
L01 1290 11    the company, two members of which were native Chicagoans.
L01 1300  5       We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets
L01 1310  4    back to New York.
L01 1310  8       I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags
L01 1320  6    at the Croydon Hotel. It seemed to me that my life
L01 1330  3    was destined to be one brilliant failure after another.
L01 1330 12    I had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U.,
L01 1340 12    had wanted desperately to go to medical school, but
L01 1350  8    I'd run out of money and energy at the same time. Then
L01 1360  7    later I had quit my safe, secure five-a-week spot on
L01 1370  3    a network soap opera to take a part in this play. It
L01 1380  1    seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite
L01 1380 12    stupid as well. I knew that I'd soon be back working
L01 1390  8    as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at
L01 1400  6    Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting
L01 1410  2    job to open. It suddenly occurred to me that I did
L01 1410 13    not particularly like acting, that I was at some sort
L01 1420  9    of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I
L01 1430  7    was going to do with my life.
L01 1440  1       I closed the last bag and stood all three at the
L01 1440 11    door for the bellboy to pick up, then went to the bathroom
L01 1450  9    for a drink of water. The telephone rang. When I answered
L01 1460  5    it a voice too dignified and British to be real said,
L01 1470  4    "Is this Mr. Dale Nelson, the actor"?
L01 1480  1       "All right", I said. "Why don't you bastards lay
L01 1480  9    off for a while"?
L01 1490  2       "I beg your pardon, sir"?
L01 1490  7       "All right. This is Dale Nelson ... the actor".
L01 1500  8       "Good. I'm calling you, Mr. Nelson, at the request
L01 1510  8    of Mr. Phillip Wycoff. Could you possibly have lunch
L01 1520  6    with him today? His car could pick you up at your hotel
L01 1530  6    at twelve".
L01 1530  8       I smiled. "You'll send the Rolls-Royce, of course"?
L01 1540  6       "Yes, of course, Mr. Nelson".
L01 1550  2       I started to say something else appropriate, but
L01 1560  1    the man had hung up.
L01 1560  6       I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main
L01 1570  3    lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows
L01 1570 13    over the untimely passing of Ask Tony. They all bowed
L01 1580 10    low as I approached them.
L01 1590  2       "All right, you bastards", I said, "the great actor
L01 1600  2    is about to buy a drink".
L01 1600  8       I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the
L01 1610  6    bartender to serve a round. He had just returned my
L01 1620  2    change when the doorman came in off the street to page
L01 1620 13    me. I walked over to him.
L01 1630  5       "You Mr. Nelson"? he asked.
L01 1640  1       "That's right".
L01 1640  3       "Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east
L01 1650  6    entrance".
L01 1650  7       I followed him out through the lobby to the street.
L01 1660  5       An ancient Rolls-Royce, as shiningly impressive
L01 1670  2    as the day it came off the ship, was parked at the
L01 1670 14    curb. The elderly chauffeur, immaculate in a dark uniform,
L01 1680  8    stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of
L01 1690  6    the town car.
