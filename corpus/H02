H02 0010  1       In most of the less developed countries, however,
H02 0010  9    such programing is at best inadequate and at worst
H02 0020  8    nonexistent. Only a very few of the more advanced ones,
H02 0030  5    such as India and Pakistan, have developed systematic
H02 0040  2    techniques of programing.
H02 0040  5       Others have so-called development plans, but some
H02 0050  4    of these are little more than lists of projects collected
H02 0060  2    from various ministries while others are statements
H02 0060  9    of goals without analysis of the actions required to
H02 0070  8    attain them. Only rarely is attention given to accurate
H02 0080  6    progress reports and evaluation.
H02 0090  1    _WE CAN HELP IN THE PLANNING PROCESS_
H02 0090  7       Neither growth nor a development program can be
H02 0100  4    imposed on a country; it must express the nation's
H02 0110  1    own will and goal. Nevertheless, we can administer
H02 0110  9    an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development
H02 0120 10    of responsible programing.
H02 0130  1       First, we can encourage responsibility by establishing
H02 0140  1    as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained
H02 0140 10    scale the definition of objectives and the assessment
H02 0150  7    of costs.
H02 0150  9       Second, we can make assistance for particular projects
H02 0160  8    conditional on the consistency of such projects with
H02 0170  7    the program.
H02 0170  9       Third, we can offer technical help in the formulation
H02 0180  9    of programs for development which are adapted to the
H02 0190  6    country's objectives and resources. This includes assistance
H02 0200  3    in- ... assembling the basic economic, financial, technological,
H02 0210  2    and educational information on which programing depends;
H02 0220  1    ... surveying the needs and requirements over time
H02 0220  9    of broad sectors of the economy, such as transport,
H02 0230  8    agriculture, communication, industry, and power; ...
H02 0240  5    designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in
H02 0250  3    ways that will promote growth without inflation; and
H02 0250 11    ... administrative practices which will make possible
H02 0260  7    the more effective review and implementation of programs
H02 0270  6    once established.
H02 0280  1    _WE MUST USE COMMON SENSE IN APPLYING CONDITIONS_
H02 0280  6       The application of conditions in the allocation
H02 0290  1    of aid funds cannot, of course, be mechanical. It must
H02 0300  1    be recognized that countries at different stages of
H02 0300  9    development have very different capabilities of meeting
H02 0310  6    such conditions. To insist on a level of performance
H02 0320  6    in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities
H02 0330  3    of the recipient country would result in the frustration
H02 0340  1    of the basic objective of our development assistance
H02 0340  9    to encourage more rapid growth.
H02 0350  4       In the more primitive areas, where the capacity
H02 0360  1    to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited,
H02 0360  9    some activities may be of such obvious priority that
H02 0370  8    we may decide to support them before a well worked
H02 0380  5    out program is available. Thus, we might provide limited
H02 0390  2    assistance in such fields as education, essential transport,
H02 0400  1    communications, and agricultural improvement despite
H02 0400  6    the absence of acceptable country programs. In such
H02 0410  6    a case, however, we would encourage the recipient country
H02 0420  4    to get on with its programing task, supply it with
H02 0430  3    substantial technical assistance in performing that
H02 0430  9    task, and make it plain that an expansion or even a
H02 0440 10    continuation of our assistance to the country's development
H02 0450  5    was conditional upon programing progress being made.
H02 0460  3       At the other end of the spectrum, where the more
H02 0470  2    advanced countries can be relied upon to make well
H02 0470 11    thought through decisions as to project priorities
H02 0480  6    within a consistent program, we should be prepared
H02 0490  3    to depart substantially from detailed project approval
H02 0500  1    as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward
H02 0500 11    long-term support, in cooperation with other developed
H02 0510  6    countries, of the essential foreign exchange requirements
H02 0520  4    of the country's development program.
H02 0530  1    #D. ENCOURAGING SELF-HELP#
H02 0540  1    _1. THE REASONS FOR STRESSING SELF-HELP_
H02 0540  1       A systematic approach to development budgeting and
H02 0540  8    programing is one important kind of self-help. There
H02 0550  9    are many others. It is vitally important that the new
H02 0560  5    U.S. aid program should encourage all of them, since
H02 0570  4    the main thrust for development must come from the
H02 0570 13    less developed countries themselves. External aid can
H02 0580  7    only be marginal, although the margin, as in the case
H02 0590  8    of the Marshall plan, can be decisive. External aid
H02 0600  3    can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help.
H02 0610  1    U.S. aid, therefore, should increasingly be designed
H02 0610  8    to provide incentives for countries to take the steps
H02 0620  9    that only they themselves can take.
H02 0630  3    _AID ADVICE IS NOT INTERFERENCE_
H02 0630  8       In establishing conditions of self-help, it is important
H02 0640  8    that we not expect countries to remake themselves in
H02 0650  5    our image. Open societies can take many forms, and
H02 0660  2    within very broad limits recipients must be free to
H02 0660 11    set their own goals and to devise their own institutions
H02 0670  9    to achieve those goals. On the other hand, it is no
H02 0680  8    interference with sovereignty to point out defects
H02 0690  3    where they exist, such as that a plan calls for factories
H02 0700  1    without power to run them, or for institutions without
H02 0700 10    trained personnel to staff them. Once we have made
H02 0710  8    clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's
H02 0720  4    development potential, we can be blunt in suggesting
H02 0730  1    the technical conditions that must be met for development
H02 0730 10    to occur.
H02 0740  1    _2. THE RANGE OF SELF-HELP_
H02 0740  7       The major areas of self-help are the following:
H02 0760  1    _(A) THE EFFECTIVE MOBILIZING OF RESOURCES._
H02 0760  1       This includes not only development programing, but
H02 0760  8    also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably
H02 0770  7    resources for investment; fiscal and monetary policies
H02 0780  5    designed to prevent serious inflation; and regulatory
H02 0790  3    policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial
H02 0800  1    resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive
H02 0800  9    luxury consumption by a few.
H02 0820  1    _(B) THE REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL SOURCES._
H02 0820  2       This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises,
H02 0830  1    with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports
H02 0830  9    and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage
H02 0840  6    infant industries and spur exports. It also includes
H02 0850  4    providing for the training of nationals to operate
H02 0860  1    projects after they are completed.
H02 0870  1    _(C) TAPPING THE ENERGIES OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION._
H02 0870  4       For both economic and political reasons all segments
H02 0880  3    of the population must be able to share in the growth
H02 0890  1    of a country. Otherwise, development will not lead
H02 0890  9    to longrun stability.
H02 0900  1    _(D) HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT._
H02 0900  5       In many societies, what we regard as corruption,
H02 0910  4    favoritism, and personal influence are so accepted
H02 0920  1    as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so
H02 0920 10    integral a part of routine administrative practice
H02 0940  4    that any attempt to force their elimination will be
H02 0950  3    regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted
H02 0960  1    but unfriendly. Yet an economy cannot get the most
H02 0960 10    out of its resources if dishonesty, corruption, and
H02 0970  5    favoritism are widespread. Moreover, tolerance by us
H02 0980  4    of such practices results in serious waste and diversion
H02 0990  1    of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American
H02 1000  1    sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political
H02 1000 10    interest. Some of the most dramatic successes of communism
H02 1010  8    in winning local support can be traced to the identification-
H02 1020  7    correct or not- of Communist regimes with personal
H02 1030  4    honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption. A
H02 1040  2    requirement of reasonably honest administration may
H02 1040  8    be politically uncomfortable in the short run, but
H02 1050  7    it is politically essential in the long run.
H02 1060  5    _3. U.S. POSITION ON SELF-HELP_
H02 1060 11       The United States can use its aid as an incentive
H02 1070  9    to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained
H02 1080  5    basis, tailored to priority needs, to those countries
H02 1090  1    making serious efforts in self-help.
H02 1090  7       In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid
H02 1100  7    to countries not yet willing to make such efforts.
H02 1110  2       There are other countries where, with skillful diplomacy,
H02 1120  1    we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to
H02 1120 12    those groups in government which would like to press
H02 1130  8    forward with economic and social reform measures to
H02 1140  4    promote growth. Governments are rarely monolithic.
H02 1150  1       But there will be still other countries where, despite
H02 1160  1    the inadequacy of the level of self-help, we shall
H02 1160 11    deem it wise, for political or military reasons, to
H02 1170  5    give substantial economic assistance. Even in these
H02 1180  4    cases we should promote self-help by making it clear
H02 1180 14    that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction
H02 1190  8    and ultimately to termination.
H02 1200  2    #E. ENCOURAGING A LONG-TERM APPROACH#
H02 1210  1    _1. DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES A LONG-TERM APPROACH_
H02 1210  6       The most fundamental concept of the new approach
H02 1220  4    to economic aid is the focusing of our attention, our
H02 1230  1    resources, and our energies on the effort to promote
H02 1230 10    the economic and social development of the less developed
H02 1240  7    countries. This is not a short-run goal. To have any
H02 1260  5    success in this effort, we must ourselves view it as
H02 1270  3    an enterprise stretching over a considerable number
H02 1270 10    of years, and we must encourage the recipients of our
H02 1280  9    aid to view it in the same fashion.
H02 1300  1    _MOST OF OUR AID WILL GO TO THOSE NEARING SELF-SUFFICIENCY_
H02 1300  1       How long it will take to show substantial success
H02 1300 10    in this effort will vary greatly from country to country.
H02 1310  8    In several significant cases, such as India, a decade
H02 1320  6    of concentrated effort can launch these countries into
H02 1330  3    a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic
H02 1340  1    and social progress with little or no government-to-government
H02 1340 11    assistance. These cases in which light is already visible
H02 1350  9    at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over
H02 1360  9    the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital
H02 1370  6    assistance.
H02 1380  1    _GRADUALLY OTHERS WILL MOVE UP TO THE SAME LEVEL_
H02 1380  4       The number of countries thus favorably situated
H02 1380 11    is small, but their peoples constitute over half of
H02 1390  9    the population of the underdeveloped world. Meantime,
H02 1400  4    over the decade of the sixties, we can hope that many
H02 1410  5    other countries will ready themselves for the big push
H02 1420  2    into self-sustaining growth. In still others which
H02 1420 10    are barely on the threshold of the transition into
H02 1430  7    modernity, the decade can bring significant progress
H02 1440  3    in launching the slow process of developing their human
H02 1450  2    resources and their basic services to the point where
H02 1450 11    an expanded range of developmental activities is possible.
H02 1470  1    _AID IS A LONG-TERM PROCESS_
H02 1470  2       The whole program must be conceived of as an effort,
H02 1470 12    stretching over a considerable number of years, to
H02 1480  8    alter the basic social and economic conditions in the
H02 1490  6    less developed world. It must be recognized as a slow-acting
H02 1500  5    tool designed to prevent political and military crises
H02 1510  2    such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba.
H02 1510 11    It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after
H02 1520 10    they have erupted.
H02 1530  1    _2. THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR A LONG-TERM APPROACH_
H02 1540  1       _(A) THE NEED TO BUDGET A PERIOD OF YEARS._
H02 1540  6       Many of the individual projects for which development
H02 1550  3    assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy
H02 1560  1    periods. Dams, river development schemes, transportation
H02 1560  7    networks, educational systems require years to construct.
H02 1570  7    Moreover, on complex projects, design work must be
H02 1580  6    completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed
H02 1590  4    months or even years before construction can commence.
H02 1600  1    Thus, as a development program is being launched, commitments
H02 1600 10    and obligations must be entered into in a given year
H02 1610 10    which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures
H02 1620  6    to be made in that year. The capital expansion programs
H02 1630  4    of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and
H02 1640  2    the same is true of country development programs.
H02 1650  1    _(B) THE NEED TO PLAN INVESTMENT PROGRAMS._
H02 1650  5       More importantly, several of the more advanced of
H02 1660  5    the less developed countries have found through experience
H02 1670  2    that they must plan their own complex investment programs
H02 1670 11    for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably
H02 1680 10    more than that if they are to be sure that the various
H02 1690 11    interdependent activities involved are all to take
H02 1700  6    place in the proper sequence. Without such forward
H02 1710  2    planning, investment funds are wasted because manufacturing
H02 1710  9    facilities are completed before there is power to operate
H02 1720  9    them or before there is transport to service them;
H02 1730  7    or a skilled labor force is trained before there are
H02 1740  4    plants available in which they can be employed.
H02 1750  1    _(C) THE NEED TO ALLOCATE COUNTRY RESOURCES._
H02 1750  8       Most important of all, the less developed countries
H02 1760  7    must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate
H02 1770  4    and commit their own resources. They must be induced
H02 1780  3    to establish the necessary tax, fiscal, monetary, and
H02 1780 11    regulatory policies. They must be persuaded to adopt
H02 1790  8    the other necessary self-help measures which are described
H02 1800  5    in the preceding section. The taking of these steps
H02 1810  4    involves tough internal policy decisions. Moreover,
H02 1820  1    once these steps are taken, they may require years
H02 1820 10    to make themselves felt. They must, therefore, be related
H02 1830  7    to long-range development plans.
H02 1840  2    _3. PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE_
H02 1840  6       If the less developed countries are to be persuaded
H02 1850  5    to adopt a long-term approach, the United States, as
H02 1860  2    the principal supplier of external aid, must be prepared
H02 1860 11    to give long-term commitments. In this, as in so many
H02 1870 10    aspects of our development assistance activities, the
H02 1880  4    incentive effects of the posture we take are the most
H02 1890  4    important ones. The extent to which we can persuade
H02 1900  1    the less developed countries to appraise their own
H02 1900  9    resources, to set targets toward which they should
H02 1910  5    be working, to establish in the light of this forward
H02 1930  1    perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate
H02 1940  1    attention, and to do the other things which they must
H02 1940 11    do to help themselves, all on a realistic long-term
H02 1950  7    basis, will depend importantly on the incentives we
H02 1960  5    place before them. If they feel that we are taking
H02 1970  1    a long-term view of their problems and are prepared
H02 1970 11    to enter into reasonably long-term association with
H02 1980  6    them in their development activities, they will be
H02 1990  4    much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required.
H02 2000  1    Perhaps the most important incentive for them will
H02 2000  9    be clear evidence that where other countries have done
H02 2010  8    this kind of home work we have responded with long-term
H02 2020  6    commitments.
