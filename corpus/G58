G58 0010  1       From New Jersey, Morgan hastened to the headquarters
G58 0010  9    of Washington at Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, arriving
G58 0020  5    there on November 18th. There was much sickness in
G58 0030  6    the corps, and the men were, in addition, without the
G58 0040  3    clothing, shoes, and blankets needed for the winter
G58 0040 11    weather. Morgan himself had sciatica again. Even on
G58 0050  8    his tough constitution, the exposure and strenuous
G58 0060  5    activity were beginning to tell in earnest.
G58 0070  1       On the morning of November 17th, Cornwallis and
G58 0070  9    2,000 men had left Philadelphia with the object of
G58 0080  9    capturing Fort Mercer at Red Bank, New Jersey. In order
G58 0090  8    to prevent this, Washington hastened to dispatch several
G58 0110  4    units to reinforce the fort, including a force under
G58 0120  2    the Marquis de Lafayette containing some 160 of Morgan's
G58 0130  1    riflemen, all who were fit for duty at this time, the
G58 0130 12    rest having no shoes. Although the fort was evacuated
G58 0140  6    in the face of the force of Cornwallis, Morgan and
G58 0150  3    his men did have a chance to take another swing at
G58 0160  2    the redcoats. A picket guard of about 350, mostly Hessians,
G58 0160 12    were attacked by the Americans under Lafayette, and
G58 0170  8    driven back to their camp, some twenty to thirty of
G58 0180  7    them falling before the riflemen's fire.
G58 0190  1       "I never saw men", Lafayette declared in regard
G58 0190  9    to the riflemen, "so merry, so spirited, and so desirous
G58 0200  9    to go on to the enemy, whatever force they might have,
G58 0210  7    as that small party in this fight". Nathanael Greene
G58 0220  3    told Washington that "Lafayette was charmed with the
G58 0230  3    spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen".
G58 0240  1       A few days later it was learned that General Howe
G58 0240 10    was planning an attack upon the American camp. The
G58 0250  7    British general moved his forces north from Philadelphia
G58 0260  4    to Chestnut Hill, near the right wing of the patriot
G58 0270  3    encampment. Here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished
G58 0270  9    with the British, but soon fled. Morgan was ordered
G58 0280  9    to attack the enemy, who had meantime moved to Edge
G58 0290  7    Hill on the left of the Americans. Similar orders were
G58 0300  4    given to the Maryland militia. Morgan immediately disposed
G58 0310  2    his troops for action and found he had not long to
G58 0310 13    wait. A body of redcoats were seen marching down a
G58 0320 10    nearby slope, a tempting target for the riflemen, who
G58 0330  6    threw a volley into their ranks and "messed up" the
G58 0340  3    smart formation considerably. Now the riflemen and
G58 0340 10    the Marylanders followed up their beginning and closed
G58 0350  8    in on the British, giving them another telling round
G58 0360  6    of fire. The redcoats ran like rabbits. But the Maryland
G58 0370  5    militia had likewise fled, all too typical of this
G58 0380  3    type of soldier during the Revolution, an experience
G58 0380 11    which gave Morgan little confidence in militia in general,
G58 0390  8    as he watched other instances of their breaking in
G58 0400  6    hot engagements. The British, although suffering considerable
G58 0410  3    losses, noted the defection of the Marylanders, made
G58 0420  2    a stand, then turned and attacked Morgan who became
G58 0420 11    greatly outnumbered and had to retire.
G58 0430  6       The Americans lost forty-four men, among them Major
G58 0440  5    Joseph Morris of Morgan's regiment, an officer who
G58 0450  3    was regarded with high esteem and affection, not only
G58 0450 12    by his commander, but by Washington and Lafayette as
G58 0460  8    well. The latter was so upset on learning of the death
G58 0470  8    of Morris, that he wrote Morgan a letter, showing his
G58 0480  5    own warmhearted generosity. After complimenting Morgan
G58 0490  2    and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to
G58 0490 12    Congress, too, the ardent Frenchman added he felt that
G58 0500  9    Congress should make some financial restitution to
G58 0510  5    the widow and family of Morris, but that he knew Morgan
G58 0520  3    realized how long such action usually required, if
G58 0520 11    it was done at all. "As Mrs. Morris may be in some
G58 0530 11    want before that time", Lafayette continued, "I am
G58 0540  6    going to trouble you with a commission which I beg
G58 0550  4    you will execute with the greatest secrecy. If she
G58 0560  2    wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the
G58 0560 12    arrangements of Congress, it would not become a stranger,
G58 0570  8    unknown to her, to offer himself for that purpose.
G58 0580  4    But you could (as from yourself) tell her that you
G58 0590  2    had friends who, being with the army, don't know what
G58 0590 12    to do with their money and ... would willingly let
G58 0600  8    her have one or many thousand dollars". This was accordingly
G58 0610  5    done, and the plight of the grateful Mrs. Morris was
G58 0620  4    much relieved as a result of the generous loan, the
G58 0630  2    amount of which is not known.
G58 0630  8       Apparently still sensitive about the idea with which
G58 0640  6    General Gates had approached him at Saratoga, namely,
G58 0650  2    that George Washington be replaced, Morgan was vehement
G58 0660  1    in his support of the commander-in-chief during the
G58 0660 11    campaign around Philadelphia. Richard Peters, Secretary
G58 0670  5    of the Board of War, thought Morgan was so extreme
G58 0680  5    on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick
G58 0710  3    a quarrel. Morgan hotly denied this and informed the
G58 0710 12    Board of War that the men in camp linked the name of
G58 0730 12    Peters with the plot against Washington. Peters insisted
G58 0740  5    that this impression was a great misunderstanding,
G58 0750  2    and evidently, from the quarrel, obtained an unfavorable
G58 0760  1    impression of Morgan's judgment. Such a situation regarding
G58 0770  1    the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's
G58 0770 10    chances for promotion when that matter came before
G58 0780  7    the group later on.
G58 0780 11       In late December, the American army moved from Whitemarsh
G58 0790  9    to Valley Forge, and although the distance was only
G58 0800  8    13 miles, the journey took more than a week because
G58 0810  6    of the bad weather, the barefooted and almost naked
G58 0820  2    men. The position of the new camp was admirably selected
G58 0820 12    and well fortified, its easily defensible nature being
G58 0830  8    one good reason why Howe did not attack it. Besides
G58 0840  7    helping to prevent the movement of the British to the
G58 0850  5    west, Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between
G58 0860  1    Howe's forces and the farmers, thus threatening the
G58 0860  9    vital subsistence of the redcoats and rendering their
G58 0870  7    foraging to obtain necessary supplies extremely hazardous.
G58 0880  4    In order to see that this hindering situation remained
G58 0890  3    effective, Washington detached several bodies of his
G58 0900  1    troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area.
G58 0900  9       Morgan and his corps were placed on the west side
G58 0910  9    of the Schuylkill River, with instructions to intercept
G58 0920  4    all supplies found going to the city and to keep a
G58 0930  4    close eye on the movements of the enemy. The headquarters
G58 0940  1    of Morgan was on a farm, said to have been particularly
G58 0940 12    well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from
G58 0950  9    trading with the British, a practice all too common
G58 0960  5    to those who preferred to sell their produce for British
G58 0970  2    gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental
G58 0970  9    currency. In his dealings with offenders, however,
G58 0980  7    Morgan was typically firm but just. For example, he
G58 0990  7    captured some persons from York County, who with teams
G58 1000  4    were taking to Philadelphia the furniture of a man
G58 1010  1    who had just been released from prison through the
G58 1010 10    efforts of his wife, and who apparently was helpless
G58 1020  6    to prevent the theft of his household goods. Morgan
G58 1030  3    took charge of the furniture and restored it to its
G58 1040  1    thankful owners, but he let the culprits who had stolen
G58 1040 11    it go free.
G58 1050  1       Morgan complained to Washington about the men detailed
G58 1050  9    to him for scouting duty, most of them he said being
G58 1060 10    useless. "They straggle at such a rate", he told the
G58 1070  8    commander-in-chief, "that if the enemy were enterprising,
G58 1080  4    they might get two from us, when we would take one
G58 1090  2    of them, which makes me wish General Howe would go
G58 1090 12    on, lest any incident happen to us".
G58 1100  5       If the hardships of the winter at Valley Forge were
G58 1110  4    trying for healthy men, they were, of course, much
G58 1120  1    more so for those not in good health. Daniel Morgan's
G58 1120 11    rheumatic condition worsened with the increase of the
G58 1130  7    cold and damp weather. He had braved the elements and
G58 1140  6    the enemy, but the strain, aided by the winter, was
G58 1150  2    catching up with him at last. Also, he was now forty-three
G58 1160  1    years old. The mild activity of his command during
G58 1160 10    the sojourn of the troops at Valley Forge could be
G58 1170  7    handled by a subordinate, he felt, so like Henry Knox,
G58 1180  5    equally loyal to Washington, who went to Boston at
G58 1190  2    this time, Morgan received permission to visit his
G58 1190 10    home in Virginia for several weeks. In his absence,
G58 1200  7    the rifle regiment was under the command of Major Thomas
G58 1210  6    Posey, another able Virginian.
G58 1220  1       But Morgan did not leave before he had written a
G58 1220 11    letter to a William Pickman in Salem, Massachusetts,
G58 1230  5    apparently an acquaintance, praising Washington and
G58 1240  3    saying that the slanders propagated about him were
G58 1250  1    "opposed by the general current of the people ... to
G58 1250 11    exalt General Gates at the expense of General Washington
G58 1260  8    was injurious to the latter. If there be a disinterested
G58 1270  6    patriot in America, 'tis General Washington, and his
G58 1280  4    bravery, none can question".
G58 1280  8       It is doubtful if Morgan was able to take home much
G58 1290  9    money to his wife and children, for his pay, as shown
G58 1300  6    by the War Department Abstracts of early 1778 was $75
G58 1310  4    a month as a colonel, and that apt to be delayed. He
G58 1320  1    was shown a warm welcome regardless, and spent the
G58 1320 10    time in Winchester recuperating from his ailment, enjoying
G58 1330  6    his family and arranging his private affairs which
G58 1340  4    were, of course, run down. His neighbors celebrated
G58 1350  1    his return, even if it was only temporary, and Morgan
G58 1350 11    was especially gratified by the quaint expression of
G58 1360  7    an elderly friend, Isaac Lane, who told him, "A man
G58 1370  7    that has so often left all that is dear to him, as
G58 1380  4    thou hast, to serve thy country, must create a sympathetic
G58 1390  1    feeling in every patriotic heart".
G58 1390  6       There must have been special feelings of joy and
G58 1400  5    patriotism in the heart of Daniel Morgan too, when
G58 1410  2    the news was received on April 30th of the recognition
G58 1410 12    by France of the independence of the United States.
G58 1420  8    His fellow Virginian, George Washington, had stated,
G58 1430  5    "I believe no event was ever received with more heartfelt
G58 1440  4    joy". The dreary camp at Valley Forge was turned into
G58 1450  4    an arena of rejoicing. Even the dignified Washington
G58 1460  1    indulged in a game of wickets with some children. His
G58 1460 11    soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly.
G58 1470  7    On May 6th, Morgan, who had returned, received from
G58 1480  3    Washington orders to "send out patrols under vigilant
G58 1490  2    officers" to keep near the enemy. "The reason for this",
G58 1500  1    the orders said, "is that the enemy may think to take
G58 1500 12    advantage of the celebration of this day. The troops
G58 1510  8    must have more than the common quantity of liquor,
G58 1520  4    and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness among
G58 1530  2    them".
G58 1530  3       Apparently no serious disorders resulted from the
G58 1540  2    celebration, and within a few days, Morgan joined the
G58 1540 11    force of Lafayette who now had command of some 2,000
G58 1550  9    men at Barren Hill, not far above Philadelphia on the
G58 1560  6    Schuylkill. The Frenchman had been ordered to approach
G58 1570  4    the enemy's lines, harass them and get intelligence
G58 1580  1    of their movements. Interestingly enough, the order
G58 1580  8    transmitted to Morgan through Alexander Hamilton also
G58 1590  7    informed him that "A party of Indians will join the
G58 1600  6    party to be sent from your command at Whitemarsh, and
G58 1610  2    act with them". These were Oneida Indians.
G58 1620  1       Washington evidently was anxious for Morgan to be
G58 1620  8    cautious as well as aggressive, for on May 17th, 18th
G58 1630  8    and 20th he admonished the leader of the riflemen-rangers
G58 1640  5    to be on the alert. Obviously the commander-in-chief
G58 1650  1    had confidence that Morgan would furnish him good intelligence
G58 1660  1    too, for on the 23rd of May, he told Morgan that the
G58 1660 13    British were prepared to move, perhaps in the night,
G58 1670  8    and asked Morgan to have two of his best horses ready
G58 1680  6    to dispatch to General Smallwood with the intelligence
G58 1690  2    obtained. Meantime, however, this same General Smallwood
G58 1700  1    seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American
G58 1700 11    army. Colonel Benjamin Ford wrote to Morgan from Wilmington
G58 1710  8    that he understood a Mrs. Sanderson from Maryland had
G58 1720  7    obtained permission from Smallwood to visit Philadelphia,
G58 1730  4    and would return on May 26th, escorted by several officers
G58 1740  4    from Maryland "belonging to the new levies in the British
G58 1750  4    service". Ford urged Morgan to capture these men, who,
G58 1760  2    he thought, might be disguised as Quakers or peasants.
G58 1760 11    Morgan took the suggested steps, but when Mrs. Sanderson
G58 1770  8    appeared, there was nobody with her but her husband,
G58 1780  7    whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned.
G58 1790  4    But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence
G58 1800  1    much more important to his commanding general. A letter
G58 1800 10    of a few days later from Washington's aide to Morgan
G58 1810  9    stated, "His Excellency is highly pleased with your
G58 1820  6    conduct upon this occasion".
