G52 0010  1    "Let him become honest, and they discard him.- But
G52 0010 10    let him be ready to invent whatever falsehood- to assail
G52 0020  7    whatever character- and to prostitute his paper to
G52 0030  6    whatever ends- and they hug him to their heart. In
G52 0040  3    proportion to the degradation of his moral worth, is
G52 0040 12    the increase of his worth to them".
G52 0050  7       To exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate
G52 0060  4    himself from a sticky situation, Pike took another
G52 0070  1    course and made it appear that the legislature had
G52 0070 10    been bilked. He claimed in his attacks that Woodruff,
G52 0080  7    with scurrilous underhandedness, had deliberately written
G52 0090  4    an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members
G52 0100  3    of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract
G52 0110  1    without knowing what they were doing.
G52 0110  7       The charge was so farfetched that Woodruff paid
G52 0120  4    little attention to it, and answered Pike in a rather
G52 0130  4    bored way, wearily declaring that a "new hand" was
G52 0140  1    pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ, and concluding:
G52 0140 10    "In a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute
G52 0150  9    of moral principles, even a triumph would entitle the
G52 0160  7    victor to no laurels. The game is not worth the ammunition
G52 0170  6    it would cost. We therefore leave the writer to the
G52 0180  3    enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal
G52 0180 11    abuse he has heaped on us will entitle him to from
G52 0190 11    the low and vulgar herd to which he belongs".
G52 0200  5       Despite Woodruff's continuing refusal to debate
G52 0210  3    with Pike through the columns of his newspaper, Pike
G52 0220  1    did not let up his attack for a moment. Over the months
G52 0220 13    he became a political gadfly with an incessant barrage
G52 0230  7    of satirical poems ridiculing Woodruff, the "Casca"
G52 0240  4    letters belittling Woodruff, and long analytical articles
G52 0250  3    vilifying Woodruff. So persistent were these attacks
G52 0260  1    that in March of the following year, Woodruff was finally
G52 0260 11    moved to action, and Pike was to learn his first lesson
G52 0270 11    in frontier politics, the subtle art of diversion.
G52 0280  6       To attack Pike directly would gain Woodruff little,
G52 0290  4    for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing to lose.
G52 0300  3    By this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike
G52 0300 11    as a man of great personal pride, a man who would fly
G52 0310 11    into a towering rage if his integrity were questioned,
G52 0320  6    and who would be anxious to avenge himself. Pike's
G52 0330  2    honor would now come under attack, but not by Woodruff
G52 0340  1    himself. The charges would be made in the Gazette by
G52 0340 11    an anonymous correspondent, and Pike would be so busy
G52 0350  8    trying to track down the illusive character assassin
G52 0360  4    that he would forget about harassing Woodruff. The
G52 0370  2    strategy worked perfectly.
G52 0370  5       Pike was stunned by the first blast against his
G52 0380  5    character, which was published in the March 4th issue
G52 0390  3    of the Gazette under the name "Vale". The anonymous
G52 0400  1    correspondent did not resort to innuendoes. He called
G52 0400  9    Pike a thief. He said Pike had stolen mules from Harris
G52 0410  9    during the Santa Fe expedition; he accused Pike of
G52 0420  6    continuing his sticky-fingered career in Arkansas with
G52 0430  4    the theft of some otter skins in Van Buren. The charges
G52 0440  2    caught Pike off balance, coming as they did from an
G52 0440 12    unexpected quarter. Outraged, he used the Advocate
G52 0450  7    of March 7th for a denial, sending immediately to Santa
G52 0460  6    Fe and Van Buren for documents to vindicate himself,
G52 0470  4    and demanding that Woodruff reveal the name of this
G52 0480  3    perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a
G52 0480 10    pastoral pseudonym.
G52 0490  1       Woodruff said nothing, and Pike, frustrated, stormed
G52 0500  1    throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for
G52 0500  9    "Vale", asking his friends to keep their ears open.
G52 0510  8    Finally he learned through the grapevine that the culprit
G52 0520  6    might be one James W. Robinson in Pope County. Without
G52 0530  4    further inquiry, Pike jumped to the conclusion that
G52 0540  2    Robinson was guilty, and, following the honorable route
G52 0540 10    that would eventually lead to the dueling ground, sent
G52 0560  8    a message to Robinson through his friends, demanding
G52 0570  5    that he either confirm or deny his complicity. Robinson
G52 0580  2    did neither. To Pike, silence was tantamount to an
G52 0590  1    admission of guilt, and he determined to get Robinson
G52 0590 10    onto the dueling ground at all costs. On April 11th
G52 0600  8    he wrote an open letter in the Advocate, making it
G52 0610  4    known "to the world that Jas. W. Robinson is by his
G52 0620  4    own admission a base LIAR and a SLANDERER".
G52 0630  1       If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer, he was also
G52 0640  1    a very canny gentleman, for nothing that Pike could
G52 0640 10    do would pry so much as a single word out of him. Preoccupied
G52 0650 10    with his own defense and his attempts to get Robinson
G52 0660  6    to fight, Pike lessened his attacks on Woodruff, and
G52 0670  4    finally stopped them altogether. And Pike never did
G52 0680  1    find out if Robinson was really responsible for the
G52 0680 10    "Vale" letter. Woodruff's strategy had been immensely
G52 0690  6    successful.
G52 0690  7       It took Pike a long time to realize what Woodruff
G52 0700 10    had done, and it had a profound effect on him. Once
G52 0710  7    he learned a lesson, he never forgot it. In the next
G52 0720  4    few months of comparative silence, Pike waited patiently
G52 0730  1    until conditions were perfect for a new attack, and
G52 0730 10    then, displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties
G52 0740  7    of political infighting, gained from his first bout
G52 0750  5    with Woodruff, he used these changed conditions to
G52 0760  2    excellent advantage.
G52 0760  4       Shortly after the "Vale" incident, a rift began
G52 0770  4    to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope.
G52 0780  1    One-armed, gruff, frugally honest, Governor Pope had
G52 0780  9    been the ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after
G52 0790  9    the disgraceful antics of political bosses like Crittenden,
G52 0800  5    and he ruled the state with an iron fist, tolerating
G52 0810  3    no nonsense. Woodruff had supported him all the way,
G52 0820  1    both as a chief executive and as a man. Besides being
G52 0820 12    political allies, they were also friends. This warm
G52 0830  7    relationship came to an abrupt end in June of 1834
G52 0840  6    when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 for
G52 0850  2    compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory,
G52 0850 10    and, taking note of the recent wave of corruption in
G52 0860 10    the legislature, left it to the governor to award the
G52 0870  8    contract.
G52 0870  9       Woodruff wanted this political windfall very badly,
G52 0880  5    and everyone assumed that he would get it because he
G52 0890  4    was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest
G52 0890 14    supporter. After all, Woodruff owned a competent printing
G52 0900  8    plant and was the logical man for the job. But because
G52 0910  9    the governor was determined that friendship should
G52 0920  4    not influence him one way or the other, he looked for
G52 0930  2    a printer with a knowledge of the law (which Woodruff
G52 0930 12    did not have), and awarded the contract to a lawyer
G52 0940  9    named John Steele who had started a newspaper in Helena
G52 0950  7    the year before.
G52 0950 10       Woodruff was furious. Considering the governor's
G52 0960  5    act a personal rebuff, he aired his feelings in the
G52 0970  5    Gazette on August 26, 1834: "We think the governor
G52 0980  3    treated us rather shabbily, to say the least of it.
G52 0980 13    ... It is but justice to Mr. Steele for us to add that,
G52 0990 13    in the above remarks, nothing is intended to his disparagement,
G52 1000  8    either as a lawyer or as a printer. He got a good fat
G52 1010 10    job and we congratulate him on his good luck. We hope
G52 1020  5    that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle
G52 1030  1    him to credit".
G52 1030  4       As summer cooled into fall and winter, even so the
G52 1040  4    relationship between the two men continued to grow
G52 1040 12    colder by the day, and by December of 1834 it was icy.
G52 1050 12    It was at this point that Pike decided to capitalize
G52 1060  6    on the bad feelings between the two men. The eventual
G52 1070  4    prize in this new battle was the public printing contract
G52 1080  1    that Woodruff still held.
G52 1080  5       From his first bout with the canny Woodruff, Pike
G52 1090  4    had learned that it was better not to attack him directly,
G52 1100  2    so, harping on the theme that the cost of printing
G52 1100 12    was too high, he condemned the governor for permitting
G52 1110  8    such a state of affairs to exist. To document his charge,
G52 1120  7    Pike set up two parallel columns in the Advocate showing
G52 1130  5    the price charged by the Gazette and the considerably
G52 1140  3    lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere.
G52 1150  1    Then he called on the governor to explain why.
G52 1150 10       The governor was not used to having his integrity
G52 1160  8    questioned, and he promptly passed the charges on to
G52 1170  6    Woodruff, demanding that Woodruff answer them. If Woodruff
G52 1180  3    could not furnish a strong explanation, the governor
G52 1190  1    insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the
G52 1190 11    scale printed in the Advocate. Woodruff was now impaled
G52 1200  7    on the horns of a dilemma. As a proud man, his prestige
G52 1210  7    would suffer if he let Pike dictate to him through
G52 1220  4    the governor's office, but to lower his prices would
G52 1230  1    be tantamount to an admission that they had been too
G52 1230 11    high in the first place. As a consequence, he did neither.
G52 1240  8    Very angry at Woodruff, the governor used his personal
G52 1250  6    influence to have the printing contract withdrawn from
G52 1260  3    the Gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder, which,
G52 1270  1    by a strange coincidence, happened to be Pike's Advocate.
G52 1280  1    And, for the moment at least, the governor now found
G52 1280 11    himself allied with the head of the Crittenden faction
G52 1290  7    he had formerly opposed, and Pike was credited with
G52 1300  4    a clear triumph over Woodruff.
G52 1300  9       But in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics,
G52 1320  6    alliances were as quickly broken as they were formed,
G52 1330  6    and as Pike came to favor with the governor of the
G52 1340  3    Territory, the governor fell out of favor with the
G52 1340 12    President of the United States. On January 28, 1835,
G52 1350  9    Andrew Jackson removed Pope from office and elevated
G52 1360  6    Territorial Secretary William S. Fulton to the position.
G52 1370  6    Fulton was a very close friend of Jackson, and had
G52 1380  3    been his private secretary for a number of years in
G52 1380 13    the old days. As a stanch party man and a rabid Democrat,
G52 1390 12    he had little tolerance for Whigs like Pike, and Pike
G52 1400  8    lost any immediate personal advantage his victory over
G52 1410  5    Woodruff might have gained him.
G52 1410 10    #2#
G52 1420  1    As Pike proved himself adept in the political arena,
G52 1420 10    he also became a social lion in the village of Little
G52 1430  9    Rock, where he served as a symbol of the culture that
G52 1440  5    the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly to
G52 1450  2    cultivate. After all, Pike was an established poet
G52 1450 10    and his work had been published in the respectable
G52 1460  7    periodicals of that center of American culture, Boston.
G52 1470  4    His accomplishments, and the fact that he was resident,
G52 1480  3    did much to offset the unkind words travelers used
G52 1480 12    to describe Little Rock after a visit there. For some
G52 1490 10    reason, none of them were impressed with the territorial
G52 1500  7    capital. The internationally known sportsman and traveler
G52 1510  5    Friedrich Gersta^cker was typical of its detractors
G52 1520  3    in the mid-thirties. "Little Rock is a vile, detestable
G52 1530  1    place ...". he wrote. "Little Rock is, without any
G52 1530 10    flattery, one of the dullest towns in the United States
G52 1540 10    and I would not have remained two hours in the place,
G52 1550  7    if I had not met with some good friends who made me
G52 1560  4    forget its dreariness".
G52 1560  7       Pike enjoyed his new social position tremendously,
G52 1570  5    and cultivated in himself those traits necessary to
G52 1580  3    its preservation. He was especially popular with women,
G52 1590  1    for, like the romantic poetry he wrote, he was personally
G52 1590 11    gracious, gallant, and chivalrous. He again began to
G52 1600  8    play the violin, and tucking the instrument beneath
G52 1610  4    his chin, performed soulful and romantic airs to match
G52 1620  3    the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who
G52 1620 13    gathered to hear him. His artistic accomplishments
G52 1630  7    guaranteed him entry into any social gathering. He
G52 1640  5    composed songs and set them to music and sang them
G52 1650  3    in a soft, melodious voice, and when his audience had
G52 1650 13    had enough of music he would discourse on politics
G52 1660  8    or tell stories of his western adventures guaranteed
G52 1670  3    to excite the emotions of men and women alike.
G52 1690  1       The bulk of his early reputation, however, came
G52 1690  9    not from his poetry or his music, but from his excellence
G52 1700 10    as an orator. By 1834 the art of oratory had reached
G52 1710  7    a very high level in the United States as a literary
G52 1720  4    form. The orator of this period, in order to earn a
G52 1730  1    reputation, had to pay close attention to the formal
G52 1730 10    composition of his speech, judging how it would appear
G52 1740  7    in print as well as the effect it would have on the
G52 1750  6    audience that heard it.
G52 1750 10       Very soon after his arrival in Little Rock, Pike
G52 1760  6    had joined one of the most influential organizations
G52 1770  2    in town, the Little Rock Debating Society, and it was
G52 1780  2    with this group that he made his debut as an orator,
G52 1780 13    being invited to deliver the annual Fourth of July
G52 1790  8    address the club sponsored every year.
