L03 0010  1       The fat man said, "All we gotta do is go around
L03 0010 12    the corner".
L03 0020  1       The gun moved. The thin man said, "That-a-way".
L03 0030  1       "- second building on the right".
L03 0030  6       "- it says police right on the door".
L03 0040  5       "- so even if we was as dumb as you take us for,
L03 0050  4    we could still find it".
L03 0050  9       Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door.
L03 0060  6    The thin man waved the gun again. He said, "Right around
L03 0070  3    the corner".
L03 0070  5       "It says water works, but there is a policeman on
L03 0080  6    duty, too".
L03 0080  8       "A night policeman just like in the States. You
L03 0090  6    know"?
L03 0090  7       "Canada doesn't have much of this here juvenile
L03 0100  6    delinquency problem, but we keep a night policeman
L03 0110  2    all the same on account of the crazy tourists".
L03 0110 11       At the door, Dave paused to feel for the latch.
L03 0120 10    Roberta glanced up at her husband. He was going to
L03 0130  7    be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that
L03 0140  4    gun pointed at him. She measured the distance from
L03 0140 13    where they stood to the men and the gun, measured the
L03 0150 11    distance from the men to the back room. She decided
L03 0160  8    to risk it. There was something phony about all this
L03 0170  4    gun waving- something not quite what it seemed in the
L03 0180  2    detailed directions for finding the police.
L03 0180  8       Dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed
L03 0190  9    his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open.
L03 0200  6    In a flash she was away to the back, paying no attention
L03 0210  3    to three angry shouts from the male throats. She tore
L03 0210 13    open the back door. It was dark inside the room but
L03 0220 11    enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her
L03 0230  6    to enable her to make out a round table with a green
L03 0240  4    cloth top. There was a small sideboard with some empty
L03 0250  1    beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs.
L03 0250 10       Slowly she turned to face the men again. Rat-face
L03 0260 10    at the counter was on his feet. The distance between
L03 0270  5    where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside
L03 0280  3    door was a hundred miles. Keeping her frightened gaze
L03 0280 12    on the men at the counter, she began to feel her way
L03 0290 12    to the door. She sidled along the booths one step at
L03 0300  8    a time. The gun followed her.
L03 0310  1       As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her,
L03 0310 12    felt him pull her to the safety of his person, she
L03 0320  9    knew with the certainty of despair that something bad
L03 0330  4    had happened to Lauren.
L03 0330  8       The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind
L03 0340  9    them, watched them cross the sidewalk to their car.
L03 0350  5    It was getting light. The fat man removed his apron,
L03 0360  3    put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket, and zipped it
L03 0360 13    over his paunch.
L03 0370  2       The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed
L03 0370 12    a number. When he was answered, he said, "Albert? Vince.
L03 0380 10    I'm sending you a couple of customers- yeah- just get
L03 0390  9    them out of my hair and keep them out- I don't give
L03 0400  8    a damn what you tell them- only don't believe a word
L03 0410  5    they say- they're out to make trouble for me and it
L03 0420  4    is up to you to stop them- I don't care how- and one
L03 0430  1    more thing- Cate's Cafe closed at eleven like always
L03 0430 10    last night and Rose and Clarence Corsi left for Quebec
L03 0440  9    yesterday- some shrine or other- I think it was called
L03 0450  8    Saint Simon's- yeah, yesterday. Got it"?
L03 0460  3       He turned from the phone and strode to the front
L03 0470  3    of the restaurant. The white Buick hadn't moved away
L03 0470 12    yet. Good. A line of worry formed, a twitch pulled
L03 0480 10    his mouth over to one side.
L03 0490  2       He said, "Grosse? You ain't kidding me- the kid
L03 0500  2    don't know the name of this town"?
L03 0500  9       "I ain't kidding you, Vince. How could she? She
L03 0510  7    musta been walking in her sleep- you seen her yourself
L03 0520  7    in here".
L03 0520  9       "Howda I know"?
L03 0530  1       "Remember how she looked when Barney held the door
L03 0530 10    for her? Kinda like a zombie? She was just waking up
L03 0540 10    when we found her at the garage".
L03 0550  3       Vince swore. "Stupid fools- ain't got enough brains
L03 0560  3    between the two of you"-
L03 0560  8       Grosse muttered, his head down, one hand playing
L03 0570  6    with the zipper on his jacket. "- had enough brains
L03 0580  3    to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when
L03 0580 16    the parents- I coulda let her go go"- His eyes were
L03 0590 10    lowered, so he couldn't have seen the narrow, pointed
L03 0600  8    face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury; but
L03 0610  5    he was aware of it just the same. He knew Vince Steiner
L03 0620  3    was one of those men who had to work up a fury once
L03 0630  1    in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be.
L03 0630 12       With a curse, Vince seized the thing nearest, a
L03 0640  7    glass sugar container with a spouted metal top, and
L03 0650  4    threw it against the wall opposite. The heavy glass
L03 0660  1    didn't break, but the top flew off; sugar sprayed with
L03 0660 11    a hiss that was loud in the silence.
L03 0670  7       Not really startled, but careful to appear so, Grosse
L03 0680  5    sucked noisily on his pipe. Vince cursed steadily.
L03 0690  1    "Why does everything have to happen to me"?
L03 0690  9       Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep
L03 0700  9    up the sugar. Vince watched him. His mouth worked over
L03 0710  6    the profanity, the obscenities in his vocabulary. Once
L03 0720  2    he said, "Why'n hell didn't you look in the back seat
L03 0730  2    of the car before you drove off? Don't you and Barney
L03 0730 13    ever use your brains"?
L03 0740  4       The fat man didn't answer. He got one of the menus
L03 0750  4    and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it
L03 0750 14    to a box on the floor behind the counter. He returned
L03 0760 11    the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper
L03 0770  7    napkin dispenser.
L03 0770  9       He spoke soothingly. "She don't know nothing about
L03 0780  7    them cars. She thinks she's in a ordinary garage".
L03 0790  6       "How do you know, stupid? And put Cate's gun back".
L03 0800  6       "I know". Grosse tucked the gun under the counter.
L03 0810  6       "- one word of this gets to Guardino"-
L03 0820  1       "Who's telling Guardino"?
L03 0820  4       Vince swore again. "You get that kid over to Rose's
L03 0830 10    house".
L03 0840  1       The fat man winced. He ran a finger down his cheek,
L03 0840 12    tracing the scratch there. "Why can't I leave her locked
L03 0850  8    up in the tool crib"?
L03 0860  1       The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance
L03 0860 11    at the clock. "You and Barney get her over to Rose's
L03 0870 11    before it gets too light. After Guardino's left, we'll
L03 0880  7    dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin
L03 0890  7    get home. God help you if she knows where she's been".
L03 0900  3       Grosse spread his hands. "What am I going to do
L03 0910  3    with her all day? In the tool crib she can't get away".
L03 0920  1       "What the hell do I care what you do with her all
L03 0920 13    day? Just get her where Guardino won't see her and
L03 0930 10    start asking questions".
L03 0940  1       Grosse swore now. "Dammit all, Vince. I ain't no
L03 0950  1    baby sitter".
L03 0950  3       Vince shouted finally, "Get her over to Rose's and
L03 0960  2    I'll come by and see that she stays put".
L03 0960 11       Grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was
L03 0970 10    swollen. He spoke sullenly. "You don't hafta get nasty.
L03 0980  6    I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid". Suddenly
L03 0990  5    he grinned. His voice lost its sullen tones and he
L03 1000  4    chuckled. "I got one question".
L03 1000  9       "What is it"? Impatiently.
L03 1010  2       "Are you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart aleck from
L03 1020  3    the States"?
L03 1020  5       Vince lifted his hand as if to strike, but his thin
L03 1030  5    lips spread in a smile. Grosse ducked and sniggered.
L03 1040  1    "Where'd you say you was born"?
L03 1040  7       "In a Chicago slum just like you. And I ain't going
L03 1050  9    back there on account of one lousy kid".
L03 1060  4    ##
L03 1060  5    Lauren Landis rubbed her face against the blanket.
L03 1070  1    She had cried a little because she was frightened.
L03 1070 10    She could easily understand why the two men had been
L03 1080  9    startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of
L03 1090  7    their car (she had figured that out), but she couldn't
L03 1100  3    understand their subsequent actions. Was it because
L03 1110  1    she had shown panic? Who could blame her for that?
L03 1110 11    It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where
L03 1120  7    your parents were eating and quite another to awaken
L03 1130  5    in a strange garage and know your parents had gone
L03 1140  2    on home without you.
L03 1140  6       She was glad the fat man had left. Barney was not
L03 1150  3    really frightening. She jumped as the little man now
L03 1150 12    appeared at the window and, reaching through the opening,
L03 1160  9    offered her a bottle of coke. She smiled at him wetly.
L03 1170  9    Although she found she was thirsty, she was about to
L03 1180  6    refuse (never, never take candy from a strange man)
L03 1190  2    when she saw the bottle was unopened. He placed a bottle
L03 1190 13    opener on the counter. So, he understood her panic.
L03 1200  9    She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle.
L03 1210  9    It was icy cold and tasted delicious. She felt a lift
L03 1220  6    in spirit. When she was finished she pushed it back.
L03 1230  3    The man was busy doing something to the inside of the
L03 1230 14    door-frame on the driver's side of a car.
L03 1240  8       She called softly, "Barney".
L03 1250  1       He looked in her direction but he didn't answer.
L03 1260  1       She said, "Barney, why is he keeping me here"?
L03 1270  1       Still no answer. He seemed to be looking at a point
L03 1270 12    above the little window.
L03 1280  2       Lauren said, "Why can't I call my home? Or borrow
L03 1290  2    some money from someone and go home by bus? I could
L03 1290 13    send the money right back".
L03 1300  4       Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking.
L03 1310  2    He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with
L03 1310 12    the sole of his heavy shoe. Now he looked at her. He
L03 1320 12    said, "I only work here".
L03 1330  2       Lauren said, "Please"? But he was back at work on
L03 1340  3    a car.
L03 1340  5       She dropped her head on her arms on the counter.
L03 1350  1    How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next?
L03 1350 12    Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry
L03 1360  9    for her? And was he afraid to do anything as definite
L03 1370  6    as releasing her? Her heart was thumping painfully;
L03 1380  2    the unknown was so much worse than- what dangers lay
L03 1390  1    ahead for her? What awful thing had she to face in
L03 1390 12    the next few hours? Something wet and hot was trickling
L03 1400  8    on her wrists. Tears?
L03 1410  1       With a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away
L03 1410 12    from herself; as long as she could do nothing constructive
L03 1420  9    about the situation she was in, she would think about
L03 1430  8    something else. Her mother and father, for instance.
L03 1440  3    Where were they now? In her mind she followed the white
L03 1450  3    Buick along the road somewhere between here and the
L03 1450 12    Niagara River. Her father's attention would be on the
L03 1460  9    road ahead and it wouldn't deviate an inch until he
L03 1470  7    crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River
L03 1480  5    Road to LaSalle and, finally, turned in at their own
L03 1490  2    driveway at 387 Heather Heights. Then he would yawn
L03 1490 11    and stretch and shout, "All out. This is the end of
L03 1500 10    the line".
L03 1500 12       And what would her mother be doing right now? Her
L03 1510 10    mother would be fast asleep curled up against that
L03 1520  6    wonderful, big, safe, solid shoulder next to her on
L03 1530  4    the front seat.
L03 1530  7       Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone.
L03 1540  4    ##
L03 1540  5    Roberta Landis put her hand on her husband's arm as
L03 1550  3    he slid in the driver's seat beside her. Somewhere
L03 1550 12    birds were sweetly calling, were answered. Her teeth
L03 1560  8    chattered so that she made three attempts at speech
L03 1570  6    before she became intelligible.
L03 1580  1       "Dave. I saw that woman's apron behind the door.
L03 1580  9    There was a wet spot- she couldn't have been gone long".
L03 1590  7       Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement.
L03 1600  6    He inserted the car key in the lock. Roberta was violently
L03 1610  4    trembling.
L03 1610  5       She stammered, "You heard what he said about police?
L03 1620  6    Why don't we drive around the corner"?
L03 1630  1       The car door crashed shut. The engine throbbed into
L03 1630 10    life. Dave said, "I got the message. We're going".
L03 1650  1       Roberta said, "No. You go. Walk. Suppose Lauren
L03 1650  9    comes looking for us? I can sit here in the car while
L03 1660 12    you walk around the corner".
L03 1670  3       The big car sprang away from the curb like something
L03 1680  1    alive. He said, "I'm not going to leave my wife and
L03 1680 12    my car out here in sight of those"-
L03 1690  7       Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling.
