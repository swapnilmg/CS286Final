B15 0010  1       The Providence Journal editorial (Jan. 25) entitled
B15 0010  8    "East Greenwich Faces a Housing Development Problem"
B15 0020  7    points to a dilemma that faces communities such as
B15 0030  7    ours. Your suggested solution, it seems to me, is grossly
B15 0040  7    oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally
B15 0050  2    realistic attitude toward, and endorsement of, sound
B15 0050  9    planning.
B15 0060  1       First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich
B15 0060 11    already zoned in the classification similar to that
B15 0070  8    which petitioner requested. This land is in various
B15 0080  6    stages of development in several locations throughout
B15 0090  2    the town. The demand for these lots can be met for
B15 0090 13    some time to come. This would seem to indicate that
B15 0100 10    we are trying neither "to halt an influx of migrants"
B15 0110  7    nor are we "setting up such standards for development
B15 0120  3    that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and
B15 0130  3    build in the new sites".
B15 0130  8       What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain
B15 0140  6    a balance between medium density and low density residential
B15 0150  2    areas and industrial and commercial development. It
B15 0160  1    is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion
B15 0160  9    of modest industrial development to help pay governmental
B15 0170  6    costs. Bostitch, Inc. is approximately half way through
B15 0180  5    a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax. The wisdom
B15 0190  4    of granting such tax exemptions is another matter,
B15 0200  1    but this particular instance is, in my opinion, completely
B15 0200 10    satisfactory. The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich
B15 0210  8    indicates a valuation for this property in excess of
B15 0220  5    two million dollars. With our current $3 per hundred
B15 0230  2    tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify
B15 0230 13    when you suggest a community should "try to develop
B15 0240  8    a modest industrial plant" as the best way to meet
B15 0250  7    these problems.
B15 0250  9       In order to attract additional industry that is
B15 0260  5    compatible with this community it is all the more important
B15 0270  5    to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance
B15 0280  2    in the tax structure. As this tax base grows so then
B15 0280 13    can your medium and low density residential areas grow.
B15 0290  8    Mr. Richard Preston, executive director of the New
B15 0300  6    Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission,
B15 0310  3    in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial
B15 0320  3    Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned
B15 0330  1    against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry
B15 0330  9    solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal
B15 0340  8    services such as schools when he said: "If this is
B15 0350  6    the fundamental reason for a community's interest or
B15 0360  3    if this is the basic approach, success if any will
B15 0360 13    be difficult to obtain". He went on to say: "In the
B15 0370 10    first place, industry per se is not dedicated to the
B15 0380  8    role of savior of foundering municipalities. It is
B15 0390  3    not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased
B15 0400  1    municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may
B15 0400 11    be".
B15 0410  1       While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase
B15 0410  8    in school costs in answer to a direct question from
B15 0420  9    a taxpayer, the impact upon a school system does not
B15 0430  6    have to be measured only in increased taxes to find
B15 0440  3    alarm in uncontrolled growth. We in East Greenwich
B15 0440 11    have the example of two neighboring communities, one
B15 0450  7    currently utilizing double sessions in their schools,
B15 0460  5    and the other facing this prospect next year. It has
B15 0470  3    already been reported in your newspapers that the East
B15 0470 12    Greenwich School Committee is considering additions
B15 0480  6    to at least one elementary school and to the high school
B15 0490  8    to insure future accommodations for a school population
B15 0500  5    that we know will increase. If they are to be commended
B15 0510  3    for foresight in their planning, what then is the judgment
B15 0520  1    of a town council that compounds this problem during
B15 0520 10    the planning stage? Where then is the sound planning
B15 0530  7    and cooperation between agencies within the community
B15 0540  4    that you have called for in other editorials? I submit
B15 0550  3    that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are
B15 0550 13    not facing the facts of life.
B15 0560  6       The "fruitful course" of metropolitanization that
B15 0570  2    you recommend is currently practiced by the town of
B15 0580  1    East Greenwich and had its inception long before we
B15 0580 10    learned what it was called. For example:
B15 0590  5    _1._
B15 0590  6       The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the
B15 0600  3    radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police
B15 0610  1    Department, thereby eliminating duplication of facilities
B15 0610  7    and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East
B15 0620  8    Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities.
B15 0630  6    _2._
B15 0630  7       The East Greenwich Fire District services parts
B15 0640  5    of Warwick as well as East Greenwich.
B15 0650  1    _3._
B15 0650  2       The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums
B15 0650  9    of money, as do other Kent County communities, for
B15 0660  8    the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital, a
B15 0670  5    regional facility.
B15 0670  7    _4._
B15 0670  8       The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial
B15 0680  6    support from the town of East Greenwich and the City
B15 0690  6    of Warwick to supplement its endowment.
B15 0700  1    _5._
B15 0700  2       Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick,
B15 0710  1    as reported in your newspapers, suggesting investigation
B15 0710  8    of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut
B15 0720  7    and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich.
B15 0730  6    _6._
B15 0730  7       East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island
B15 0740  6    towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode
B15 0750  3    Island Development Council for planning services we
B15 0760  1    could not provide for ourselves.
B15 0760  6    _7._
B15 0760  7       The education program for retarded children conducted
B15 0770  3    by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from
B15 0780  2    at least one neighboring community.
B15 0780  7       I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly
B15 0790  8    concerned with the problem of community growth rate
B15 0800  3    and the relation between types of growth in a town
B15 0810  1    such as East Greenwich. I believe it is an area in
B15 0810 12    which professional planners have failed to set adequate
B15 0820  7    guide posts; and yet they cannot ignore this problem
B15 0830  4    because it concerns the implementation of nearly all
B15 0840  2    the planning programs they have devised. These programs
B15 0840 10    are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens
B15 0850 11    of a community must stand aside while land developers
B15 0860  6    tell them when, where, and in what manner the community
B15 0870  4    shall grow. We have far less to fear in the migrant
B15 0880  1    family than we have in the migrant developer under
B15 0880 10    these conditions.
B15 0890  1       Until professional planners meet this situation
B15 0890  7    squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner
B15 0900 10    acceptable to the courts, I hope we in East Greenwich
B15 0910  7    can continue to shape our own destiny. @
B15 0930  1       I would like very much, on behalf of my husband
B15 0930 11    and myself, to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful
B15 0940  9    people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund.
B15 0950  3       It is indeed true, as stated in the famous novel
B15 0960  2    of our day, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", that "no man
B15 0970  1    is an island, entirely of itself; every man is a piece
B15 0970 12    of the continent, a part of the main".
B15 0980  6       Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Irving J. Fain,
B15 0990  4    president of the Temple Beth El; Rev. DeWitt Clemens,
B15 1000  3    pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church; Mr.
B15 1010  2    Felix Miranda, of the Imperial Knife Co.; and to Mrs.
B15 1020  1    Rozella Switzer, regional director of The National
B15 1020  8    Conference of Christians and Jews, who asked them to
B15 1030  9    serve as a committee for the fund. It is through them
B15 1040  7    that we have become aware of the divine humanity in
B15 1050  3    man, and therefore, that most people are noble, helpful
B15 1060  1    and good.
B15 1060  3       Bless you my friends, for it is through love and
B15 1060 13    service that brotherhood becomes a reality. @
B15 1080  1       I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School.
B15 1080 10    My future plans are to become a language teacher. Of
B15 1090  9    course, having this desire, I am very interested in
B15 1100  6    education.
B15 1100  7       A few weeks ago, I read in the Bulletin that there
B15 1110  6    were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston. The article
B15 1120  3    also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over,
B15 1130  2    and must not be going to high school to attend these
B15 1130 13    classes.
B15 1140  1       The following week, I read in the Sunday paper that
B15 1140 11    the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages
B15 1150  8    in the seventh grade.
B15 1160  1       I wish you could see the situation as I see it.
B15 1160 12    If Russian pupils have to take these languages, how
B15 1170  8    come American students have a choice whether or not
B15 1180  6    to take a language, but have to face so many exceptions?
B15 1190  2       I do not think that America is like Russia, not
B15 1200  2    in the least! I am proud of my country, the small city
B15 1200 14    I live in, my wonderful parents, my friends and my
B15 1210  9    school; but I am also a young, able and willing girl
B15 1220  7    who wants to study the Chinese language but is not
B15 1230  4    old enough.
B15 1230  6       Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced
B15 1240  4    than American students. Well, there lies your answer.

B15 1260  1       At the height of the first snowstorm we had, it
B15 1260 11    was impossible for me to get medical attention needed
B15 1270  8    during an emergency.
B15 1270 11       However, the East Providence Rescue Squad made its
B15 1280  8    way through to my home in time of desperation.
B15 1290  6       Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and
B15 1300  3    comfort their service gave to me. The concern they
B15 1310  1    felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for
B15 1310 13    which I will always be grateful.
B15 1320  3       The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for
B15 1330  2    the fine work they do in all kinds of weather. Had
B15 1330 13    they not gotten me to the hospital when they did, perhaps
B15 1340  9    I would not be here to commend them at this time.
B15 1350  6       Many thanks for a job well done. @
B15 1360  1       The Providence Sunday Journal article (Jan. 29)
B15 1360  8    asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized
B15 1370  6    by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans
B15 1380  9    who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds
B15 1390  2    as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news.
B15 1400  2    Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space
B15 1400 12    on the front page.
B15 1410  2       On the question of admission to Veterans Administration
B15 1420  1    hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected
B15 1420  9    disabled veterans, it must be recognized that there
B15 1430  8    are many men who are greatly affected by war service.
B15 1440  5    It can manifest itself before discharge from service,
B15 1450  2    or it can come out years later. There is one other
B15 1450 13    point we should never lose sight of: Many veterans
B15 1460  9    who enter VA hospitals as non-service cases later
B15 1470  6    qualify as service-connected. No psychiatrist could
B15 1480  2    tell me that the experience in a war can not have its
B15 1490  1    effect in the ensuing years.
B15 1490  6       The arguments advanced by those individuals and
B15 1500  2    groups who oppose the system in force and who would
B15 1500 12    drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital
B15 1510  8    care for the non-service-connected case, seem to be
B15 1520  5    coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes
B15 1530  3    of the general public.
B15 1530  7       I believe in priority for service-connected disabled
B15 1540  4    veterans in admission to VA hospitals. But I don't
B15 1550  4    believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected
B15 1560  1    patients. This matter is of great importance, and the
B15 1560 10    outcome may mean the difference between life or death,
B15 1570  8    or at least serious injuries, for many veterans.
B15 1580  4       Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital
B15 1590  4    is too long. There's a reason for this length of stay.
B15 1600  1    First of all, the admitting physician in the VA hospital
B15 1600 11    gets the patient as a new patient. He has no experience
B15 1610 11    with this veteran's previous medical record. If the
B15 1620  6    doctor is conscientious, he wants to study the patient.
B15 1630  5    As a result, it takes a little longer than it would
B15 1640  3    on the outside where the family physician knows about
B15 1640 12    the patient.
B15 1650  1       Secondly, the VA physician knows that when the
B15 1650  9    patient leaves the hospital, he is no longer going
B15 1660  9    to have a chance to visit his patient. So he keeps
B15 1670  6    the veteran in until he can observe the effects of
B15 1680  2    treatment or surgery.
B15 1680  5       The American public must be presented with the facts
B15 1690  4    concerning VA hospitalization. The public should understand
B15 1700  3    that whether they support a state hospital or a VA
B15 1710  1    hospital, the tax dollar has to be paid one way or
B15 1710 12    the other. The responsibility is still going to be
B15 1720  7    there whether they pay for a VA hospital or the tax
B15 1730  5    dollar is spent for the state hospital. An adequate
B15 1740  2    system of VA hospitals is better equipped to care
B15 1740 11    for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals. @
B15 1760  1       It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization
B15 1760  9    is once more upon us. The American Medical Association
B15 1770  9    is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda
B15 1780  7    based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration
B15 1790  3    medical program to the American taxpayer. Do they,
B15 1800  3    the A.M.A., offer any solution other than outright
B15 1810  1    abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere
B15 1810  8    in the world?
B15 1820  1       We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes
B15 1820 10    the demand for medical care at VA hospitals will grow
B15 1830  9    proportionately as age fosters illness. Nevertheless,
B15 1840  4    we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A. on the health
B15 1850  4    problem confronting the aged. They opposed the Forand
B15 1860  3    bill, which would have placed the major burden of financial
B15 1870  1    support upon the individual himself through compulsory
B15 1870  8    payroll deduction; yet they supported the Eisenhower
B15 1880  6    administration which will cost a small state like ours
B15 1890  7    approximately five million dollars (matched incidentally
B15 1900  2    by a federal grant) to initiate.
