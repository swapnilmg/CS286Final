C09 0010  1       MURRAY LOUIS and his dance company appeared at the
C09 0010 10    Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings
C09 0020  8    and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest
C09 0030  7    work, "Signal", and the repetition of an earlier one,
C09 0040  5    "Journal".
C09 0040  6       "Signal" is choreographed for three male dancers
C09 0050  5    to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais. Its abstract
C09 0060  3    decor is by John Hultberg. Program note reads as follows:
C09 0070  3       "Take hands ... this urgent visage beckons us".
C09 0080  1       Here, as in "Journal", Mr. Louis has given himself
C09 0090  1    the lion's share of the dancing, and there is no doubt
C09 0090 12    that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide
C09 0100  8    variety of difficult and arresting physical movements.
C09 0110  3    Indeed, both "Journal" and "Signal" qualify as instructive
C09 0120  4    catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.
C09 0130  1       But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative,
C09 0130  9    and it is in the realm of communication that the works
C09 0140 11    prove disappointing. One frequently has the feeling
C09 0150  6    that the order of their movement combinations could
C09 0160  2    be transposed without notable loss of effect, there
C09 0160 10    is too little suggestion of organic relationship and
C09 0170  8    development.
C09 0180  1       It may be, of course, that Mr. Louis is consciously
C09 0180 11    trying to create works that anticipate an age of total
C09 0190  8    automation. But it may be, also, that he is merely
C09 0200  6    more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the
C09 0210  3    present time. One thing is certain, however, and that
C09 0210 12    is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents,
C09 0220 10    phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than
C09 0230  8    a confident dance creator need be. @
C09 0240  1    #'AN AMERICAN JOURNEY'#
C09 0240  4    A brisk, satirical spoof of contemporary American mores
C09 0250  3    entitled "An American Journey" was given its first
C09 0260  2    New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last
C09 0260 10    night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company.
C09 0270  9    Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin, the work filled the second
C09 0280  9    half of a program that also offered the first New York
C09 0290  7    showing of Miss Tamiris' "Once Upon a Time ..." as
C09 0300  6    well as her "Women's Song" and Mr. Nagrin's "Indeterminate
C09 0310  4    Figure".
C09 0310  5       Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score
C09 0320  7    for "An American Journey", and Malcolm McCormick gave
C09 0330  5    it sprightly imaginative costumes.
C09 0340  1       Mr. Nagrin has described four "places", each with
C09 0340  9    its scenery and people, added two "diversions", and
C09 0350  7    concluded with "A Toccata for the Young", a refreshingly
C09 0360  7    underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing.
C09 0370  4       The "places" could be anywhere, the idiosyncrasies
C09 0390  1    and foibles observed there could be anybody's, and
C09 0400  1    the laugh is on us all. But we need not mind too much,
C09 0400 14    because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement
C09 0410  7    that is diverting and clever almost all the way.
C09 0420  5       Miss Tamiris' "Once Upon a Time ..." is a problem
C09 0430  5    piece about a man and a woman and the three "figures"
C09 0440  1    that bother them somehow.
C09 0440  5       Unfortunately, the man and woman were not made to
C09 0450  6    appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing
C09 0460  2    figures failed to make them any more so. Nor did the
C09 0460 13    dancing involved really seize the attention at any
C09 0470  8    time. The music here, Russell Smith's "Tetrameron",
C09 0480  3    sounded good.
C09 0480  5       All the performances of the evening were smooth
C09 0490  6    and assured, and the sizable company, with Mr. Nagrin
C09 0500  4    and Marion Scott as its leading dancers, seemed to
C09 0510  2    be fine shape.
C09 0520  1       THE Symphony of the Air, greatly assisted by Van
C09 0520 10    Cliburn, last night got its seven-concert Beethoven
C09 0530  8    cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start. At the
C09 0540  8    same time the orchestra announced that next season
C09 0550  3    it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie,
C09 0550 12    and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs,
C09 0560 11    repeating each of them in five different communities.
C09 0570  7       This news, announced by Jerome Toobin, the orchestra's
C09 0580  6    administrative director, brought applause from the
C09 0590  4    2,800 persons who filled the hall. They showed they
C09 0600  1    were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra
C09 0600 10    playing there so often next season to take up the slack
C09 0610 10    with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York
C09 0620  6    Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston
C09 0630  4    Symphony.
C09 0630  5       This season the orchestra has already taken a step
C09 0640  4    toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription
C09 0650  1    concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester
C09 0650  8    in the County Center in White Plains. The details of
C09 0660  8    the suburban concerts next season, and the centers
C09 0670  6    in which they will be given, will be announced later,
C09 0680  2    Mr. Toobin said.
C09 0680  5    #@#
C09 0680  6    The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated
C09 0690  5    with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia
C09 0700  3    in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky, the Rachmaninoff
C09 0710  1    Third, and the Prokofieff Third. It was pleasant last
C09 0710 10    night, therefore, to hear him do something else: a
C09 0720  8    concerto he has recently recorded, "The Emperor".
C09 0730  3       The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring
C09 0740  4    out as well as anyone, so last night the massive sonorities
C09 0750  1    of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.
C09 0750 10    But they were not what distinguished his performance.
C09 0760  7    The elements that did were the introspective slow movement,
C09 0770  6    the beautiful transition to the third movement, and
C09 0780  4    the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger
C09 0790  1    moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.
C09 0790 10       Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality
C09 0800 10    of a Chopin Nocturne. Alfred Wallenstein, the conductor,
C09 0810  5    sensitive accompanist that he is, picked up the idea
C09 0820  7    and led the orchestra here with a sense of broodinf,
C09 0830  2    poetic mystery. The collaboration was remarkable, as
C09 0830  9    it was in both the other movements, too.
C09 0840  7    #@#
C09 0840  8    Mr. Wallenstein, who will lead all of the concerts
C09 0850  7    in the cycle, also conducted the "Leonore" Overture
C09 0860  2    No. 3 and the Fourth Symphony. The orchestra was obviously
C09 0870  3    on its mettle and it played most responsively. And
C09 0870 12    although there was plenty of vigor in the performance,
C09 0880  9    the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft
C09 0890  8    and lyrical, yet full of the suppressed tension that
C09 0900  3    is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven. Igor Oistrakh
C09 0910  1    will be the next soloist on Feb. 4.
C09 0920  1       THERE are times when one suspects that the songs
C09 0920 10    that are dropped from musical shows before they reach
C09 0930  8    Broadway may really be better than many of those that
C09 0940  7    are left in. Today, in the era of the integrated musical
C09 0950  3    when an individual song must contribute to the over-all
C09 0960  1    development of the show, it is understandable that
C09 0960  9    a song, no matter how excellent it may be on its own
C09 0970  9    terms, is cut out because it does not perform the function
C09 0980  5    required of it.
C09 0980  8       In the more casually constructed musicals of the
C09 0990  5    Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would
C09 1000  3    seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song
C09 1010  1    of merit. Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins'
C09 1010 12    "The Man I Love". Deemed too static when it was first
C09 1020 11    heard in "Lady Be Good" in Philadelphia in 1924, it
C09 1030  8    was dropped from the score. It was heard again in Philadelphia
C09 1040  7    in 1927 in the first version of "Strike Up the Band"
C09 1050  6    and again abandoned shortly before the entire show
C09 1060  3    was given up. It finally reached Broadway in the second
C09 1070  1    and successful version of "Strike Up the Band" in 1929.
C09 1070 11    (Still another song in "Strike Up the Band"- "I've
C09 1080  9    Got a Crush on You"- was retrieved from a 1928 failure,
C09 1090  9    "Treasure Girl".)
C09 1100  1    #SECOND CHANCE#
C09 1100  3    Like the Gershwins, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart
C09 1110  3    were loath to let a good song get away from them. If
C09 1110 15    one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better
C09 1120 10    fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a
C09 1130  9    Broadway failure, Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out
C09 1140  7    with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another
C09 1150  3    show.
C09 1150  4       Several of these double entries have been collected
C09 1160  2    by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney, along with Rodgers
C09 1170  1    and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route
C09 1170  9    to New York and others that reached Broadway but have
C09 1180  8    not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and
C09 1190  4    Hart repertory, in a delightfully refreshing album,
C09 1200  2    Rodgers and Hart Revisited (Spruce Records, 505 Fifth
C09 1210  1    Avenue, New York).
C09 1210  4       Among the particular gems in this collection is
C09 1220  2    the impudent opening song of "The Garrick Gaieties",
C09 1230  1    an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were
C09 1230 11    to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed;
C09 1240  9    Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions
C09 1250  6    "At the Roxy Music Hall" from "I Married an Angel";
C09 1260  5    and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers
C09 1270  3    the top-drawer Hart lyrics of "I Blush", a song that
C09 1280  4    was cut from "A Connecticut Yankee".
C09 1280 10       Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and
C09 1290  6    Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists.
C09 1300  6    Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective
C09 1310  2    orchestral accompanimen
C09 1310  4       Turning to the current musical season on Broadway,
C09 1320  5    the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals, How
C09 1330  2    to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, has been
C09 1340  3    transferred to an original cast album (R. C. A. Victor
C09 1350  1    LOC 1066; stereo LSO 1066) that has some entertaining
C09 1360  1    moments, although it is scarcely as inventive as the
C09 1360 10    praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect.
C09 1370  9    Robert Morse, singing with comically plaintive earnestness,
C09 1380  3    carries most of the burden and is responsible for the
C09 1390  3    high spots in Frank Loesser's score.
C09 1390  9       Rudy Vallee, who shares star billing with Mr. Morse,
C09 1400  9    makes only two appearances. He shares with Mr. Morse
C09 1410  7    a parody of the college anthems he once sang while
C09 1420  5    his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia
C09 1430  1    Martin, a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in
C09 1430 10    her voice. In general, Mr. Loesser has done a more
C09 1440  9    consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer.
C09 1450  6       Like Mr. Loesser, Jerry Herman is both composer
C09 1460  4    and lyriist for Milk and Honey (R. C. A. Victor LOC
C09 1470  4    1065; stereo LSO 1065), but in this case it is the
C09 1480  5    music that stands above the lyrics. For this story
C09 1480 14    of an American couple who meet and fall in love in
C09 1490 11    Israel, Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly
C09 1500  7    melodious and dance music that sparkles.
C09 1510  1    #RESOURCEFUL VOICES#
C09 1510  3    There are the full-bodied, resourceful voices of Robert
C09 1520  4    Weede, Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most
C09 1530  2    of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and, for an occasional
C09 1540  1    change of pace, the bright humor of Molly Picon. Mr.
C09 1540 11    Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from
C09 1550  8    Israel and the standard American ballad style in a
C09 1560  5    manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both
C09 1570  1    idioms.
C09 1570  2       Not content to create only the music and lyrics,
C09 1570 11    Noe^l Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail
C09 1580  9    Away (Capitol WAO 1643; stereo SWAO 1643), a saga
C09 1590  8    of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included
C09 1600 10    among Mr. Coward's more memorable works. The melodies
C09 1610  5    flow along pleasantly, as Mr. Coward's songs usually
C09 1620  3    do, but his lyrics have a tired, cut-to-a-familiar-pattern
C09 1630  1    quality. Elaine Stritch, who sings with a persuasively
C09 1640  1    warm huskiness, belts some life into most of her songs,
C09 1640 11    but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm
C09 1650  8    as Mr. Coward's songs.
C09 1660  1       WITH three fine Russian films in recent months on
C09 1660 10    World War II- "The House I Live In", "The Cranes Are
C09 1670 11    Flying" and "Ballad of a Soldier"- we had every right
C09 1680 10    to expect a real Soviet block-buster in "The Day the
C09 1690 10    War Ended". It simply isn't, not by a long shot. The
C09 1700  9    Artkino presentation, with English titles, opened on
C09 1710  4    Saturday at the Cameo Theatre.
C09 1710  9    #@#
C09 1720  1    Make no mistake, this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable
C09 1720 11    import- aptly grave, carefully written, performed and
C09 1730  4    directed. In describing the initial Allied occupation
C09 1740  2    of a middle-sized German city, the picture has color,
C09 1740 12    pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments. Told strictly
C09 1750  8    from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors, the film
C09 1760  7    compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten
C09 1770  6    Soviet couple, at both sides of the conflict's aftermath.
C09 1780  2       Unfortunately, the whole picture hinges on this
C09 1790  1    romance, at the expense of everything else. Tenderly
C09 1790  9    and rather tediously, the camera rivets on the abrupt,
C09 1800  7    deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher,
C09 1810  5    complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't
C09 1820  2    want to hurt. It's the old story, war or no war, and
C09 1820 14    more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's "Titanic",
C09 1830  8    several seasons back, when the paramount concern was
C09 1840  7    for the marital discord of a society dilettante.
C09 1850  4       Not that the picture is superficial. Under Yakov
C09 1860  2    Segal's direction, it begins stirringly, as crouching
C09 1860  9    Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other, waiting
C09 1870  9    for the first surrender gesture. One high-up camera
C09 1880  7    shot is magnificent, as the Germans straggle from a
C09 1890  4    cathedral, dotting a huge, cobblestone square, and
C09 1900  2    drop their weapons.
