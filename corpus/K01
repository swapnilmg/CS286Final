K01 0010  1    #THIRTY-THREE#
K01 0010  3    SCOTTY did not go back to school. His parents talked
K01 0020  2    seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to
K01 0020 11    a specialist at the University Hospital- Mr. McKinley
K01 0030  7    was entitled to a discount for members of his family-
K01 0040  7    and it was decided it would be best for him to take
K01 0050  6    the remainder of the term off, spend a lot of time
K01 0060  1    in bed and, for the rest, do pretty much as he chose-
K01 0060 13    provided, of course, he chose to do nothing too exciting
K01 0070  9    or too debilitating. His teacher and his school principal
K01 0080  6    were conferred with and everyone agreed that, if he
K01 0090  4    kept up with a certain amount of work at home, there
K01 0090 15    was little danger of his losing a term.
K01 0100  8       Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and
K01 0110  4    did not enter the arguments.
K01 0110  9       He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day
K01 0120  9    checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley
K01 0130  6    described as a "celebration lunch" at the cafeteria
K01 0140  4    on the campus. Rachel wore a smart hat and, because
K01 0150  1    she had been warned recently about smoking, puffed
K01 0150  9    at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained
K01 0160  7    with lipstick. Scotty's father sat sprawled in his
K01 0170  5    chair, angular, alert as a cricket, looking about at
K01 0180  2    the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with
K01 0180 11    an expression of proprietorship.
K01 0190  3       Teachers- men who wore brown suits and had gray
K01 0200  3    hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk
K01 0200 13    shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel. Rachel
K01 0210 10    was polite, Scotty indifferent. They ate the cafeteria
K01 0220  6    food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without
K01 0230  5    interest at his food, the teachers, the heroic baronial
K01 0240  2    windows, and the bright ranks of college banners. His
K01 0240 11    father tried to make the food a topic.
K01 0250  8       "The blueberry pie is good, Scotty. I recommend
K01 0260  4    it". He looked at his son, his face worried. Scotty
K01 0270  2    murmured, "No, thanks", so softly his father had to
K01 0280  1    bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round
K01 0280 12    brown ear to him. Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled
K01 0290  8    hair around it with a moment of interest. He said more
K01 0300  6    loudly, "I'm full, old Pop". He had eaten almost nothing
K01 0310  5    on the crested, three-sectioned plate and had drunk
K01 0320  3    about half the milk in its paper container.
K01 0320 11       "He's all right, Craig", Rachel said. "I can fix
K01 0330  9    him something later in the afternoon when we get home".
K01 0340  8       Since his seizure, Scotty had had little appetite;
K01 0350  5    yet his changed appearance, surprisingly, was one of
K01 0360  4    plumpness. His face was fuller; his lips and the usually
K01 0370  1    sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking.
K01 0370 10    He breathed now with his mouth open, showing a whitely
K01 0380  8    curving section of lower teeth; he kept his eyes, with
K01 0390  6    their puffed blurred lids, always lowered, though not,
K01 0400  3    apparently, focusing. Even his neck seemed thicker
K01 0400 10    and therefore shorter. His hands, which had been as
K01 0410  9    quick as a pair of fluttering birds, were now neither
K01 0420  5    active nor really relaxed. They lay on his lap, palms
K01 0430  5    up, stiffly motionless, the tapered fingers a little
K01 0440  1    thick at the joints. Altogether he had, since the seizure,
K01 0440 11    the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and
K01 0450  9    took no exercise. He looked lazy, spoiled, a little
K01 0460  5    querulous.
K01 0460  6       Rachel had little to say. She greeted her husband's
K01 0470  5    colleagues with smiling politeness, offering nothing.
K01 0480  2    Mr. McKinley, for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity,
K01 0490  1    was completely alert to his son, eyes always on the
K01 0490 11    still face, jumping to anticipate Scotty's desires.
K01 0500  7    It was a strained, silent lunch.
K01 0510  2       Rachel said, "I'd better get him to bed".
K01 0520  1       The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of
K01 0520  9    every afternoon in bed until he was stronger.
K01 0530  7       Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture, Rachel
K01 0540  5    and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth. They did
K01 0550  3    not speak much. Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums
K01 0550 13    and said softly, "Look at those stupid kids". It was
K01 0560 10    a Negro section of peeling row houses, store-front
K01 0570  7    churches and ragged children. Rachel had to bend toward
K01 0580  5    Scotty and ask him to repeat. He said, "Nothing". And
K01 0590  2    then: "There are lots of kids around here".
K01 0600  1       Scotty looked at the children, his mouth slightly
K01 0600  9    opened, his eyes dull. He felt tired and full and calm.
K01 0610  9    #THIRTY-FOUR#
K01 0610 11    THE days seemed short, perhaps because his routine
K01 0620  8    was, each day, almost the same. He rose late and went
K01 0630  8    down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast
K01 0640  3    either alone or with Rachel. Virginia treated him with
K01 0650  1    attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special
K01 0650 10    food: biscuits, cookies, candies- the result of devoted
K01 0660  7    hours in the tiled kitchen. She would hover over him
K01 0670  6    and, looking like her brother, anxiously watch the
K01 0680  3    progress of Scotty's fork or spoon.
K01 0680  9       "You don't eat enough, honey. Try to get that down".
K01 0690  9       Rachel, observing, would say, "He has to rediscover
K01 0700  7    his own capacity. It'll take time".
K01 0710  3       Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly
K01 0720  1    now, as allies who are political rather than natural
K01 0720 10    might in a war atmosphere. Both watched Scotty constantly,
K01 0730  6    Rachel without seeming to, Virginia openly, her eyes
K01 0740  6    filled with concern. Scotty was neutral. He did not
K01 0750  4    resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes tiring
K01 0760  1    sympathy. He ate what he felt like, slept as much or
K01 0760 12    as little as he pleased, and moved about the draughty
K01 0770  8    rooms of the house, when he was not in bed, with slow
K01 0780  7    dubious steps, like an elderly tourist in a cathedral.
K01 0790  2    His energy was gone. He was able, now, to sit for hours
K01 0800  1    in a chair in the living room and stare out at the
K01 0800 13    bleak yard without moving. His hands lay loosely, yet
K01 0810  7    stiffly- they were like wax hands: almost lifelike,
K01 0820  3    not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung slightly
K01 0830  2    open. When he was asked a question or addressed in
K01 0830 12    such a way that some response was inescapable, he would
K01 0840  8    answer; if, as often happened, he had to repeat because
K01 0850  7    he had spoken too softly, he would repeat his words
K01 0860  4    in the same way, without emphasis or impatience, only
K01 0870  1    a little louder.
K01 0870  4       He had not mentioned Kate. He had not even thought
K01 0880  2    about her much except once or twice at night in bed
K01 0880 13    when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly, almost
K01 0890  7    accidentally, encounter her. At these times he felt
K01 0900  7    a kind of pain in his upper chest, but it was an objective
K01 0910  5    pain, in no way different from others in intensity
K01 0920  1    and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged
K01 0920 11    wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed;
K01 0930  7    it was merely another part of his weakness. He was
K01 0940  6    calm, drugged, and lazy. He did not care.
K01 0950  1       Rachel mentioned Kate. She said, "I notice the girl
K01 0950 10    from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or
K01 0960  9    visit".
K01 0960 10       Scotty said, "That's all right. Kate's all right".
K01 0970  8    He thought about it briefly, then deliberately turned
K01 0980  7    the talk to something else.
K01 0990  1       Once, sitting at the front window in his parents'
K01 0990 10    room, he saw Kate come out of her house. She was with
K01 1000 11    Elizabeth. They were far off and looked tiny. The heavy
K01 1010  8    branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal
K01 1020  4    them. They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps and
K01 1030  2    moved off in the direction of the park. He thought
K01 1030 12    he saw- it awakened and, for a moment, interested him-
K01 1040  8    that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a
K01 1050  8    round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash. Then
K01 1060  2    they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his
K01 1060 12    own room and got into bed. By the time he was under
K01 1070 12    the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate.
K01 1080  4       The doctor, since Scotty was no longer allowed to
K01 1090  3    make his regular trips into town to see him, came often
K01 1100  1    and informally to the house. He would sit, slim-waisted
K01 1100 11    and spare, on the edge of Scotty's bed, his legs crossed
K01 1110 10    so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the
K01 1120  6    floor. Scotty did not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing
K01 1130  3    as he used to.
K01 1130  7       "Husky young man", he said with mock distaste. "I
K01 1140  6    imagine you're always battling in school".
K01 1150  1       "I don't go to school any more".
K01 1150  8       "Pardon"? The doctor had to bend close to hear;
K01 1160  9    his delicate hand, as veined as a moth's wing, rested
K01 1170  7    absently on Scotty's chest. Scotty said the same words
K01 1180  5    more loudly. "Oh. Well, we're taking a little vacation,
K01 1190  3    that's all". He turned unsmilingly to Rachel. "I think
K01 1200  2    by the end of next week he could get out in the air
K01 1200 15    a little. He could now but the weakness is very definite;
K01 1210 10    it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily. He'll
K01 1220  6    be stronger soon". His stethoscope was on the table
K01 1230  5    by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at
K01 1240  3    Scotty. He said fussily, "Just keep the cap on those
K01 1250  1    strong emotions". The stethoscope glinted silver in
K01 1250  8    the darkening room. "I'll drop by again in a few days".
K01 1260  9       Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone. She
K01 1270  8    smoothed the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things
K01 1280  5    up from the floor. She did not touch him. Scotty watched
K01 1290  2    with disinterest. He did not speak. He had no desire
K01 1290 12    to.
K01 1300  1       She said, "Do you think you'll miss school"?
K01 1310  1       He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel
K01 1310  9    had grown. He did not care. He felt her irritability
K01 1320  7    did not concern him, yet he knew he would not care
K01 1330  5    even if it did. He shook his head.
K01 1330 13       "We've had any number of calls about you. You could
K01 1340 10    win a popularity contest at that school without any
K01 1350  6    trouble. Miss Estherson called twice. She wants to
K01 1360  4    pay you a visit. She says the children miss you. Apparently
K01 1370  1    you were the light of their lives".
K01 1370  8       Scotty shrugged slightly. Rachel came close to the
K01 1380  7    bed, bent as if she would kiss him, then moved away.
K01 1390  4    She was frowning. "That doctor annoys me". She seemed
K01 1400  2    to speak to herself. "Do you suppose his self-consciousness
K01 1410  1    is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or
K01 1410  9    merely of doctors in general"?
K01 1420  3       She turned to him again. "Well, Mrs. Charles- Sally-
K01 1430  1    has phoned too. She was very worried". Rachel's tone
K01 1440  2    was dry. "She didn't really say"- She glanced away
K01 1450  2    at the floor, then swooped gracefully and picked up
K01 1450 11    one of Scotty's slippers. "I mean, do you feel like
K01 1460  8    seeing Kate"?
K01 1470  1       Scotty said, "I don't know". It was true. He did
K01 1470 11    not. There was the slight pain, but it was no different
K01 1480 10    from the throbbing in his head.
K01 1490  3       "Well, there's time, in any case. We'll wait till
K01 1500  2    you're stronger and then talk about it". She put the
K01 1500 12    slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed.
K01 1520 10       Scotty said, "Okay".
K01 1530  1       This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead.
K01 1530 10    Scotty was pleased.
K01 1540  3       His father was a constant visitor. Scotty would
K01 1550  2    hear the front door in the evening and then his father's
K01 1550 13    deep slow voice; it floated up the stairs.
K01 1560  8       "How's Scotty"?
K01 1570  1       And Rachel's or Virginia's reply: "Better. He's
K01 1580  1    getting plenty of rest".
K01 1580  5       "Is his appetite improved"? Or: "Does he get exercise"?
K01 1590  6       The exchange was almost invariable, and Scotty,
K01 1600  4    in his bed, could hear every word of it. He never smiled.
K01 1610  3    It required an energy he no longer possessed to be
K01 1610 13    satirical about his father. His father would come upstairs
K01 1620  9    and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and
K01 1630  8    look at his son. After a pause, during which he studied
K01 1640  5    Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could
K01 1650  3    not study him too, Mr. McKinley would ask the same
K01 1670  1    questions he had asked downstairs.
K01 1670  6       Scotty would reply softly and his father, apologetically,
K01 1680  4    would ask him to repeat.
K01 1680  9       "I'm eating more", he would say. Or: "I walk around
K01 1690 10    the house a lot".
K01 1700  2       "Perhaps you should get out a little".
K01 1700  9       "I'm not supposed to yet". He was not irritated.
K01 1710  9    He did not mind the useless, kindly questions. He looked
K01 1720  7    at the lined face with vague interest; he felt he was
K01 1730  6    noting it, as if it were something he might think about
K01 1740  3    when he grew stronger.
K01 1740  7       Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care,
K01 1750  5    seeking something material to blame for his son's illness.
K01 1760  4       "Have you got enough blankets"? And another time,
K01 1770  3    without accusation: "You never wore that scarf I bought
K01 1780  3    you".
