J45 0010  1    #A. REASONS FOR SELECTING MAIL QUESTIONNAIRE METHOD#
J45 0010  8    There were two methods that could have been used for
J45 0020  8    conducting the study within the resources available:
J45 0030  3    (1) interviews in depth with a few selected companies,
J45 0040  2    and (2) the more limited interrogation of a large number
J45 0040 12    of companies by means of a mail questionnaire.
J45 0050  8       While the method of interviewing a small number
J45 0060  6    of companies was appealing because of the opportunity
J45 0070  2    it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons
J45 0070 11    and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions,
J45 0080  8    it also involved the risk of paying undue attention
J45 0090  7    to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual
J45 0100  6    companies. As a result, it was decided that a mail
J45 0110  3    questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would
J45 0110 12    be more effective in determining the general practices
J45 0120  7    and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some
J45 0140  6    of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense
J45 0150  3    procurement that concern both industry and government.
J45 0160  1    It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire
J45 0160 11    would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made
J45 0170  7    in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature.
J45 0180  3       It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent
J45 0190  3    limitations. There is the danger that the questions
J45 0190 11    will mean different things to different respondents.
J45 0200  7    Simple "yes" or "no" answers do not reveal the different
J45 0210  8    shades of opinion that the various respondents may
J45 0220  4    have. A respondent may want to make alternative answers
J45 0230  2    because he does not know the precise circumstances
J45 0230 10    assumed in the question. There is also the problem
J45 0240  9    of the respondent's frame of reference. Is the respondent
J45 0250  6    making a recommendation for his own benefit, for the
J45 0260  4    benefit of his industry, for the benefit of a specific
J45 0270  1    government department or service, for the benefit of
J45 0270  9    the defense program, for the benefit of small business,
J45 0280  8    or for the benefit of the taxpayers?
J45 0290  2       There is also the question of whether the respondent
J45 0300  1    based his answers on factual information and carefully
J45 0300  9    considered judgment, or whether his answers were casual
J45 0310  8    guesses. Finally, there is the question of how strongly
J45 0320  7    an expressed opinion is held- whether it is a firm
J45 0330  5    opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly
J45 0340  1    over the alternatives.
J45 0340  4       The research team was very mindful of these dangers
J45 0350  3    and limitations of a mail questionnaire. Under the
J45 0350 11    circumstances, however, the team considered it would
J45 0360  7    provide the most useful information at this point.
J45 0370  5    In the preparation of the questionnaire the problems
J45 0380  3    noted above were carefully considered, and the structure
J45 0390  1    and phraseology used were designed to minimize the
J45 0390  9    effects of these limitations.
J45 0400  2    #B. DESIGN OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE#
J45 0400  7    The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types
J45 0410  6    of information: (1) the facts regarding certain characteristics
J45 0420  3    of the respondents, including their experience with,
J45 0430  2    and interest in, securing defense business; (2) the
J45 0430 10    actual selling and buying practices of the respondents;
J45 0440  8    and (3) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents
J45 0450  6    concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding
J45 0460  5    defense contracts. It was hoped that the facts concerning
J45 0470  2    the characteristics and practices of the respondents
J45 0470  9    would offer clues to the reasons why they took the
J45 0480 10    positions and made the recommendations which they did.
J45 0490  5       The major sections of the questionnaire (see Appendix
J45 0500  3    B) are devoted to the following:
J45 0510  1    _1._
J45 0520  1       Information for classifying respondents (Part A
J45 0520  7    of the questionnaire)
J45 0530  1    _2._
J45 0530  2       Characteristics of defense sales activities (Part
J45 0530  8    B of the questionnaire)
J45 0540  4    _3._
J45 0540  5       Respondents' practices in participating in advertised
J45 0550  3    bidding for defense business (Part C of the questionnaire)
J45 0560  2    _4._
J45 0560  3       Respondents' practices in participating in negotiated
J45 0570  2    bidding for defense purposes (Part D of the questionnaire)
J45 0580  1    _5._
J45 0580  2       Respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding
J45 0590  1    (Part E of the questionnaire)
J45 0590  6    _6._
J45 0590  7       Respondents' opinions regarding negotiated bidding
J45 0600  3    (Part F of the questionnaire)
J45 0610  1    _7._
J45 0610  1       Respondents' preferences regarding the methods of
J45 0610  7    awarding defense contracts (Part G of the questionnaire)
J45 0620  7       The questionnaire provided a place for the name
J45 0630  7    of the respondent but stated that identification of
J45 0640  2    the respondent was optional. The questionnaire also
J45 0640  9    stated that, in any event, all replies would be treated
J45 0650 10    confidentially. It is interesting to note that 75 per
J45 0660  9    cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified
J45 0670  3    themselves.
J45 0670  4    #C. PREPARATION AND PRETEST OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE#
J45 0690  1    The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire
J45 0700  1    over a period of six months. In June, 1960, an early
J45 0700 12    draft of the questionnaire, along with a cover letter,
J45 0710  9    was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington.
J45 0720  7    Several days after the companies had received the questionnaire,
J45 0730  5    members of the research team contacted the presidents
J45 0740  3    of eleven of these companies in person or by phone
J45 0750  1    to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees
J45 0750  9    might have experienced in completing the questionnaire.
J45 0760  6    This test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire.
J45 0770  6       The research team was concerned that responses from
J45 0780  5    firms in the state of Washington might not be typical
J45 0790  4    of those throughout the country, or that the results
J45 0790 13    might be different when no phone or personal follow-up
J45 0800 10    was made. Accordingly, another test of the questionaire
J45 0810  6    was made. The revised draft was mailed in July, 1960,
J45 0820  6    to 100 firms throughout the United States. Fifty of
J45 0830  3    the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from
J45 0830 13    3,500 names submitted by member companies of the Aerospace
J45 0840  8    Industries Association (AIA list) and fifty were selected
J45 0850  7    in a similar manner from a list of 1,500 names compiled
J45 0860  7    by the research team from the Thomas Register (TR
J45 0870  3    list). The method of compiling the AIA and TR lists
J45 0880  3    will be described later.
J45 0880  7       Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed, follow-up
J45 0890  5    airmail postcards were sent urging those companies
J45 0900  3    which had not yet returned their questionnaires to
J45 0900 11    do so at once. Twenty-eight returns in all were received.
J45 0910 11    The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors
J45 0920  7    in the answers or for questions that were apparently
J45 0930  4    not understood by the respondent. The cover letter,
J45 0940  2    questionnaire, and follow-up postcard were then revised
J45 0940 10    into final form (see Appendixes A, B, and C.
J45 0950  9    #D. COMPILATION OF MAILING LISTS#
J45 0960  4    The objective of the study was to determine the opinions
J45 0970  2    and practices of small firms selling to defense programs.
J45 0970 11    The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected
J45 0980  8    with this objective in mind.
J45 0990  3       Three lists of companies were made and used in the
J45 1000  1    study.
J45 1000  2       The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies
J45 1010  1    located in the state of Washington which were personally
J45 1010 10    known to the research team to be active in defense
J45 1020  9    work. The primary consideration in the compilation
J45 1030  4    of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire
J45 1040  2    with company officers.
J45 1040  5       The second list was derived from a group of approximately
J45 1050  6    8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace
J45 1060  5    Industries Association. These names were secured from
J45 1070  2    member companies by the Association from the forty-four
J45 1070 11    sources listed in Appendix F. Each source selected
J45 1080  8    from its approved bidders list about 200 firms which
J45 1090  7    it believed to be small businesses that participated
J45 1100  3    in the production of weapons and weapon support systems.
J45 1110  1    Where possible, the name of an executive was supplied
J45 1110 10    along with the company name and address.
J45 1120  6       The forty-four lists supplied by the AIA member
J45 1130  5    companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated.
J45 1140  2    There was further elimination of all companies that
J45 1140 10    were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company
J45 1150 10    executive. The remaining names were then checked against
J45 1160  7    the Thomas Register list (see below) and duplicate
J45 1170  5    names were removed from the AIA lists. By these steps
J45 1180  4    the final AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500.
J45 1190  1       The third list was selected by the research team
J45 1190 10    on a random basis from the Thomas Register. It was
J45 1200  8    compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions
J45 1210  6    and practices of companies on the lists submitted by
J45 1220  3    the members of the Aerospace industries Association
J45 1230  1    were materially different from those of other small
J45 1230  9    firms selling to defense programs. Such a difference
J45 1240  5    might have resulted from:
J45 1250  1    _1._
J45 1250  1       The fact that the Aerospace Industries Association
J45 1250  8    members whose lists were used did not comprise all
J45 1260  8    firms engaged in defense programs.
J45 1270  1    _2._
J45 1270  2       The fact that companies on the AIA lists were already
J45 1280  1    participating in the defense program because of the
J45 1280  9    manner of their selection. Accordingly, as "in-group",
J45 1290  6    they might have different opinions and practices than
J45 1300  4    an "out-group" composed of those companies not so participating
J45 1310  4    but interested in defense business.
J45 1310  9    _3._
J45 1320  1       The fact that AIA lists might not have been selected
J45 1320 10    on a random basis.
J45 1330  2       The control sample was selected by taking the bottom
J45 1340  1    name of each of the two columns of names on each page
J45 1340 13    of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the
J45 1350  6    Thomas Register. If the bottom name in each column
J45 1360  5    did not have a responsible executive identified, the
J45 1370  2    next name above which identified such a responsible
J45 1370 10    executive was substituted. Fifteen hundred names were
J45 1380  6    selected in this fashion.
J45 1380 10    #E. MAILING THE QUESTIONNAIRE#
J45 1390  4    Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed
J45 1400  4    personally to the president or other executive of each
J45 1410  3    firm. The questionnaires were mailed in Seattle, Washington,
J45 1420  1    and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states
J45 1420 11    of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Airmail
J45 1430  5    was used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest.
J45 1440  4       Each letter contained a postage-prepaid return envelope
J45 1450  3    by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific Northwest,
J45 1460  2    and by airmail for those outside the Pacific Northwest.
J45 1470  1    Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was
J45 1470  8    mailed, a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each
J45 1490  7    of the original names.
J45 1490 11       The first test mailing (to 14 companies) was made
J45 1500  9    in June, 1960. The second test mailing (to 100 companies)
J45 1510  6    was made in July, 1960. The final mailing of the questionnaire
J45 1520  5    was made late in August, 1960, to 4,900 firms consisting
J45 1530  3    of 3,450 from the AIA list and 1,450 from the TR
J45 1531  2    list.
J45 1531  3    #F. RETURNS RECEIVED#
J45 1540  3    Over 1,000 returns were received within two weeks after
J45 1550  5    the final mailing was made. They continued to arrive
J45 1560  3    until the end of December, 1960, by which time a total
J45 1560 14    of 1,343 returns were received representing 26.8 per
J45 1570  8    cent of the 5,014 questionnaires sent out. Fifty-seven
J45 1580  5    returns could not be used because they were incomplete
J45 1590  4    or received too late to be processed. The remaining
J45 1600  1    1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories
J45 1600 10    in Table 2.
J45 1610  2    #G. PROCESSING THE RETURNS#
J45 1610  6    Each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes
J45 1620  4    and for comments, and was identified by a serial number,
J45 1630  2    by the source list from which the company name was
J45 1630 12    selected, and by the geographical location of the company
J45 1640  9    as determined by the postmark on the return envelope.
J45 1650  5    All responses, except comments, were numerically coded
J45 1660  3    to permit use of data-processing equipment. The codes
J45 1661  1    were key-punched into IBM punch cards and verified.
J45 1670  7    Each return required three cards and involved key punching
J45 1680  8    228 digital columns. In order to be able to properly
J45 1690  8    relate the data for a single company each of the three
J45 1700  5    cards comprising the set for each firm was identified
J45 1710  1    with the appropriate serial number of the respondent.
J45 1710  9    The cards were then processed using standard IBM punch
J45 1720  7    card equipment, including an IBM 650 computer.
J45 1730  5       The first step in processing was to analyze the
J45 1740  4    returns from Questions 1, 2, and 3 to determine whether
J45 1750  2    the respondents were large businesses or small businesses,
J45 1750 10    in accordance with the definitions contained in ASPR
J45 1760  8    Section 1-701. (see Chapter II). The results are shown
J45 1770  8    in Table 3.
J45 1780  1       The returns from companies classified as large businesses
J45 1780  9    were set aside and not used because they were not relevant
J45 1790  9    to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms.
J45 1800  6       The second step in processing was to compare the
J45 1810  5    responses from companies on the AIA list with those
J45 1820  2    from companies on the TR list in order to determine
J45 1820 12    whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses
J45 1830  9    for the purposes of the study. The methods and results
J45 1840  7    of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix
J45 1850  4    H. It was concluded that it would be appropriate to
J45 1860  2    process the two groups of responses as a single sample
J45 1860 12    of all small businesses engaged in, or wishing to sell
J45 1870  9    to, defense programs. In the first place, the two groups
J45 1880  8    of firms, when combined, had characteristics and practices
J45 1890  3    that were more representative of companies that were
J45 1900  3    the subject of this study than did the firms from the
J45 1900 14    AIA list alone.
