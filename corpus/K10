K10 0010  1       That summer the gambling houses were closed, despite
K10 0010  9    the threats of Pierre Ameaux, a gaming-card manufacturer.
K10 0020  8    Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets. The
K10 0030  6    Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied.
K10 0040  3    The slit breeches had to go. Drunkenness was no longer
K10 0050  2    tolerated. In defiance, a chinless reprobate, Jake
K10 0050  9    Camaret, marched down the aisle in St. Peter's one
K10 0060  9    Sunday morning, followed by one of the women from the
K10 0070  8    Bordel, whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack
K10 0080  4    of any shame. Plunking themselves down on the front
K10 0090  1    bench, they turned to smirk at those around them.
K10 0090 10       John's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy.
K10 0100  7    But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity
K10 0110  7    used to tell them about Him. Calmly he opened the Bible
K10 0120  5    and read of the woman at the well. He finished the
K10 0130  2    worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt
K10 0130 12    to dishonor God and man.
K10 0140  4       The next morning, as the clock struck nine, he appeared
K10 0150  3    at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted
K10 0160  1    that the couple would have to be punished if the Church
K10 0160 12    was to be respected.
K10 0170  1       "I have told you before, and I tell you again",
K10 0170 11    Monsieur Favre said rudely. "Stick to the preaching
K10 0180  8    of the Gospel"!
K10 0190  1       John stiffened in anger. "That is the answer the
K10 0190 10    ungodly will always make when the Church points its
K10 0200  9    fingers at their sins. I say to you that the Church
K10 0210  8    will ever decry evil"!
K10 0210 12       John's reply was like a declaration of war. Monsieur
K10 0220  9    Favre sat down in his high-backed stall, lips compressed,
K10 0230  8    eyes glinting. Ablard Corne, a short man with a rotunda
K10 0240  7    of stomach, rose. Every eye was on him as he began
K10 0250  4    to speak.
K10 0250  6       "What Master Calvin says is true. How can we have
K10 0260  5    a good city unless we respect morality"?
K10 0270  1       Abel Poupin, a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set
K10 0270 11    eyes, got to his feet. "We all know that Jake Camaret
K10 0280  9    and the woman are brazenly living together. It would
K10 0290  5    be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers".
K10 0300  3       Philibert Berthelier, the son of the famous patriot,
K10 0310  2    disagreed. "Do not listen to that Frenchman. He is
K10 0310 11    throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win"!
K10 0320 10       John was quietly insistent. "There can be no compromise
K10 0330  9    when souls are in jeopardy".
K10 0340  3       A week later the sentence of the Council was carried
K10 0350  2    out: Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked
K10 0350 11    through the streets past a mocking populace. Before
K10 0360  8    them stalked the beadle, proclaiming as he went, "Thus
K10 0370  6    the Council deals with those who break its laws- adulterers,
K10 0380  4    thieves, murderers, and lewd persons. Let evildoers
K10 0390  2    contemplate their ways, and let every man beware"!
K10 0390 10    ##
K10 0400  1    John's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he
K10 0400 10    read the letter he had just received from his sister
K10 0410  8    Mary. Charles had died two weeks before, in early November,
K10 0420  6    without being reconciled to the Church. The canons,
K10 0430  3    in a body, had tried to force him on his deathbed to
K10 0440  1    let them give him the last rites of the Church, but
K10 0440 12    he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith. Burial
K10 0450  6    had taken place at night in the ground at the public
K10 0460  6    crossroads under the gibbet, so that his enemies could
K10 0470  2    not find his body and have it dug up and burned. The
K10 0470 14    Abbot of St. Eloi, Claude de Mommor, had been a good
K10 0480 11    friend, but not even he thought Charles deserved burial
K10 0490  7    in hallowed ground.
K10 0500  1       John closed his eyes and saw once again the little
K10 0500 10    niche in his mother's bedroom, where she had knelt
K10 0510  6    to tell the good Virgin of her needs. The blue-draped
K10 0520  4    Virgin was still there, but no one knelt before her
K10 0530  1    now. Not even Varnessa; she, too, prayed only to God.
K10 0530 11    For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells
K10 0540 10    of Noyon-la-Sainte, the touch of his mother's hand,
K10 0550  7    the lilt of Charles's voice in the square raftered
K10 0560  3    rooms, his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons,
K10 0570  1    and the sight of the beloved bishop. But he had to
K10 0570 12    follow the light. Unless God expected a man to believe
K10 0580  8    the Holy Scriptures, why had He given them to him?
K10 0590  7    ##
K10 0590  8    The white-clad trees stood like specters in the February
K10 0600  5    night. Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting
K10 0610  3    rooftops, as John trudged toward St. Peter's. A carriage
K10 0620  1    crunched by, its dim lights filtering through the gloom.
K10 0620 10    The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like
K10 0630 11    ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes,
K10 0640  6    his only ones, now patched with folded parchment. The
K10 0650  2    city had recently given him a small salary, but it
K10 0650 12    was not enough to supply even necessities.
K10 0660  6       As he neared the square, a round figure muffled
K10 0670  4    in a long, black cape whisked by. John recognized Ablard
K10 0680  2    Corne and called out a greeting. How grateful he was
K10 0680 12    to such men! There were several on the Council who
K10 0690  9    tried to live like Christians. Despite their efforts,
K10 0700  4    the problems seemed to grow graver all the time. Quickening
K10 0710  5    his steps, John entered the vast church and climbed
K10 0720  2    the tower steps to the bells. Underneath the big one,
K10 0720 12    in the silent moonlight, lay a dead pigeon, and on
K10 0730  9    the smaller bell, the Clemence, two gray and white
K10 0740  5    birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air.
K10 0750  3       John leaned upon the stone balustrade. He brushed
K10 0760  1    back his black hair, shoving it under his pastor's
K10 0760 10    cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes. Below the
K10 0770  8    moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white
K10 0780  4    peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars.
K10 0790  3    He stood very still, his arms at his sides, staring
K10 0790 13    up at the heavens, then down at the blinking lights
K10 0800 10    below.
K10 0800 11       "How long, my Lord? How long? I have never asked
K10 0810 10    for an easy task, but I am weary of the strife".
K10 0820  8       Sleep was difficult these days. Indigestion plagued
K10 0830  3    him. Severe headaches were frequent. Loneliness tore
K10 0840  2    through him like a physical pain whenever he thought
K10 0840 11    of Peter Robert, Nerien, Nicholas Cop, Martin Bucer,
K10 0850  7    and even the compromising Louis du Tillet. An occasional
K10 0860  6    traveler from Italy brought news of Peter Robert, who
K10 0870  6    was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian
K10 0880  2    peasants. Letters came regularly from Nerien, Nicholas,
K10 0890  1    and Martin. He had Anthony and William to confide in
K10 0890 11    and consult. But William continued to find a bitter
K10 0900  8    joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred
K10 0910  5    to the Old Church. John found it difficult, but he
K10 0920  3    held him in check. And Anthony was busy most of the
K10 0920 14    time courting this girl and that. His easy good looks
K10 0930 10    made him a favorite with the ladies.
K10 0940  4       Geneva, instead of becoming the City of God, as
K10 0950  2    John had dreamed, had in the two years since he had
K10 0950 13    been there, continued to be a godless place where all
K10 0960  9    manner of vice flourished. Refugees poured in, signing
K10 0970  5    the Confession and rules in order to remain, and then
K10 0980  3    disregarding them. Dice rolled, prostitutes plied their
K10 0990  1    trade, thieves stole, murderers stabbed, and the ungodly
K10 0990  9    blasphemed. Catholics who were truly Christians longed
K10 1000  7    for the simple penance of days gone by. Libertines
K10 1010  5    recalled the heroism of the past and demanded: "Are
K10 1020  2    we going to allow the Protestant Pope, Master Calvin,
K10 1030  1    to curtail our liberty? ... Why, oh why, doesn't he
K10 1030 11    stick to preaching the Gospel, instead of meddling
K10 1040  6    in civic affairs, politics, economics, and social issues
K10 1050  5    that are no concern of the Church"? And John's reply
K10 1060  4    was always the same: "Anything that affects souls is
K10 1070  3    the concern of the Church! We will have righteousness"!
K10 1080  1       Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated
K10 1080 11    tonight. Unless the confusion cleared, he would not
K10 1090  8    be coming here much longer. Monsieur Favre's threat
K10 1100  5    would become a reality, for he continued to proclaim
K10 1110  3    loudly that the city must rid itself of "that Frenchman".
K10 1120  1       The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming
K10 1130  1    up to the tower interrupted his reverie. Faint at first,
K10 1130 11    the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the
K10 1140  8    wind. Eli Corault! John thought. What is he doing here
K10 1150  7    at this hour? He started down the steps to meet the
K10 1160  5    near-blind preacher, who had been one of the early
K10 1160 15    Gospelers in Paris.
K10 1170  3       "John? Is that you? I came to warn you of a plot"!
K10 1180  5       John stood above him, his face ashen. What now?
K10 1190  2    Slowly, like a man grown old, he took Eli's hand and
K10 1190 13    led him below to the tower study, guiding him to a
K10 1200 11    chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned.
K10 1210  7       "Plot"? John asked tiredly.
K10 1220  2       "Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit. I went to
K10 1230  1    your rooms, and Anthony told me you were here. Two
K10 1230 11    Anabaptists, Caroli and Benoit, are to challenge you
K10 1240  7    and William to a debate before the Council. It is to
K10 1250  6    be a trap. You know the law: if you lose the debate
K10 1260  2    after accepting a challenge, you will be banished"!
K10 1270  1       "What will be the subject"?
K10 1270  6       "You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the
K10 1280  6    religious who remain loyal".
K10 1280 10       Anger and fear fused in John. Ever since the fourth
K10 1290 10    century a controversy had raged over the person of
K10 1300  7    Christ. Those who refused to believe that He was the
K10 1310  5    eternal Son of God were termed Arianists. Peter Caroli
K10 1320  2    had come to Geneva, saying that he had been a bishop
K10 1320 13    of the Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris
K10 1330 10    for his Reformed faith. He asked to be appointed a
K10 1340  7    preacher. But Michael Sept had unmasked him, revealing
K10 1350  3    he had never been a bishop, but was an Anabaptist,
K10 1360  1    afraid to state his faith, because he knew John Calvin
K10 1360 11    had written a book against their belief that the soul
K10 1370  9    slept after death. So John had refused to agree to
K10 1380  6    his appointment as a preacher, and now Caroli sought
K10 1390  2    revenge.
K10 1390  3       John sighed. "If William agrees, we should insist
K10 1400  2    on a public debate", he said at length.
K10 1400 10       "There is more to the conspiracy. Bern demands that
K10 1410  9    the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to
K10 1420  7    be, with unleavened bread. Furthermore, Bern decrees
K10 1430  3    that we must do as we are ordered by the Council, preach
K10 1440  2    only the word of God and stop meddling in politics"!
K10 1450  1       "It was always the spirit with Christ; matters such
K10 1450 10    as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential.
K10 1460  6    Geneva must remain a sovereign state. We will not yield
K10 1470  6    to the demands of Bern"!
K10 1470 11       The firelight played over Eli's flowing white locks
K10 1480  8    and rugged features. "Monsieur Favre indicated that
K10 1490  5    if I would co-operate, after you and William are banished,
K10 1500  5    following the debate, I will be given a place of influence".
K10 1510  4       "What was your reply to that"?
K10 1520  1       "That I would rather be banished with two such Christians
K10 1520 11    than be made the Chief Syndic"!
K10 1530  6    ##
K10 1530  7    The following morning, as John entered the Place Molard
K10 1540  6    on his way to visit a sick refugee, he had a premonition
K10 1550  5    of danger. Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled
K10 1560  2    him. He wanted to run, but he knew that if he did,
K10 1560 14    he would be lost. He stood very still, his heart thumping
K10 1570 10    wildly. On the outskirts of the rabble the Camaret
K10 1580  6    brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their fists.
K10 1590  2       "Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern"?
K10 1600  1    the chinless Jake called.
K10 1600  5       "Arianist"! a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared.
K10 1610  8    "Heretic"!
K10 1610  9       John lifted his hand for silence. "Know this: the
K10 1620  8    ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern". His
K10 1630  6    voice shook a little.
K10 1630 10       Somebody heaved a stone. For an instant John was
K10 1640  9    stunned.
K10 1640 10       When he felt the side of his head, his fingers came
K10 1650  9    away covered with blood. Before he could duck, another
K10 1660  5    stone struck him. And another.
K10 1660 10       "Let him be now"! Pierre Ameaux, the gaming-card
K10 1670  9    manufacturer said, his little pig eyes glaring. "We
K10 1680  7    have taught him a lesson".
K10 1690  1       The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down
K10 1690 10    the hill. Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward.
K10 1700  7    Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees
K10 1710  7    in the melting snow. At once a bevy of dogs was snapping
K10 1720  3    and snarling around him. One, more horrible than the
K10 1730  1    rest, lunged, growling deep in his throat, his hair
K10 1730 10    bristling. With great difficulty John clambered to
K10 1740  5    his feet and started to run, sweat pouring down his
K10 1750  4    face.
