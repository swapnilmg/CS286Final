J08 0010  1    #BIOLOGICAL WARFARE#
J08 0010  3    Biological warfare is the intentional use of living
J08 0020  2    microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose
J08 0020 10    of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness
J08 0030  6    of man. It is the exploitation of the inherent potential
J08 0040  5    of infectious disease agents by scientific research
J08 0050  2    and development, resulting in the production of BW
J08 0060  1    weapons systems. Man may also be injured secondarily
J08 0060  9    by damage to his food crops or domestic animals.
J08 0070  7       Biological warfare is considered to be primarily
J08 0080  4    a strategic weapon. The major reason for this is that
J08 0090  3    it has no quick-kill effect. The incubation period
J08 0090 12    of infectious disease, plus a variable period of illness
J08 0100  8    even before a lethal effect, render this weapon unsuitable
J08 0110  5    for hand-to-hand encounter. A man can be an effective
J08 0130  5    fighting machine throughout the incubation period of
J08 0140  2    most infectious diseases. Thus, an enemy would probably
J08 0140 10    use this weapon for attack on static population centers
J08 0150  7    such as large cities.
J08 0160  1       An important operational procedure in BW for an
J08 0160  9    enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent
J08 0170 10    over the target area. This concept has stimulated much
J08 0180  5    basic research concerning the behavior of particulate
J08 0190  2    biological materials, the pathogenesis of respiratory
J08 0190  8    infections, the medical management of such diseases
J08 0200  7    and defense against their occurrence.
J08 0210  2       The biological and physical properties of infectious
J08 0220  1    particles have been studied intensively during the
J08 0220  8    past fifteen years. Much new equipment and many unique
J08 0230  8    techniques have been developed for the quantitative
J08 0240  4    exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious
J08 0250  3    agents contained in particles of specified dimensional
J08 0260  1    characteristics. Much information has been gathered
J08 0260  7    relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques.
J08 0270  5    Much of the older experimental work on respiratory
J08 0280  4    infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures.
J08 0290  2    The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of
J08 0290 10    infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different
J08 0300  9    from exposure, through natural respiration, to aerosolized
J08 0310  6    organisms.
J08 0310  7       The importance of particle size in such aerosols
J08 0320  8    has been thoroughly demonstrated. The natural anatomical
J08 0330  4    and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory
J08 0340  5    tract, such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia
J08 0350  3    of the trachea and larger bronchi, are capable of impinging
J08 0360  1    out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily
J08 0360 10    exposed in our daily existence. Very small particles,
J08 0370  5    however, in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter
J08 0380  5    are capable of passing these impinging barriers and
J08 0390  2    entering the alveolar bed of the lungs. This area is
J08 0390 12    highly susceptible to infection. The entrance and retention
J08 0400  7    of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost
J08 0410  6    to an intratissue inoculation. The relationship between
J08 0420  3    particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in
J08 0430  2    Table 1.
J08 0430  4       In considering BW defense, it must be recognized
J08 0440  1    that a number of critical meterological parameters
J08 0440  8    must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect.
J08 0450  7    For example, bright sunlight is rapidly destructive
J08 0460  4    for living microorganisms suspended in air. There are
J08 0470  2    optimal humidity requirements for various agents when
J08 0470  9    airborne. Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions
J08 0480  6    are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface.
J08 0490  7    It will rise during lapse conditions. There are, of
J08 0500  4    course, certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle
J08 0510  1    when most of these conditions will be met.
J08 0510  9       Certain other properties of small particles, in
J08 0520  5    addition to those already mentioned in connection with
J08 0530  3    penetration of the respiratory tract, are noteworthy
J08 0540  1    in defense considerations. The smaller the particle
J08 0540  8    the further it will travel downwind before settling
J08 0550  5    out. An aerosol of such small particles. moreover,
J08 0560  2    diffuses through structures in much the same manner
J08 0560 10    as a gas. There may be a number of secondary effects
J08 0570 11    resulting from diffusion through buildings such as
J08 0580  5    widespread contamination of kitchens, restaurants,
J08 0590  2    food stores, hospitals, etc. Depending on the organism,
J08 0600  1    there may be multiplication in some food or beverage
J08 0600 10    products, i.e., in milk for example. The secondary
J08 0610  7    consequences from this could be very serious and must
J08 0620  6    be taken into consideration in planning for defense.
J08 0630  2       Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles
J08 0640  1    can be illustrated by the following field trials:
J08 0640  9       In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated
J08 0650  8    from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under
J08 0660  7    appropriately selected meteorological conditions. Zinc
J08 0670  3    cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were
J08 0680  1    disseminated. This material fluoresces under ultraviolet
J08 0680  7    light which facilitates its sampling and assessment.
J08 0690  6    Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while
J08 0700  4    the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles.
J08 0710  2       Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this
J08 0710 10    trial. The particles traveled a maximum detected distance
J08 0720  8    of some 450 miles. From these dosage isopleths it can
J08 0730  7    be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was
J08 0740  4    covered. These dosages could have been increased by
J08 0750  2    increasing the source strength which was small in this
J08 0750 11    case.
J08 0760  1       The behavior of a biological aerosol, on a much
J08 0760  9    smaller scale, is illustrated by a specific field trial
J08 0770  6    conducted with a non-pathogenic organism. An aqueous
J08 0780  3    suspension of the spores of B. subtilis, var. niger,
J08 0790  2    generally known as Bacillus globigii, was aerosolized
J08 0800  1    using commercially available nozzles. A satisfactory
J08 0800  7    cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only
J08 0810  7    about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial
J08 0820  4    cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns. In this
J08 0830  1    test, 130 gallons of a suspension, having a count of
J08 0830 11    **f organisms per ml, or a total of approximately
J08 0840  8    **f spores, was aerosolized. The spraying operation
J08 0850  3    was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel,
J08 0860  2    cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure
J08 0860 13    breeze. Spraying continued along a two-mile course.
J08 0870  8       This operation was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted
J08 0880  8    for 29 minutes. There was a slight lapse condition,
J08 0890  5    a moderate fog, and 100 per cent relative humidity.
J08 0900  2    A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore.
J08 0900 13    These were located at the homes of Government employees,
J08 0910  9    in Government Offices, buildings and reservations within
J08 0920  6    the trial area. A rough attempt was made to characterize
J08 0930  6    the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples
J08 0940  3    from outside the windows on the first, ninth, and fifteenth
J08 0950  1    floors of a Government office building.
J08 0950  7       All samplers were operated for a period of two hours
J08 0960  8    except one, which was operated for four hours. In this
J08 0970  6    instance, there was a dosage of 562 during the first
J08 0980  2    two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour
J08 0980 14    period, a four-fold increase. This suggests that the
J08 0990  9    sampling period, particularly at the more distant locations,
J08 1000  6    should have been increased.
J08 1010  1       As can be seen from Figure 2, an extensive area
J08 1010 11    was covered by this aerosol. The maximum distance sampled
J08 1020  6    was 23 miles from the source. As can be seen from these
J08 1030  7    dosage isopleths, approximately 100 square miles was
J08 1040  3    covered within the area sampled. It is quite likely
J08 1040 12    that an even greater area was covered, particularly
J08 1050  8    downwind. The dosages in the three levels of the vertical
J08 1060  8    profile were: **f
J08 1060 11       This was not, of course, enough sampling to give
J08 1070  8    a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion
J08 1080  5    of the aerosol.
J08 1080  8       A number of unique medical problems might be created
J08 1090  5    when man is exposed to an infectious agent through
J08 1100  3    the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal
J08 1105  1    of entry. Some agents have been shown to be much more
J08 1110 10    toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed
J08 1120  6    to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural
J08 1130  6    portal. Botulinal toxin, for example, is several thousand-fold
J08 1140  3    more toxic by this route than when given per os. In
J08 1150  2    some instances a different clinical disease picture
J08 1150  9    may result from this route of exposure, making diagnosis
J08 1160  7    difficult. In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure,
J08 1170  4    one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of
J08 1180  3    "rabbit fever" on a finger.
J08 1180  8       An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is
J08 1190  6    believed to be highly infectious. Agents that are known
J08 1200  4    to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers
J08 1210  1    such as those causing Q fever, tularemia, brucellosis,
J08 1210  9    glanders, coccidioidomycosis, etc., belong in this
J08 1220  6    category.
J08 1220  7       An agent would likely be selected which would possess
J08 1230  7    sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet
J08 1240  4    realistic minimal logistic requirements. It is, obviously,
J08 1250  3    a proper goal of research to improve on this property.
J08 1260  1    In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated
J08 1260 11    without excessive destruction. Moreover, it should
J08 1270  6    not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as
J08 1280  5    to make production on a militarily significant scale
J08 1290  2    improbable.
J08 1290  3       An aggressor would use an agent against which there
J08 1300  3    was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced
J08 1310  1    immunity in a target population. A solid immunity is
J08 1310 10    the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a
J08 1320  6    specific agent can be neutralized. It must be remembered,
J08 1330  5    however, that there are many agents for which there
J08 1340  2    is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity
J08 1340 13    may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent.
J08 1350  8       There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which
J08 1360  5    selection for a specified military purpose might be
J08 1370  3    made. An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating
J08 1370 11    microorganism, a chronic disease producer or one causing
J08 1380  8    a high rate of lethality.
J08 1390  1       It is possible that certain mutational forms may
J08 1390  9    be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains. Mutants
J08 1400  7    may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties
J08 1410  6    that are of importance in identification. All of these
J08 1420  5    considerations are of critical importance in considering
J08 1430  3    defense and medical management.
J08 1430  7       Biological agents are, of course, highly host-specific.
J08 1440  7    They do not destroy physical structures as is true
J08 1450  5    of high explosives. This may be of overriding importance
J08 1460  2    in considering military objectives.
J08 1460  6       The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion.
J08 1470  7    Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem.
J08 1480  6    Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed
J08 1490  5    that the only potential would be in the establishment
J08 1500  1    of epidemics. They then point out that with our present
J08 1500 11    lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the
J08 1510 10    rise and fall of epidemics, it is unlikely that a planned
J08 1520  9    episode could be initiated. They argue further (and
J08 1530  5    somewhat contradictorily) that our knowledge and resources
J08 1540  3    in preventive medicine would make it possible to control
J08 1550  1    such an outbreak of disease. this is why this approach
J08 1550 11    to BW defense has not been given major attention.
J08 1560  8       Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish
J08 1570  7    in an initial attack on a target. This, of course,
J08 1580  3    does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose
J08 1590  1    agents that are associated naturally with epidemic
J08 1590  8    disease. A hypothetical example will illustrate this
J08 1600  5    point. Let us assume that it would be possible for
J08 1610  4    an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent
J08 1620  1    of epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazwki) over City
J08 1620  8    A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever
J08 1630 10    resulted therefrom. No epidemic was initiated nor was
J08 1640  5    one expected because the population in City A was
J08 1650  3    not lousy. Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic
J08 1650 11    typhus. In this case, then, the military objective
J08 1660  8    was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through
J08 1670  6    the results secured in the initial attack. This was
J08 1680  4    done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic.
J08 1690  1    On the other hand, a similar attack might have been
J08 1690 11    made on City B whose population was known to be lousy.
J08 1700  9    One might expect some spread of the disease in this
J08 1710  7    case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack.
J08 1720  4       The major defensive problems are concerned with
J08 1730  2    the possibility of overt military delivery of biological
J08 1730 10    agents from appropriate disseminating devices. It should
J08 1740  6    be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other
J08 1750  7    weapons. The same delivery vehicles- whether they be
J08 1760  6    airplanes, submarines or guided missiles- should be
J08 1770  2    usable. If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic
J08 1770 14    bomb on a city, it should be equally possible to put
J08 1780 10    a cloud of biological agent over that city.
J08 1790  4       Biological agents are, moreover, suitable for delivery
J08 1800  3    through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems
J08 1800 10    in defense. A few obvious target areas of great importance
J08 1810  9    might be mentioned. The air conditioning and ventilating
J08 1820  6    systems of large buildings are subject to attack. America
J08 1830  5    is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed, precooked
J08 1840  3    and even predigested foods. This is an enormous industry
J08 1850  2    that is subject to sabotage. One must include the preparation
J08 1860  1    of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk
J08 1860 11    products. Huge industries are involved also in the
J08 1870  7    production of biological products, drugs and cosmetics
J08 1880  4    which are liable to this type of attack.
