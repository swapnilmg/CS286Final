N17 0010  1       I guided her to the divan, turned off the TV, faced
N17 0010 12    her. She sat quietly, staring at me from the wide eyes.
N17 0020 11    And what eyes they were. Big and dark, a melting, golden
N17 0030  8    brown. Eyes like hot honey, eyes that sizzled. Plus
N17 0040  5    flawless skin, smooth brow and cheeks, lips that looked
N17 0050  2    as if you could get a shock from them. It was a disturbingly
N17 0060  1    familiar face, too, but I couldn't remember where we
N17 0060 10    had met.
N17 0070  1       I said, "Do we know each other, Miss"?
N17 0070  9       "No, I remembered reading about you in the papers
N17 0080  8    and that you lived here, and when it happened all I
N17 0090  6    could think of was"- This time she stopped the rush
N17 0100  3    of words herself. "I'm sorry. Shall I go on"? She smiled.
N17 0110  3    It was her first smile. But worth waiting for.
N17 0120  1       "Sure". I said. "But one word at a time, O.K."?
N17 0120 11    She was still hugging the stained coat around her,
N17 0140  8    so I said, "Relax, let me take your things. Would you
N17 0150  7    like a drink, or coffee"?
N17 0160  1       "No, thanks". She stood up, pulled the coat from
N17 0160 10    her shoulders and started to slide it off, then let
N17 0170  8    out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched,
N17 0180  6    wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out. She was
N17 0190  2    wearing nothing beneath the coat. She jerked the coat
N17 0190 11    back on and squeezed it around her again, but not soon
N17 0200  9    enough. There had been a good second or two during
N17 0210  6    which my muffler had been blowing out, and now I was
N17 0220  4    certain I'd seen her somewhere before.
N17 0220 10    ##
N17 0220 11    "I forgot"! she yelped. "Oh, do forgive me. I'm sorry"!
N17 0240  1       "I forgive"-
N17 0240  3       "That's what started all the trouble in the first
N17 0250  3    place. Oh, dear, I'm all unstrung".
N17 0250  9       "You and me both, dear. Haven't we ... haven't I
N17 0260  9    seen you ... I mean, surely we've"-
N17 0270  3       "You may have seen me on TV", she said. "I've done
N17 0280  5    several filmed commercials for"-
N17 0290  1       Then it hit me. "ZING"! I cried.
N17 0290  8       "Why, yes. And you recognized me"?
N17 0300  4       "Yes, indeed. In fact, I was watching you on that
N17 0310  4    little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell.
N17 0320  1    Man, you rang- it was in color, too, Miss, and ...
N17 0320 12    Miss? What's your name, anyway? Ah, you were splendid".
N17 0330  8    I sat by her on the divan. "Splendid. In a waterfall
N17 0340  7    ... and all that".
N17 0350  1       "That's the last one we did. That was a fun one".
N17 0350 11       "I'll bet. It was fun for me, all right. I don't
N17 0360 11    mean to pry, but do they hide the swimsuit with the
N17 0370  7    bubbles? I mean: Is advertising honest?
N17 0380  2       "It depends on who does it. I never wear anything
N17 0390  1    at all. It wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair, somehow".
N17 0400  1       "I couldn't agree with you more".
N17 0400  7       "I really do have something important to tell you,
N17 0410  5    Mr. Scott. About the murder".
N17 0420  1       "Murder? Oh, yeah", I said. "Tell me about the murder".
N17 0430  1       She told me. ZING was the creation of two men, Louis
N17 0440  1    Thor and Bill Blake, partners in ZING!, Inc. They'd
N17 0450  1    peddled the soap virtually alone, and without much
N17 0450  9    success, until about a year ago, when- with the addition
N17 0460  9    of "SX-21" to their secret formula and the inauguration
N17 0470  6    of a high-powered advertising campaign- sales had soared
N17 0480  4    practically into orbit. Their product had been endorsed
N17 0490  3    by Good Housekeeping, the A.M.A., and the Veterinary
N17 0500  2    Journal, among other repositories of higher wisdom,
N17 0510  1    and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of
N17 0510 12    their soap in the john, even your best friends would
N17 0520  8    think you didn't bathe.
N17 0530  1       My lovely caller- Joyce Holland was her name- had
N17 0530 10    previously done three filmed commercials for ZING,
N17 0540  7    and this evening, the fourth, a super production, had
N17 0550  5    been filmed at the home of Louis Thor. The water in
N17 0560  4    Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket
N17 0570  1    of thick, foamy soapsuds- fashioned, of course, from
N17 0570  9    ZING- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool,
N17 0580 12    then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious "bath" while
N17 0590  6    cameras rolled. The finished- and drastically cut-
N17 0600  6    product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering
N17 0610  3    the suds, then bursting above the pool's surface clad
N17 0620  1    in layers of lavender lather, and I had a hunch this
N17 0620 12    item was going to sell tons and tons of soap; even
N17 0630  9    to clean men and boys.
N17 0640  1       Joyce went on, "When we'd finished, Lou- Mr. Thor-
N17 0640  9    asked me to stay a little longer. He wanted a few stills
N17 0650 12    for magazine ads, he said. Everybody left and I stayed
N17 0660  8    in the pool, then Lou came back alone and leaped into
N17 0670  6    the pool too. And he didn't have any clothes on".
N17 0680  2       "He didn't"!
N17 0680  4       "Yes, he didn't. Did, I mean". She paused. "Did
N17 0690  7    leap into the pool, and didn't have anything on. Anyway,
N17 0700  5    it was evident what he had in mind".
N17 0710  1       "You got away, didn't you"?
N17 0710  6       "Yes. He caught up with me once and grabbed me,
N17 0720  9    but I was all covered with ZING- it's very slippery,
N17 0730  6    you know".
N17 0730  8       "I didn't know. I wouldn't have the stuff in the
N17 0740  8    house. But I'm pleased to hear"-
N17 0750  1       "So I just scooted out of his clutches. I swam like
N17 0760  2    mad, got out of the pool, grabbed my robe, and ran
N17 0760 13    to the car. The keys were still in it, and I was miles
N17 0770 10    away before I remembered that my clothes and purse
N17 0780  6    and everything were still in the little cabana where
N17 0790  2    I'd changed".
N17 0790  4       She'd driven around for a while, Joyce said, then,
N17 0800  4    thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that
N17 0810  1    time, she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive,
N17 0810 12    parked in front, and walked toward the pool. While
N17 0820  9    several yards from it, still concealed by the shrubbery,
N17 0830  5    she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge.
N17 0840  3    She went on:
N17 0840  6       "A man was holding onto Lou, holding him up. Maybe
N17 0850  5    Lou was only unconscious, but right then I thought
N17 0860  2    he must be dead. The man shoved him into the water,
N17 0860 13    then ran past the cabana. There's a walk there that
N17 0870  9    goes out to Quebec Drive. I was so scared ... well,
N17 0880  7    I just ran to my car and came here".
N17 0890  1       "You know who the other man was"?
N17 0890  8       "No, I never did see his face. I didn't get a good
N17 0900 10    look at him at all, his back was to me, and I was so
N17 0910  8    scared ... It was just somebody in a man's suit. But
N17 0920  3    I'm sure the other one was Lou".
N17 0920 10       What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house
N17 0930 10    and "do whatever detectives do", and get her clothes-
N17 0940  6    and handbag containing her identification. She realized
N17 0950  3    I'd have to notify the police, but fervently hoped
N17 0960  2    I could avoid mentioning her name.
N17 0960  8       Her impact in the ZING commercials had led to her
N17 0970  7    being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming
N17 0980  5    TV series, Underwater Western Eye, a documentary-type
N17 0990  3    show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits. But if Joyce
N17 1000  1    got involved in murder or salacious scandal, the role
N17 1000 10    would probably go to the sponsor's wife, Mrs. Oatnut
N17 1010  8    Grits. Or at least not to Joyce.
N17 1020  3       "And I so want the part", she said. "The commercials
N17 1030  2    have just been for money, there hasn't been any real
N17 1030 12    incentive for me to do them, but in Underwater Western
N17 1040 10    Eye I'd have a chance to act. I could show what I can
N17 1050 12    do".
N17 1050 13    ##
N17 1050 14    As far as I was concerned, she had already and had
N17 1060 11    dandily shown what she could do. But I promised Joyce
N17 1070  8    I would mention her name, if at all, only as a last
N17 1080  7    resort. Seeming much relieved, she smiled one of those
N17 1090  3    worth-waiting-for smiles, and I smiled all the way
N17 1090 13    into the bedroom. There I got my Colt Special and shoulder
N17 1100 10    harness, slipped my coat on, and went back into the
N17 1110  9    front room.
N17 1110 11       Joyce squirmed a little on the divan. "I'm starting
N17 1120  8    to itch", she said.
N17 1130  1       "Itch"?
N17 1130  2       "Yes, I'm still all covered with that soap. I was
N17 1140  4    loaded with suds when I ran away, and I haven't had
N17 1140 15    a chance to wash it off. Mmmm, it sure itches".
N17 1150 10       "You might as well wait here while I'm gone, so
N17 1160  9    you can use my shower if you'd like".
N17 1170  2       "Oh, I'd love to". I showed her the shower and tub,
N17 1180  3    and she said, smiling, "If you really don't mind, I
N17 1180 13    think I'll get clean in the shower, then soak for a
N17 1190 11    few minutes in your tub. That always relaxes me. Doesn't
N17 1200  7    it you"?
N17 1200  9       "Only when I do it". I shook my head. One of my
N17 1210 12    virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination
N17 1220  7    complete with sound effects and glorious living color.
N17 1230  4    "Soak ... as long as you want, Joyce. It'll probably
N17 1240  2    be at least an hour or two before I can check back
N17 1240 14    with you. So you'll have everything all to yourself,
N17 1250  9    doggone ..."
N17 1260  1       I looked at my watch. Ten after nine. Time to go,
N17 1260 12    I supposed. "Well, goodbye", I said.
N17 1270  5       "Goodbye. You'd better hurry".
N17 1280  1       "Oh, you can count on that".
N17 1280  7       She smiled slightly. Softly. Warmly. "Don't hurry
N17 1290  5    too much. I'll be soaking for ... at least half an
N17 1300  7    hour".
N17 1300  8       That was all she said. But suddenly those hot-honey
N17 1310  6    eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in
N17 1320  4    them. However, when there's a job to be done, I'm a
N17 1330  2    monstrosity of grim determination, I like to think.
N17 1330 10    I spun about and clattered through the front room to
N17 1340  8    the door. As I went out, I could hear water pouring
N17 1350  5    in the shower. Hot water. She wouldn't be taking a
N17 1360  3    cold shower. Hell, she couldn't.
N17 1360  8       Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from
N17 1370  8    the Spartan, and it took me less than five minutes
N17 1380  3    to get there. But the scene was not the quiet, calm
N17 1380 14    scene I'd expected. Four cars were parked at the curb,
N17 1390 10    and two of them were police radio cars. Lights blazed
N17 1400  7    in the big house and surrounding grounds. I followed
N17 1410  4    a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to
N17 1420  3    the pool. Two uniformed officers, a couple of plain-clothesmen
N17 1430  1    I knew, and two other men stood on a gray cement area
N17 1430 13    next to the pool on my left. At the pool's far end
N17 1440 10    was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned, and on the
N17 1450  6    water's surface floated scattered lavender patches
N17 1460  2    of limp-looking lather. A few yards beyond the group
N17 1460 12    of men, a man's nude body lay face down on a patch
N17 1470 11    of thick green dichondra.
N17 1480  1       Lieutenant Rawlins, one of the plain-clothesmen,
N17 1480  8    spotted me and said, "Hi, Shell", and walked toward
N17 1490  9    me. "How'd you hear about this one"? I grinned, but
N17 1500  8    ignored the question. He didn't push it; Rawlins worked
N17 1510  5    out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years.
N17 1520  5       He filled me in. A call to the police had been placed
N17 1530  4    from here a couple of minutes after nine p.m., and
N17 1540  2    the first police car had arrived two or three minutes
N17 1540 12    after that- 10 minutes ago now. Present at the scene-
N17 1550 11    in addition to the dead man, who was indeed Louis Thor-
N17 1560  7    had been Thor's partner Bill Blake, and Antony Rose,
N17 1570  5    an advertising agency executive who handled the ZING
N17 1580  3    account. Neither of them, I understood, had been present
N17 1590  1    at the filming session earlier.
N17 1590  6       "What were they doing here"? I asked Rawlins.
N17 1600  4       "They were supposed to meet Thor at nine p.m. for
N17 1610  5    a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap,
N17 1620  2    a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff".
N17 1620 11       "Yeah, I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration
N17 1630 10    lately. What is the gunk"?
N17 1640  5       "How would I know? It's a secret. That was the new
N17 1650  5    advertising angle- something about a Lloyd's of London
N17 1660  3    policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient.
N17 1660 12    Actually, only two men know what the formula is, Blake
N17 1670 10    and"- He stopped and looked at Thor's body.
N17 1680  7       I said, "O.K., so now only Blake knows. How's it
N17 1690  8    strike you, foul or fair"?
N17 1700  1       "Can't say yet. Deputy coroner says it looks like
N17 1700 10    he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled
N17 1710 11    on 'em. The PM might show he drowned instead, but
N17 1720  7    that's what the once-over-lightly gives us. Accident,
N17 1730  4    murder, suicide- take your pick".
N17 1740  1       "I'll pick murder. Anything else"?
N17 1740  6       "According to Rose, he arrived here a couple minutes
N17 1750  7    before nine and spotted Thor in the water, got a hooked
N17 1760  6    pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling
N17 1770  2    him out.
