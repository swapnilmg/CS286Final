G30 0010  1    Copernicus did not question it, Ptolemy could not.
G30 0010  9    Given the conceptual context within which ancient thought
G30 0020  6    thrived, how could anyone have questioned this principle?
G30 0030  4    The reasons for this are partly observational, partly
G30 0040  2    philosophical, and reinforced by other aesthetic and
G30 0050  1    cultural factors.
G30 0050  3       First, the observational reasons. The obvious natural
G30 0060  2    fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of
G30 0060 11    the heavens. Not only did constellations like Draco,
G30 0070  8    Cepheus, and Cassiopeia spin circles around the pole,
G30 0080  6    but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at
G30 0090  5    the same place on the horizon each night. Nor did a
G30 0100  2    constellation's stars vary in brightness during the
G30 0100  9    course of their nocturnal flights. The conclusion-
G30 0110  5    the distances of the constellations did not vary and
G30 0120  5    their paths were circular. Moreover, the sun's path
G30 0130  2    over earth described a segment of a great circle; this
G30 0130 12    was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by
G30 0140 10    a gnomon before and after noon.
G30 0150  2       As early as the VIth century B.C. the earth was
G30 0160  2    seen to be spherical. Ships disappear hull-first over
G30 0160 11    the horizon; approaching shore their masts appeared
G30 0170  6    first. Earth, being at the center of the universe,
G30 0180  6    would have the same shape as the latter; so, e.g. did
G30 0190  4    Aristotle argue, although this may not be an observational
G30 0200  1    reason in favor of circularity. The discoid shapes
G30 0200  9    of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape
G30 0210 11    of celestial things.
G30 0220  1       In light of all this, one would require special
G30 0220 10    reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies
G30 0230  9    were other than circular. Why, for example, should
G30 0240  5    the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of
G30 0250  2    the heavens to be elliptical? Or oviform? Or angular?
G30 0260  1    There were no reasons for such suppositions then. This,
G30 0260 10    conjoined with the considerations above, made the circular
G30 0270  8    motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly
G30 0280  6    observed fact.
G30 0280  8       Additional philosophical considerations, advanced
G30 0290  3    notably by Aristotle, supported further the circularity
G30 0300  3    principle. By distinguishing superlunary (celestial)
G30 0310  1    and sublunary (terrestrial) existence, and reinforcing
G30 0310  7    this with the four-element physics of Empedocles, Aristotle
G30 0320  8    came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies, which
G30 0330  7    moved in only a perfect way, viz. in a perfect circle.
G30 0340  5       Now what is perfect motion? It must, apparently,
G30 0350  2    be motion without termini. Because motion which begins
G30 0350 10    and ends at discrete places would (e.g. for Aristotle)
G30 0360  9    be incomplete. Circular motion, however, since it is
G30 0370  7    eternal and perfectly continuous, lacks termini. It
G30 0380  4    is never motion towards something. Only imcomplete,
G30 0390  1    imperfect things move towards what they lack. Perfect,
G30 0390  9    complete entities, if they move at all, do not move
G30 0400 10    towards what they lack. They move only in accordance
G30 0410  6    with what is in their natures. Thus, circular motion
G30 0420  2    is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely
G30 0430  1    perfect celestial existence.
G30 0430  4       To return now to the four-element physics, a mixture
G30 0440  4    of muddy, frothy water will, when standing in a jar,
G30 0450  3    separate out with earth at the bottom, water on top,
G30 0450 13    and the air on top of that. A candle alight in the
G30 0460 11    air directs its flame and smoke upwards. This gives
G30 0470  5    a clue to the cosmical order of elements. Thus earth
G30 0480  3    has fallen to the center of the universe. It is covered
G30 0480 14    (partly) with water, air is atop of that. Pure fire
G30 0490 10    (the stars) is in the heavens. When combined with the
G30 0500  7    metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe
G30 0510  4    are best appreciated when least embodied in a material
G30 0520  1    substratum, it becomes clear that while earth will
G30 0520  9    be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios, celestial
G30 0530  7    bodies will be of a subtle, quickened, ethereal existence,
G30 0540  4    in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant
G30 0550  3    component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.
G30 0560  1       The stars constitute an order of existence different
G30 0560  9    from what we encounter on earth. This is clear when
G30 0570  9    one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to
G30 0580  5    both regions. A projectile shot up from earth returns
G30 0590  2    rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest. But the
G30 0600  1    natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither
G30 0600  9    rest, nor rectilinear motion. Being less encumbered
G30 0610  5    by material embodiments they partake more of what is
G30 0620  5    divine. Their motion will be eternal and perfect.
G30 0630  1       Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between
G30 0630  9    Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy. Bluntly, there
G30 0640  6    never was a Ptolemaic system of astronomy. Copernicus'
G30 0650  4    achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy.
G30 0660  3    The Almagest and the Hypotheses outline Ptolemy's conception
G30 0670  3    of his own task as the provision of computational tables,
G30 0680  2    independent calculating devices for the prediction
G30 0690  1    of future planetary perturbations. Indeed, in the Halma
G30 0690  9    edition of Theon's presentation of the Hypotheses there
G30 0700  6    is a chart setting out (under six distinct headings)
G30 0710  6    otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary
G30 0720  3    motions. No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld into
G30 0730  2    a single scheme (a la Aristotle), these independent
G30 0730 10    predicting-machines. They all have this in common:
G30 0740  7    the earth is situated near the center of the deferent.
G30 0750  7    But that one should superimpose all these charts, run
G30 0760  4    a pin through the common point, and then scale each
G30 0770  1    planetary deferent larger and smaller (to keep the
G30 0770  9    epicycles from 'bumping'), this is contrary to any
G30 0780  6    intention Ptolemy ever expresses. He might even suppose
G30 0790  5    the planets to move at infinity. Ptolemy's problem
G30 0800  2    is to forecast where, against the inverted bowl of
G30 0800 11    night, some particular light will be found at future
G30 0810  8    times. His problem concerns longitudes, latitudes,
G30 0820  3    and angular velocities. The distances of these points
G30 0830  2    of light is a problem he cannot master, beyond crude
G30 0830 12    conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits
G30 0840  9    viewed outward from earth. But none of this has prevented
G30 0850  7    scientists, philosophers, and even historians of science,
G30 0860  4    from speaking of the Ptolemaic system, in contrast
G30 0870  2    to the Copernican. This is a mistake. It is engendered
G30 0870 12    by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in the Almagest
G30 0880  8    with the geocentric astronomy.
G30 0890  3       Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain
G30 0900  3    planetary motion. This is what necessitates the nonsystematic
G30 0910  1    character of his astronomy. So when textbooks, like
G30 0910  9    that of Baker set out drawings of the 'Ptolemaic System',
G30 0920 10    complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly
G30 0930 10    bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents,
G30 0940  5    we have nothing but a misleading XXth-century idea
G30 0950  2    of what never existed historically.
G30 0950  7       It is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all
G30 0960  9    his planetary calculations are interdependent. He cannot,
G30 0970  5    e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars, without
G30 0980  6    also making suppositions about the earth's own motion.
G30 0990  4    He cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some
G30 1000  2    form of a three-body problem. In Ptolemaic terms, however,
G30 1010  9    eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter,
G30 1020  7    to be explained directly as possible resultants of
G30 1030  6    epicyclical combinations. In a systematic astronomy,
G30 1040  3    like that of Copernicus, retrogradations become part
G30 1050  2    of the conceptual structure of the system; they are
G30 1050 11    no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable,
G30 1060  7    local planetary motions.
G30 1070  1       Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic
G30 1070  7    vs. Copernican astronomy, turns on the idea of simplicity.
G30 1080  9    It is often stated that Copernican astronomy is 'simpler'
G30 1090  7    than Ptolemaic. Some even say that this is the reason
G30 1100  9    for the ultimate acceptance of the former. Thus, Margenau
G30 1110  5    remarks: "A large number of unrelated epicycles was
G30 1120  3    needed to explain the observations, but otherwise the
G30 1130  1    [Ptolemaic] system served well and with quantitative
G30 1130  8    precision. Copernicus, by placing the sun at the center
G30 1140  8    of the planetary universe, was able to reduce the number
G30 1150  7    of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen. Historical
G30 1160  2    records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the
G30 1170  1    fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution',
G30 1170  8    unaware perhaps of its historical importance, he rested
G30 1180  7    content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction.
G30 1190  6    As an illustration of the principle of simplicity the
G30 1200  4    heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because
G30 1210  1    it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves
G30 1210  9    a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three
G30 1220  9    to seventeen".
G30 1230  1       Without careful qualification this can be misleading.
G30 1230  8    If in any one calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke
G30 1240  7    83 epicycles all at once, while Copernicus never required
G30 1250  5    more than one third this number, then (in the sense
G30 1260  4    obvious to Margenau) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler
G30 1270  1    than Copernican. But no single planetary problem ever
G30 1270  9    required of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one
G30 1280  9    time. This, of course, results from the non-systematic,
G30 1290  5    'cellular' character of Ptolemaic theory. Calculations
G30 1300  3    within the Copernican framework always raised questions
G30 1310  1    about planetary configurations. These could be met
G30 1310  8    only by considering the dynamical elements of several
G30 1320  6    planets at one time. This is more ambitious than Ptolemy
G30 1330  6    is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems.
G30 1340  4    Thus, in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity' is the Ptolemaic
G30 1350  4    theory simpler than the Copernican. The latter required
G30 1360  1    juggling several elements simultaneously. This was
G30 1360  7    not simpler but much more difficult than exercises
G30 1370  7    within Ptolemy's astronomy.
G30 1380  1       Analogously, anyone who argues that Einstein's theory
G30 1380  8    of gravitation is simpler than Newton's, must say rather
G30 1390  9    more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered
G30 1400  9    by student-physicists, while the former can be managed
G30 1410  6    (with difficulty) only by accomplished experts.
G30 1420  1       In a sense, Einstein's theory is simpler than Newton's,
G30 1430  1    and there is a corresponding sense in which Copernicus'
G30 1430 10    theory is simpler than Ptolemy's. But 'simplicity'
G30 1440  7    here refers to systematic simplicity. The number of
G30 1450  6    primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is
G30 1460  3    reduced to a minimum. The axioms required to make the
G30 1470  3    theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and
G30 1470 11    powerfully, so that all permissible operations within
G30 1480  7    the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms,
G30 1490  6    rules, and primitive notions. This characterizes Euclid's
G30 1500  3    formulation of geometry, but not Ptolemy's astronomy.
G30 1510  2    There are in the Almagest no rules for determining
G30 1520  1    in advance whether a new epicycle will be required
G30 1520 10    for dealing with abberations in lunar, solar, or planetary
G30 1530  7    behavior. The strongest appeal of the Copernican formulation
G30 1540  6    consisted in just this: ideally, the justification
G30 1550  3    for dealing with special problems in particular ways
G30 1560  2    is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory.
G30 1560 13    The lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc', never
G30 1570  9    introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the
G30 1580  9    theory some recalcitrant datum. Copernicus, to an extent
G30 1590  5    unachieved by Ptolemy, approximated to Euclid's vision.
G30 1600  3    De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts
G30 1610  2    and techniques. It is an organized system of these
G30 1610 11    things. Solving astronomical problems requires, for
G30 1620  5    Copernicus, not a random search of unrelated tables,
G30 1630  4    but a regular employment of the rules defining the
G30 1640  2    entire discipline.
G30 1640  4       Hence, noting the simplicity achieved in Copernicus'
G30 1650  3    formulation does not provide another reason for the
G30 1660  2    acceptance of De Revolutionibus, another reason beyond
G30 1660  9    its systematic superiority. It provides exactly the
G30 1670  7    same reason.
G30 1680  1       1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of
G30 1680 10    the scientific revolution. It is really the funeral
G30 1690  7    day of scholastic science. Granted, the cosmological,
G30 1700  3    philosophical, and cultural reverberations initiated
G30 1710  2    by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing
G30 1710 10    violence during the 300 years to follow. But, considered
G30 1720  9    within technical astronomy, a different pattern can
G30 1730  6    be traced.
G30 1730  8       In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer
G30 1740  6    consist? What in the Almagest draws his fire? Geocentricism
G30 1750  6    per se? No. The formal displacement of the geocentric
G30 1760  6    principle far from being Copernicus' primary concern,
G30 1770  3    was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable
G30 1780  4    in orthodox astronomy, namely, the 'unphysical' triplication
G30 1790  2    of centric reference-points: one center from which
G30 1800  1    the planet's distances were calculated, another around
G30 1800  8    which planetary velocities were computed, and still
G30 1810  6    a third center (the earth) from which the observations
G30 1820  4    originated. This arrangement was for Copernicus literally
G30 1830  2    monstrous: "With [the Ptolemaists] it is as though
G30 1840  1    an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and
G30 1840 11    other members for his images from divers models, each
G30 1850  8    part excellently drawn, but not related to a single
G30 1860  5    body; and since they in no way match each other, the
G30 1870  2    result would be a monster rather than a man".
G30 1870 11       Copernicus required a systematically integrated,
G30 1880  5    physically intelligible astronomy. His objective was,
G30 1890  4    essentially, to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy
G30 1900  2    responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these
G30 1900  9    ends. That such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's
G30 1910  7    theory was not discovered de novo by Copernicus. The
G30 1920  7    critical, rigorous examinations of Nicholas of Cusa
G30 1930  5    and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context (a late
G30 1940  3    medieval context) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work.
G30 1950  1    The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies.
G30 1950  8    Without abandoning too much, Copernicus sought to make
G30 1960  7    orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically
G30 1970  3    acceptable. He did not think himself to be firing the
G30 1980  3    first shot of an intellectual revolution.
