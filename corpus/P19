P19 0010  1    #@#
P19 0010  2    I DON'T really believe in intuition. But I swear to
P19 0020  1    you from the moment I opened my eyes, I knew it was
P19 0020 13    going to be a bad day. Part of it was the weather,
P19 0030  9    so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the
P19 0040  7    hospital. Part of it was being so tired- I'd not only
P19 0050  3    had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting
P19 0050 13    as well, that kept me up late. But the rest of it,
P19 0060 11    the main part, wasn't based on logic at all. It was
P19 0070  8    just going to be one of those days.
P19 0080  1       For the thousandth time, I wished I'd chosen some
P19 0080 10    nice, nine-to-five, five-days-a-week profession. And
P19 0090  7    for the thousandth time, I answered myself. I hadn't
P19 0100  5    chosen medicine- it had chosen me.
P19 0110  1       Actually, I shouldn't complain, I told myself in
P19 0110  9    the shaving mirror. I had a lot to be thankful for.
P19 0120 10    A profession that brought me as good an income as mine
P19 0130  8    wasn't to be sneezed at. Maybe I didn't see as much
P19 0140  5    of Gladdy as I'd like, but how much worse it would
P19 0150  2    have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after
P19 0150 13    Alice went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home.
P19 0160 11    At least, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges,
P19 0170  9    bless her, to look after us- no mother could be fonder
P19 0180  6    of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was. I was lucky in lots
P19 0190  5    of ways, no doubt about it.
P19 0190 11       Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out. Growing
P19 0200  7    up without a mother from the time she was three- it
P19 0210  5    wasn't a good thing for a child, even knowing the kind
P19 0220  3    of mother Alice had been. But I mustn't start on Alice.
P19 0230  1    She is a closed book, a picture I keep on my bureau,
P19 0230 13    but never look at. If she'd kept on as she'd been going,
P19 0240 10    the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been
P19 0250  6    true by now, anyhow ...
P19 0250 11       As usual, Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the
P19 0260  8    breakfast table. Her first class wasn't until ten,
P19 0270  6    but she always got up to have breakfast with me. It
P19 0280  4    made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all
P19 0290  1    on her own, to go to college right here in town made
P19 0290 13    me feel good, too. Oh, I knew that I couldn't give
P19 0300  8    myself all the credit for her decision. I had a feeling
P19 0310  6    that young Pete Michelson, the most promising intern
P19 0320  2    at Fairview, had something to do with it, too.
P19 0320 11       She'd been out with Pete the night before and her
P19 0330 10    gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little.
P19 0340  8    But once I was alone again, driving to the hospital,
P19 0360  4    the heaviness returned. If she and Pete were really
P19 0370  2    getting serious, I'd have to do some hard thinking.
P19 0370 11    Should I tell him the truth about Alice? Did he have
P19 0380 11    a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all
P19 0390  7    these years?
P19 0390  9       The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside
P19 0400  7    my office when I got to Fairview. Two interns and Dick
P19 0410  5    Ishii, the other resident. I'm Chief of Medicine here
P19 0420  4    and this morning would start like all others, with
P19 0430  1    me taking the boys on the rounds. Pete was down on
P19 0430 12    Seven, Dick told me, and he'd meet us there.
P19 0440  8       There wasn't anything of special interest that morning,
P19 0450  5    no one sicker than they should have been. Pete came
P19 0460  3    to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven-
P19 0470  3    he'd had a case of post-operative shock, but it was
P19 0470 14    all taken care of now. Seven is a women's floor and,
P19 0480  9    as it happened, not very busy right then. When we'd
P19 0490  5    finished our regular rounds, Pete pointed me toward
P19 0500  3    the small ward at the end of the floor.
P19 0500 12       "Got a new one in last night", he said. "I haven't
P19 0510  9    seen her yet, but I hear she's a lulu"!
P19 0520  5       I wasn't surprised. The ward was a small one, four
P19 0530  5    beds, kept reserved for female alcoholics. We didn't
P19 0540  1    get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights.
P19 0540 11    It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the
P19 0550  9    patients in the regular charity ward.
P19 0560  3       The moment I walked in, the whole miserable feeling
P19 0570  1    of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed.
P19 0570 13    They'd cleaned her up some, of course, and she'd pretty
P19 0580  9    much slept off her drunk. But there was something about
P19 0590  6    her- and I felt my lips forming a name. Alice ... But
P19 0610  6    this woman's name was Rose Bancroft!
P19 0620  1       I looked at the chart for reassurance. Yes, Rose
P19 0620 10    Bancroft, diagnosis: acute alcoholism. She looked about
P19 0630  7    sixty, though I recalled that the chart gave her age
P19 0640  7    as forty-four. An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat
P19 0650  3    familiar puffy face, already marred by the tell-tale
P19 0660  1    network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry.
P19 0660 10    Her coarse hair was two-colored- bleached blonde and
P19 0670  7    its real, dirty gray.
P19 0680  1       Oh, could it be? No, no ... it was an unfortunate
P19 0680 11    resemblance, that was all it was, and I turned to Dick,
P19 0690 11    forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind.
P19 0700  6       In a low voice, Dick filled us in ...
P19 0710  2    #@#
P19 0710  3    SHE'D BEEN picked up downtown, passed out in the doorway.
P19 0720  4    Although quiet when they brought her in, she'd suddenly
P19 0730  1    turned violent and had to be knocked out. It was the
P19 0730 12    old story. We'd keep her a day or two, and the AA
P19 0740 11    people would talk to her. But if she wasn't interested,
P19 0750  6    she'd just go back to the same life she'd left.
P19 0760  3       Turning toward the patient again, I- I can't describe
P19 0770  2    what happened to me then, except to say that I felt
P19 0770 13    sick. I tell you, it took every ounce of control I
P19 0780 11    had to be able to speak. "Now, Miss- or is it Mrs.
P19 0790  8    Bancroft"?
P19 0800  1       I never liked going straight into an examination
P19 0810  7    with patients- it relaxes them, I've always thought,
P19 0820  5    to chat first. This was one time I'd have gladly broken
P19 0830  4    my own rule, but habit was too strong.
P19 0840  1       "Hey"! Her voice was flat and dull. But those penetrating
P19 0840 11    eyes- I had to turn my head away. It was then that
P19 0850 14    I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed. There were
P19 0860  5    bloodspots on the sheet.
P19 0870  1       "What's this"? I asked. "Your period"?
P19 0870  7       She shook her head. "I been spotting a little now
P19 0890  9    and then", she said quietly, no emotion in her voice.
P19 0900  6       "Have you spoken to a doctor about it"?
P19 0910  3       Once again, there was a negative shake. I told Miss
P19 0920  2    Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an
P19 0920 13    examining table. "Better do a Papanicolaou", I told
P19 0930  8    Pete. It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins
P19 0940  6    had her in the proper position for a vaginal, but I
P19 0950  5    couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination. Pete
P19 0960  2    stood by with a slide and took the smear, sent it down
P19 0960 14    to the lab with a request for the test. That done,
P19 0970  9    I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed
P19 0980  7    and again put her out of my mind.
P19 0990  1       I was busy the rest of the day. Late in the afternoon,
P19 0990 12    I was up on Seven again. One of my private patients
P19 1000  8    was being admitted and I went in to see her settled.
P19 1010  6    On my way to the elevator, I ran into Pete. "I've got
P19 1020  3    the results on the Bancroft smear test", he said. "There's
P19 1030  2    something there, all right. Class Three, they said.
P19 1040  1    Do you want to talk to her, doctor"?
P19 1040  9       "Well"- I didn't- I didn't ever want to see that
P19 1050 10    woman again. But that was ridiculous, of course. "All
P19 1060  5    right. We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission
P19 1070  4    for a hysterectomy. Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's
P19 1080  2    intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances".
P19 1090  1       "If you can keep her here that long", Pete said
P19 1090 11    wryly. "Groggins tells me she's started badgering already,
P19 1100  7    wants to get out. Wants to get to her booze, I guess".
P19 1120  9       I grimaced in distaste. "Well, better see what I
P19 1130  6    can do".
P19 1130  8       We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's
P19 1140  5    door and as I went to turn the knob to enter, I was
P19 1150  6    surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar.
P19 1160  1    But she seemed to be dozing and in any case, we'd been
P19 1160 13    talking in low tones.
P19 1170  3       Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me, though,
P19 1180  1    and once again, I felt an inward shiver. "I sure can't
P19 1180 12    complain about the service in this place", she said.
P19 1190  9    "I just got through seeing one of you guys. What do
P19 1200  7    you want"? There was something almost insulting in
P19 1210  4    her tone, but I disregarded it.
P19 1210 10       "I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson", I said.
P19 1220  9    "We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage.
P19 1230  8    That's quite minor, nothing to worry about. But we
P19 1240  6    would like your permission to do- that is, to go further
P19 1250  4    if it proves necessary".
P19 1250  8       "No". It was flat, definite.
P19 1260  2       "Suppose you let me explain. Actually, I rather
P19 1270  1    doubt that we'll have to do this. Even if we do, you'll
P19 1270 13    be out of here in a week, probably".
P19 1280  7       I was sure that was the difficulty- she just didn't
P19 1290  6    want to stay here, where she couldn't get to the liquor.
P19 1300  4       "No".
P19 1300  5       I looked at her in amazement. I'd had patients who'd
P19 1310  5    refused surgery before, of course, but never one who
P19 1320  4    didn't show, in one way or another, the reason why.
P19 1330  1    Mostly, it was fear, but this woman's voice didn't
P19 1330 10    tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet.
P19 1340  8       "Will you tell me why"? I asked.
P19 1350  3       She smiled, a smile without humor. "You shouldn't
P19 1360  1    tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door",
P19 1370  1    she said. "I've got cancer, haven't I"? She went on,
P19 1370 11    disregarding my protests. "I'm not going to be one
P19 1380  9    of your guinea pigs. Let your pupils learn on someone
P19 1390  7    else, doctor. Just let me die in peace".
P19 1400  2    #@#
P19 1400  3    I stared at her, almost speechless. Her little speech
P19 1410  2    was totally out of character with the sort of person
P19 1410 12    I thought she was. Even her voice had taken on a more
P19 1420 11    cultivated tone. This was someone who'd come down in
P19 1430  7    the world, I thought. A long, long way down. Again
P19 1440  5    there was something familiar about her, something ...
P19 1450  2       "You haven't got cancer", I said as strongly as
P19 1460  2    I could. "I don't know what you heard that would make
P19 1460 13    you think so, but I assure you I don't even know myself,
P19 1470 12    so how can you be so sure? And even if"-
P19 1480  8       "Don't give me a lot of talk, Joe".
P19 1490  4       I gaped at her. She could have found out my first
P19 1500  3    name, of course- that wouldn't be difficult. But there
P19 1510  1    was that something, some echo in the way she spoke
P19 1510 11    ...
P19 1510 12       She was watching me intently, a funny little half-smile
P19 1520  9    on her lips. "Surprised, baby? Guess I've changed,
P19 1530  5    haven't I? But you haven't changed much, Joe".
P19 1540  4       I knew then, knew with a heart-stopping shock. "Alice"-
P19 1550  3    I stammered through dry lips. "Alice, for goodness
P19 1560  3    sake"-
P19 1560  4       "Alice", she echoed mockingly. "What's the matter,
P19 1570  3    Joe, you scared of me? Think I'm going to make you
P19 1580  4    introduce a drunk as your wife? Well, don't worry.
P19 1580 13    Just let me outta here"-
P19 1590  5       "But why did you come back"? I'd found my voice.
P19 1600  5    "Where have you been all these years"?
P19 1610  1       She shrugged. "Here and there. As for coming back
P19 1610 10    here- well, I'll tell you the truth, I didn't even
P19 1620 10    know where I was when I came to. The last thing I remember
P19 1630  9    is a bar in San Diego"-
P19 1640  3       The way she spoke, her flat acceptance of her alcoholic
P19 1640 13    blackout, made me shudder. And this was Gladdy's mother!
P19 1660  1       "I never asked you for any favors, Joe", she went
P19 1660 10    on, "but I'm asking one now. Let me outta here! You
P19 1670  9    doctors are all alike- all you want is to cut up people
P19 1680  9    and what's the good? No, I want out, Joe"!
P19 1690  3       I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before
P19 1700  1    me. Let her out, let her out- that would be the solution,
P19 1700 13    wouldn't it? What she'd said was true- in all these
P19 1710 10    years, she'd never asked for anything from me. If I
P19 1720  9    let her go, she'd disappear once more. And Gladdy would
P19 1730  6    be safe!
