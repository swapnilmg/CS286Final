J65 0010  1    SO FAR THESE remarks, like most criticisms of Hardy,
J65 0010 10    have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece,
J65 0020 10    one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at
J65 0030  5    a single stage of development. For critics, Hardy has
J65 0040  3    had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early
J65 0040 13    Hardy or late Hardy, or of the London or Max Gate period,
J65 0050 12    but simply of Hardy, as of a poetic monolith. This
J65 0060  9    seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer
J65 0070  6    than any other major English poet: "Domicilium" is
J65 0080  2    dated "between 1857 and 1860"; "Seeing the Moon Rise"
J65 0090  3    is dated August, 1927. One might expect that in a poetic
J65 0100  1    career of seventy-odd years, some changes in style
J65 0100 10    and method would have occurred, some development taken
J65 0110  6    place.
J65 0110  7       This is not, however, the case, and development
J65 0120  5    is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very
J65 0130  5    limited sense. In a time when poetic style, and poetic
J65 0140  1    belief as well, seem in a state of continual flux,
J65 0140 11    Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency.
J65 0150  8    Though he struggled with philosophy all his life, he
J65 0160  6    never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties;
J65 0170  2    the "sober opinion" of his letter to Noyes, written
J65 0180  1    when Hardy was eighty years old, is essentially that
J65 0180 10    of his first "philosophical" notebook entry, made when
J65 0190  5    he was twenty-five: "The world does not despise us:
J65 0200  6    it only neglects us" (Early Life, p. 63). And though
J65 0210  5    in his later years he revised his poems many times,
J65 0220  2    the revisions did not alter the essential nature of
J65 0220 11    the style which he had established before he was thirty;
J65 0230  9    so that, while it usually is easy to recognize a poem
J65 0240  7    by Hardy, it is difficult to date one.
J65 0250  1       There is only one sense in which it is valid to
J65 0250 12    talk about Hardy's development: he did develop toward
J65 0260  7    a more consistent and more effective control of that
J65 0270  6    tone which we recognize as uniquely his. There is only
J65 0280  4    one Hardy style, but in the earlier poems that style
J65 0290  1    is only intermittently evident, and when it is not,
J65 0290 10    the style is the style of another poet, or of the fashion
J65 0300  9    of the time. In the later poems, however, the personal
J65 0310  4    tone predominates. The bad early poems are bad Shakespeare
J65 0320  3    or bad Swinburne; the bad late poems are bad Hardy.
J65 0340  1       There are two ways of getting at a poet's development:
J65 0350  1    through his dated poems, and through the revisions
J65 0350  9    which he made in later editions of his work. About
J65 0360  6    a quarter of Hardy's poems carry an appended date line,
J65 0370  5    usually the year of completion, but sometimes inclusive
J65 0380  1    years ("1908-1910") or two separate dates when Hardy
J65 0380 10    worked on the poem ("1905 and 1926") or an approximate
J65 0390 10    date ("During the War"). These dates are virtually
J65 0400  7    the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems,
J65 0410  6    since the separate volumes are neither chronological
J65 0420  1    within themselves nor in relation to each other. With
J65 0420 10    the exception of Satires of Circumstance, each volume
J65 0430  8    contains dated poems ranging over several decades (Winter
J65 0440  7    Words spans sixty-one years); the internal organization
J65 0450  5    rarely has any chronological order, except in obvious
J65 0460  4    groups like the "Poems of Pilgrimage", the "Poems of
J65 0470  3    1912-13", and the war poems.
J65 0470  9       From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions
J65 0480  6    about Hardy's career in poetry, always remembering
J65 0490  3    that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must
J65 0500  2    remain tentative. The dated poems suggest that while
J65 0500 10    Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant,
J65 0510  8    his production was not. He had two productive periods,
J65 0520  6    one in the late 1860's, the other in the decade from
J65 0530  5    1910 to 1920 (half of the dated poems are from the
J65 0540  1    latter period, and these alone total about one-tenth
J65 0540 10    of all Hardy's poems). There was one sterile period:
J65 0550  7    only one poem is dated between 1872 and 1882 and, except
J65 0560  6    for the poems written on the trip to Italy in 1887,
J65 0570  3    very few from 1882 to 1890.
J65 0570  9       The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree
J65 0580  8    to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various
J65 0590  4    volumes, and therefore probably are an indication of
J65 0600  2    the amount of poetry he was writing at the time. Poems
J65 0600 13    of the Past and the Present and Time's Laughingstocks,
J65 0610  7    both published while Hardy was at work on The Dynasts,
J65 0620  9    draw heavily on poems written before 1900. Satires
J65 0630  5    of Circumstance and Moments of Vision, coming during
J65 0640  4    his most productive decade, are relatively self-contained;
J65 0650  1    the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that
J65 0660  1    is, no poem from a period covered by a previous volume-
J65 0660 12    and the latter has only a few such. The last three
J65 0670 10    volumes are again more dependent on the past, as Hardy's
J65 0680  6    creative powers declined in his old age.
J65 0690  2       These observations about Hardy's productivity tally
J65 0690  8    with the details of his life as we know them. The first
J65 0700 12    productive period came when he was considering poetry
J65 0710  7    as a vocation, before he had decided to write fiction
J65 0720  4    for a living (in his note for Who's Who he wrote that
J65 0730  4    he "wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose,
J65 0740  1    1868-70; but resumed it later"). During the poetically
J65 0740 10    sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of
J65 0750 10    almost one a year and was, in addition, burdened with
J65 0760  5    bad health (he spent six months in bed in 1881, too
J65 0770  2    ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A
J65 0770 13    Laodicean). Two entries in the Early Life support the
J65 0780  9    assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually
J65 0790  7    suspended the writing of poetry. Mrs. Hardy records
J65 0800  4    that "... at the end of November [1881] he makes a
J65 0810  4    note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible"
J65 0820  1    (Early Life, p. 188); and on Christmas Day, 1890, Hardy
J65 0830  1    wrote: "While thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings
J65 0830  9    of poesy' before dawn this morning, new horizons seemed
J65 0840  9    to open, and worrying pettinesses to disappear" (Early
J65 0850  5    Life, p. 302). There are more poems dated in the 1890's
J65 0860  8    than in the '80's- Hardy had apparently resumed the
J65 0870  5    viewless wings as he decreased the volume of his fiction-
J65 0880  4    but none in 1891, the year of Tess, and only one in
J65 0890  2    1895, the year of Jude. After 1895 the number increases,
J65 0890 12    and in the next thirty years there is only one year
J65 0900 11    for which there is no dated poem- 1903, when Hardy
J65 0910  6    was at work on The Dynasts.
J65 0920  1       The second productive period, the decade from 1910
J65 0920  9    to 1920, can be related to three events: the completion
J65 0930  8    of The Dynasts in 1909, which left Hardy free of pressure
J65 0940  7    for the first time in forty years; the death of Emma
J65 0950  5    Hardy in 1912, which had a profound emotional effect
J65 0960  2    on Hardy for which he found release in poetry; and
J65 0960 12    the First World War. It may seem strange that a poet
J65 0970 10    should come to full fruition in his seventies, but
J65 0980  6    we have it on Hardy's own authority that "... he was
J65 0990  5    a child till he was sixteen, a youth till he was five-and-twenty,
J65 1000  1    and a young man till he was nearly fifty" (Early Life,
J65 1010  1    p. 42). We may carry this sequence one step further
J65 1010 11    and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height
J65 1020 11    of his powers, wanting only the impetus of two tragedies,
J65 1030  6    one personal, the other national, to loose those powers
J65 1040  4    in poetry.
J65 1040  6       Hardy's two productive decades were separated by
J65 1050  4    forty years, yet between them he developed only in
J65 1060  1    that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing,
J65 1060 11    not an expanding process. Like a wise gardener, Hardy
J65 1070  7    pruned away the Shakespearian sonnets and songs, and
J65 1080  5    the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his
J65 1090  4    personal style was not suited, and let the main stock
J65 1100  1    of his talent flourish. The range of the later poetry
J65 1100 11    is considerably narrower, but the number of successful
J65 1110  7    poems is far greater.
J65 1120  1       We can see the general characteristics of the earlier
J65 1120  9    decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities:
J65 1130  8    "Revulsion" (1866) and "Neutral Tones" (1867). There
J65 1140  6    is not much to be said for "Revulsion". Like about
J65 1150  3    half of the 1860-70 poems, it is a sonnet on a conventional
J65 1160  4    theme- the unhappiness of love. Almost anyone could
J65 1170  1    have written it; it is competent in the sense that
J65 1170 11    it makes a coherent statement without violating the
J65 1180  5    rules of the sonnet form, but it is entirely undistinguished
J65 1190  4    and entirely unlike Hardy. The language is the conventional
J65 1200  4    language of the form; there is no phrase or image that
J65 1210  2    sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give
J65 1210 12    individuality to the poem. It is smoother than Hardy
J65 1220  9    usually is, but with the smoothness of anonymity. It
J65 1230  5    is obviously a young man's poem, written out of books
J65 1240  4    and not out of experience; it asserts emotion without
J65 1250  2    evoking it- that is to say, it is sentimental. There
J65 1250 12    are many such competently anonymous performances among
J65 1260  6    the earlier poems.
J65 1270  1       "Neutral Tones" we immediately recognize as a fine
J65 1270  9    poem in Hardy's most characteristic style: the plain
J65 1280  7    but not quite colloquial language, the hard, particular,
J65 1290  5    colorless images, the slightly odd stanza-form, the
J65 1300  4    dramatic handling of the occasion, the refusal to resolve
J65 1310  2    the issue- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems.
J65 1320  1    The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech
J65 1320 11    nor draw on exotic sources of diction, yet it is obviously
J65 1330  8    not ordinary speech- only Hardy would say "a grin of
J65 1340 10    bitterness swept thereby/Like an ominous bird a-wing",
J65 1350  5    or "wrings with wrong", or would describe a winter
J65 1360  3    sun as "God-curst".
J65 1360  7       The details of the setting of "Neutral Tones" are
J65 1370  5    not, strictly speaking, metaphorical, but they combine
J65 1380  3    to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal
J65 1390  1    winter day and to the end of love, and in this way
J65 1390 13    love and weather, the emotions and the elements, symbolize
J65 1400  6    each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's
J65 1410  5    best poems ("Weathers", "The Darkling Thrush", and
J65 1420  3    "During Wind and Rain", for example) and to some moving
J65 1430  3    passages in the novels as well (Far From the Madding
J65 1440  1    Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way).
J65 1440 10       "Neutral Tones" is an excellent example of Hardy's
J65 1450  8    mature style, drawn from his earliest productive period;
J65 1460  6    I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through
J65 1470  5    new styles as he grew older (as Yeats did), but that
J65 1480  3    he simply learned to use better what he already had.
J65 1480 13    In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's
J65 1490  8    sense of the world; if it is somber, it is also precise,
J65 1500  8    and the precision lends authority to the vision. In
J65 1510  4    "Revulsion", on the other hand, the pessimism is a
J65 1520  2    case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade
J65 1520 11    us of the speaker's right to speak as he does. In the
J65 1530  9    1860-70 decade there are many poems like "Revulsion",
J65 1540  5    but there is only one "Neutral Tones". Hardy was not
J65 1550  4    Hardy very often.
J65 1550  7       The "Poems of 1912-13" offer a good example of Hardy's
J65 1560  7    style as it was manifested in the later productive
J65 1570  5    decade. These are the poems Hardy wrote after the death
J65 1580  3    of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to
J65 1580 13    what might have been, to a marriage that began with
J65 1590 10    a promise of happiness, and ended in long years of
J65 1600  7    suffering and hatred. Hardy obviously felt that these
J65 1610  3    poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes
J65 1620  1    called them "an expiation", and he would not allow
J65 1620 10    them to be published in periodicals. They are the only
J65 1630  7    poems that he rearranged as a group between their first
J65 1640  6    appearance (in Satires of Circumstance) and the publication
J65 1650  4    of the Collected Poems.
J65 1650  8       The elegiac tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice,
J65 1660  8    and it is not surprising that the 1912-13 poems are
J65 1670  7    consistently and unmistakably his. The view is always
J65 1680  4    toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic-
J65 1690  3    Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense
J65 1690 12    of the irredeemable pastness of the past, and the eternal
J65 1700  8    deadness of the dead. The poems are, the epigraph tells
J65 1710  6    us, the "traces of an ancient flame"; the fire of love
J65 1720  5    is dead, and Hardy stands, as the speaker does in the
J65 1730  3    last poem of the sequence, over the burnt circle of
J65 1730 13    charred sticks, and thinks of past happiness and present
J65 1740  8    grief, honest and uncomforted.
