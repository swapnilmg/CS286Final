H01 0160  7    #TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY#
H01 0170  6    The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides guidance
H01 0180  4    and advice on sources of technical information relating
H01 0190  3    to small business management and research and development
H01 0200  3    of products.
H01 0200  5    _SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT_
H01 0200  8       Practical management problems and their suggested
H01 0210  6    solutions are dealt with in a series of SBA publications.
H01 0220  6    These publications, written especially for the managers
H01 0230  4    or owners of small businesses, indirectly aid in community
H01 0240  2    development programs. They are written by specialists
H01 0240  9    in numerous types of business enterprises, cover a
H01 0250  8    wide range of subjects, and are directed to the needs
H01 0260  7    and interests of the small firm.
H01 0270  1       SBA offers Administrative Management Courses, which
H01 0270  7    are designed to improve the management efficiency and
H01 0280  7    "know-how" of small business concerns within a community.
H01 0290  6    SBA cosponsors these courses with educational institutions
H01 0300  4    and community groups.
H01 0300  7       Through the SBA's Management Counseling Program,
H01 0310  6    practical, personalized advice on sound management
H01 0320  5    principles is available upon request to both prospective
H01 0330  4    and established businessmen in a community. One-day
H01 0340  1    conferences covering some specific phase of business
H01 0340  8    management, also part of the continuing activities
H01 0350  7    of the Small Business Administration, aid community
H01 0360  3    economic development programs. These short, "streamlined"
H01 0370  1    meetings usually are sponsored by local banks, Chambers
H01 0380  1    of Commerce, trade associations, or other civic organizations.
H01 0380  9    _PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_
H01 0390  4       Production specialists in SBA regional offices
H01 0400  3    are available to help individual small business concerns
H01 0410  1    with technical production problems. Guidance and advice
H01 0410  8    are available on new product research and development;
H01 0420  7    new product potential; processing methods; product
H01 0430  4    and market developments; new industrial uses for raw,
H01 0440  4    semi-processed and waste, materials; and industrial
H01 0445  1    uses for agricultural products.
H01 0450  4       SBA serves also as a clearing house for information
H01 0460  4    on products and processes particularly adaptable for
H01 0470  2    exploitation by small firms. This may be helpful in
H01 0470 11    improving the competitive position of established firms
H01 0480  6    through diversification and expansion or through more
H01 0490  5    economical utilization of plant capacity.
H01 0500  1    _PRODUCTION ASSISTANCE_
H01 0500  3       Production specialists are available in SBA regional
H01 0510  3    offices to help individual small business concerns
H01 0520  1    with technical production problems. These problems
H01 0520  7    frequently arise where a firm is making items for the
H01 0530  9    Government not directly along the lines of its normal
H01 0540  5    civilian business or where the Government specifications
H01 0550  1    require operations that the firm did not understand
H01 0550  9    when it undertook the contract. Production assistance
H01 0560  6    often takes the form of locating tools or materials
H01 0570  5    which are urgently needed. Advice is given also on
H01 0580  3    problems of plant location and plant space.
H01 0590  1    _PROPERTY SALES ASSISTANCE_
H01 0590  2       The property sales assistance program is designed
H01 0590  9    to assist small business concerns that may wish to
H01 0600  9    buy property offered for sale by the Federal Government.
H01 0610  7    Under this program, property sales specialists in the
H01 0620  4    Small Business Administration regional offices help
H01 0630  2    small business concerns to locate Federal property
H01 0630  9    for sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity
H01 0640  8    to bid competitively for surplus personal and real
H01 0650  5    property and certain natural resources, including timber
H01 0660  2    from the national forests.
H01 0660  6       SBA works closely with the principal property disposal
H01 0670  6    installations of the Federal Government in reviewing
H01 0680  4    proposed sales programs and identifying those types
H01 0690  2    of property that small business concerns are most likely
H01 0690 11    to be interested in purchasing. Proposed property sales
H01 0700  7    of general interest to small business concerns are
H01 0710  6    publicized through SBA regional news releases, and
H01 0720  4    by "flyers" directed to the small business concerns.
H01 0730  1    Each SBA regional office also maintains a "want" list
H01 0740  1    of surplus property, principally machinery and equipment,
H01 0740  8    desired by small business concerns in its area. When
H01 0750  8    suitable equipment is located by the SBA representative,
H01 0760  5    the small business concern is contacted and advised
H01 0770  3    on when, where, and how to bid on such property.
H01 0780  1    _FACILITIES INVENTORY_
H01 0780  3       Section 8 (b) (2) of the Small Business Act, as
H01 0790  3    amended, authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory
H01 0800  1    of the productive facilities of small business concerns.
H01 0800  9    The Administration maintains a productive facilities
H01 0810  5    inventory of small business industrial concerns that
H01 0820  4    have voluntarily registered. It is kept in each Regional
H01 0830  4    office for the small firms within the region. Purpose
H01 0840  1    of this inventory is to include all eligible productive
H01 0840 10    facilities in SBA's facilities register so that the
H01 0850  8    small business concerns may have an opportunity to
H01 0860  6    avail themselves of the services authorized by the
H01 0870  3    Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration.
H01 0880  1    These services include procurement and technical assistance
H01 0880  8    and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid
H01 0890  9    on Government contracts for products and services within
H01 0900  6    the registrants' field of operations. SBA can make
H01 0910  4    complete facilities inventories of all small business
H01 0920  1    concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and
H01 0920  9    staff limitations.

H01 1100  5    #LOANS#
H01 1110  1    _TO SMALL BUSINESS_
H01 1110  1       SBA makes loans to individual small business firms,
H01 1110  9    providing them with financing when it is not otherwise
H01 1120  9    available through private lending sources on reasonable
H01 1130  5    terms. Many such loans have been made to establish
H01 1140  3    small concerns or to aid in their growth, thereby contributing
H01 1150  1    substantially to community development programs.
H01 1160  1    _LOAN POLICIES._
H01 1160  1       SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers,
H01 1160 10    small business pools, wholesalers, retailers, service
H01 1170  6    establishments and other small businesses (when financing
H01 1180  6    is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms),
H01 1190  4    are to finance business construction, conversion, or
H01 1200  2    expansion; the purchase of equipment, facilities, machinery,
H01 1210  1    supplies, or materials; or to supply working capital.
H01 1210  9    Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable
H01 1220  7    must be provided.
H01 1230  1    _TYPES OF LOANS._
H01 1230  3       SBA business loans are of two types: "participation"
H01 1240  1    and "direct". Participation loans are those made jointly
H01 1250  1    by the SBA and banks or other private lending institutions.
H01 1250 11    Direct loans are those made by SBA alone. To qualify
H01 1260 10    for either type of loan, an applicant must be a small
H01 1270 10    business or approved small business "pool" and must
H01 1280  5    meet certain credit requirements. A small business
H01 1290  2    is defined as one which is independently owned and
H01 1290 11    operated and which is not dominant in its field. In
H01 1300 10    addition, the SBA uses such criteria as number of
H01 1310  7    employees and dollar volume of the business.
H01 1320  1    _CREDIT REQUIREMENTS._
H01 1320  3       The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant
H01 1330  3    must have the ability to operate the business successfully
H01 1340  1    and have enough capital in the business so that, with
H01 1340 11    loan assistance from the SBA, it will be able to operate
H01 1350 10    on a sound financial basis. A proposed loan must be
H01 1360  7    for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so as to
H01 1370  5    assure a reasonable chance of repayment. The record
H01 1380  1    of past earnings and prospects for the future must
H01 1380 10    indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of
H01 1390  8    current and anticipated income.
H01 1400  1    _LOAN AMOUNT._
H01 1400  2       The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends
H01 1410  2    on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose
H01 1410 13    of the loan. The maximum loan which SBA may make to
H01 1420 10    any one borrower is $350,000. Business loans generally
H01 1430  6    are repayable in regular installments- usually monthly,
H01 1440  5    including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent per
H01 1450  2    annum on the unpaid balance- and have a maximum maturity
H01 1460  1    of 10 years; the term of loans for working capital
H01 1460 11    is 6 years.

H01 1580  1    _TO COOPERATIVES_
H01 1580  1       The Farm Credit Administration, an independent agency
H01 1590  1    located within the Department of Agriculture, supervises
H01 1590  8    and coordinates a cooperative credit system for agriculture.
H01 1600  7    The system is composed of three credit services, Federal
H01 1610  6    Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations, Federal
H01 1620  4    Intermediate (short-term) Credit Banks, and Banks for
H01 1630  4    Cooperatives. This system provides long- and short-term
H01 1640  1    credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing,
H01 1640  8    purchasing, and business service organizations.
H01 1650  5       As a source of investment capital, the system is
H01 1660  5    beneficial to local communities and encourages the
H01 1670  2    development of industries in rural areas. The credit
H01 1670 10    provdied by the first two services in the system outlined
H01 1680 10    above is primarily for general agricultural purposes.
H01 1690  4    The third credit service, Banks for Cooperatives, exists
H01 1700  3    under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933. The
H01 1710  2    Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide
H01 1710  9    a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers'
H01 1720 10    cooperatives.
H01 1730  1    _TYPES OF LOANS._
H01 1730  3       Three distinct classes of loans are made available
H01 1740  1    to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives:
H01 1740  9    Commodity loans, operating capital loans, and facility
H01 1750  7    loans.
H01 1760  1    _ELIGIBILITY._
H01 1760  1       To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives,
H01 1760 11    a cooperative must be an association in which farmers
H01 1770  8    act together in processing and marketing farm products,
H01 1780  5    purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing farm business
H01 1790  3    services, and must meet the requirements set forth
H01 1800  1    in the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended.
H01 1800 10    _INTEREST RATES._
H01 1810  1       Interest rates are determined by the board of directors
H01 1810 10    of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration.
H01 1820  8    _CONTACT_

H01 1890  8    #MINERALS EXPLORATION#
H01 1900  2    To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals,
H01 1910  1    the Office of Minerals Exploration (OME) of the U.S.
H01 1920  1    Department of the Interior offers financial assistance
H01 1920  8    to firms and individuals who desire to explore their
H01 1930  8    properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral
H01 1940  8    commodities listed in the OME regulations.
H01 1950  1    _REQUIREMENTS_
H01 1950  2       This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily
H01 1960  1    would not undertake the exploration under present conditions
H01 1960  9    or circumstances at their sole expense and who are
H01 1970  9    unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable
H01 1980  6    terms. Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient
H01 1990  6    interest in the property to be explored. The Government
H01 2000  3    will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up
H01 2010  1    to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work
H01 2010 11    as it progresses. The applicant pays the rest of the
H01 2020  8    cost, but his own time spent on the work and charges
H01 2030  4    for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied
H01 2040  1    toward his share of the cost.
H01 2040  7    _REPAYMENT_
H01 2040  8       Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by
H01 2050  6    a royalty on production from the property. If nothing
H01 2060  3    is produced, there is no obligation to repay. A 5-percent
H01 2070  1    royalty is paid on any production during the period
H01 2070 10    the contract is in effect; if the Government certifies
H01 2080  8    that production may be possible from the property,
H01 2090  5    the royalty obligation continues for the 10-year period
H01 2100  4    usually specified in the contract or until the Government's
H01 2110  1    contribution is repaid with interest. The royalty applies
H01 2110  9    to both principal and interest, but it never exceeds
H01 2120  9    5 percent.
