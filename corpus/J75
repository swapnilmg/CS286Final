J75 0010  1    Furthermore, it has made an exact assessment of the
J75 0010 10    removal mechanisms possible.
J75 0020  2       The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially
J75 0030  2    of a hard, sharp, tungsten carbide knife which is pushed
J75 0040  1    along the substrate to remove the coating. The force
J75 0040 10    required to accomplish removal is plotted, by means
J75 0050  6    of an electronic recorder, against distance of removal.
J75 0060  4    Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness,
J75 0070  2    a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated
J75 0070  9    into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness.
J75 0080  8    This, too, is recorded against distance by a repeat
J75 0090  7    run over the same track previously cut. A number of
J75 0100  5    adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer
J75 0110  1    to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal
J75 0110  8    of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and
J75 0120  7    other metals, glass, wood, and plastic surfaces. The
J75 0130  4    measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily
J75 0140  1    be carried out.
J75 0140  4       Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently
J75 0150  2    with manual knife scratching tests. The instrumental
J75 0160  1    method, however, is about 100 times more sensitive
J75 0160  9    and yields numerical results which can be accurately
J75 0170  6    repeated at wil over a period of time. If a wedge-shaped
J75 0180  5    coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate
J75 0190  3    by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of
J75 0190 13    constant rake angle, a number of removal mechanisms
J75 0200  8    are often observed which depend upon the thickness
J75 0210  6    of the coating. At low thicknesses a cutting (or shearing)
J75 0220  4    phenomenon is often encountered. As the coating becomes
J75 0230  2    thicker, the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking
J75 0230 11    type of failure. If the coating becomes still thicker,
J75 0240  8    a peeling type failure finally can occur. The typical
J75 0250  6    appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated
J75 0260  3    in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, which are single frame enlargements
J75 0270  1    of high speed movies taken during the course of the
J75 0270 11    knife removal process. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that
J75 0280 10    the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate
J75 0290  7    involves pure cohesive failure of the coating. The
J75 0300  3    molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate
J75 0300 11    are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of
J75 0310  8    the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane
J75 0320  8    starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the
J75 0330  5    coating surface.
J75 0330  7       The pictures of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking
J75 0340  5    and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached
J75 0350  3    by failure in a region at, or close to, the interface
J75 0350 14    between coating and substrate.
J75 0360  4       If the force required to remove the coatings is
J75 0370  3    plotted against film thickness, a graph as illustrated
J75 0370 11    schematically in Fig. 5 may characteristically result.
J75 0380  7    Here, H is the coatings removal force measured parallel
J75 0390  8    to the surface of the substrate and t is the film
J75 0400  7    thickness. It can be seen that the force is characteristic
J75 0410  5    of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting
J75 0420  3    to cracking to peeling removal. Also, it can be readily
J75 0430  1    seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure
J75 0430 10    show a steady state response, while the cracking mechanism
J75 0440  6    is of a dynamic nature.
J75 0450  1       It should be recalled that these three mechanisms
J75 0450  9    can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same
J75 0460  7    substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings
J75 0470  4    thickness. Presumably the interfacial bond strength
J75 0480  1    and gross cohesive properties are identical in each
J75 0480  9    case. What then, are the factors that contribute to
J75 0490  7    these phenomena? Why should the "practical adhesion"
J75 0500  4    of a coating as assessed by a knife method change,
J75 0510  2    initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing
J75 0510  9    stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced
J75 0520 10    through a coating of increasing thickness?
J75 0530  2    #CUTTING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE#
J75 0530  7    The cutting (or shearing) removal process has been
J75 0540  8    previously described. It was found that the coating
J75 0550  7    is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive
J75 0560  3    failure. The details of the removal process are shown
J75 0570  1    schematically in Fig. 6. The various forces result
J75 0570  9    from the reaction of the removed paint chip against
J75 0580  7    the face of the knife and along the shear plane, which
J75 0590  5    makes an angle |f with the substrate. The action and
J75 0600  3    reaction forces are R and **f, respectively and are
J75 0610  2    equal and opposite in direction. All the other force
J75 0610 11    vectors are derived from these. **f is the force required
J75 0620  9    to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate.
J75 0630  5    **f is the shear force along the shear plane; **f and
J75 0640  4    **f are the thrust forces acting against coating and
J75 0650  2    knife, respectively; **f is the normal compressive
J75 0650  9    force acting on the shear plane; **f is the friction
J75 0660  9    force between chip and knife surfaces, and P is the
J75 0670  6    normal force acting on the face of the knife. |a is
J75 0680  4    the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle the shear
J75 0690  3    plane makes with the substrate; |t is the friction
J75 0700  1    angle; and |b is the angle the resultants make with
J75 0700 11    the plane of the substrate.
J75 0710  3       An analysis of the vector relationships shows that
J75 0720  2    the rake angle |a and the friction angle |t determine
J75 0730  1    the vector direction **f of the force resultants R
J75 0730 10    and **f. Consequently, both the rake angle of the knife
J75 0740  8    as well as the friction occurring between the back
J75 0750  5    of the removed coating and the front of the knife will
J75 0760  3    determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the
J75 0760 12    cutting removal process.
J75 0770  3       It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude
J75 0780  3    of R directly. In actual practice, the values most
J75 0790  1    readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force
J75 0790  9    **f and the shear angle |f. These two values and the
J75 0800  9    rake angle |a are sufficient to determine the other
J75 0810  6    parameters of these relationships. |a is defined by
J75 0820  5    the geometry of the knife; |f can readily be determined
J75 0830  3    by measuring the thickness of the coating before and
J75 0830 12    after cutting from the substrate; **f is instrumentally
J75 0840  8    determined. From Fig. 6 the relationship between these
J75 0850  7    parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force
J75 0860  6    is **f where |l is the shear strength of the coating
J75 0870  4    and is a parameter of the coatings material, w is
J75 0880  2    the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness.
J75 0890  1       If the cutting force, **f is plotted against film
J75 0890 10    thickness, a straight line should result passing through
J75 0900  8    the origin and having slope **f. However, in the actual
J75 0910  6    assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods
J75 0920  2    for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects
J75 0930  1    occur which must be taken into account and which make
J75 0930 11    the measured value larger than the true cutting force
J75 0940  8    indicated by eqn. (1).
J75 0950  1    #BLUNT KNIFE#
J75 0950  3    One of these is the fact that the knife employed, no
J75 0960  1    matter how well sharpened, will have a slightly rounded
J75 0960 10    cutting edge. This signifies that |a, the rake angle,
J75 0970  8    is no longer a constant to zero film thickness. The
J75 0980  6    curvature of this bluntness is, in the case of the
J75 0990  4    Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer, determined
J75 0990 11    by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten
J75 1000 11    carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body
J75 1010  7    and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil.
J75 1020  2       The force vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be
J75 1030  1    applied to this condition also. Because the rake angle
J75 1030 10    **f at the tip of the knife is very much smaller (or
J75 1040  9    even negative) when compared to the value of |a for
J75 1050  7    the major portion of the knife, a very rapid increase
J75 1060  2    in cutting force with thickness will result. This reduces
J75 1070  1    to the relationship: **f where **f is the intercept
J75 1070 10    at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope
J75 1080  7    indicated in eqn. (1), **f is the thickness of the
J75 1090  4    coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife
J75 1100  1    tip, **f is a straight line first approximation of
J75 1100 10    this roundness, and the other symbols are equivalent
J75 1110  6    to those of eqn. (1). It can be seen that **f is a
J75 1120  6    constant, and is determined for the most part by the
J75 1130  1    geometry of the knife. The blunter the knife, the higher
J75 1130 11    is the value of **f. The importance of a hard, abrasion
J75 1140  9    resistant knife material like the Carboloy employed
J75 1150  5    in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent. Softer
J75 1160  3    knives would blunt very rapidly, making the value of
J75 1170  1    **f inexact. In extreme cases of very soft knives this
J75 1170 11    value may even change during the course of a measurement.
J75 1180  8    #KNIFE FRICTION#
J75 1180 10    A second factor which enters into the practical measurement
J75 1190  8    of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the
J75 1200  6    frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife
J75 1210  7    against the substrate. This is not a constant value
J75 1220  2    like **f, but varies with the thickness of the coating
J75 1220 12    and the direction and magnitude of the resultants R
J75 1230  8    and **f of Fig. 6. Under equilibrium conditions of
J75 1240  6    cutting the chip exerts a thrust **f against the knife
J75 1250  5    which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it
J75 1260  3    away from the substrate depending on the vector direction
J75 1260 12    of **f. The resultant friction force, **f is thus directly
J75 1270  9    proportional to **f and consequently also to film thickness.
J75 1280  8       The value of **f can readily be assessed by determining
J75 1290  7    the frictional force exerted on the knife while running
J75 1300  6    over the previously stripped coating track under various
J75 1310  3    external loadings. A straight line relationship is
J75 1310 10    usually observed in a plot of **f against load L,
J75 1320 10    having slope k, and **f Since the load L, under actual
J75 1330  9    cutting conditions is caused by **f, it can be seen
J75 1340  9    that **f
J75 1340 11       The measured force, H, in cutting removal of coatings
J75 1350  7    from their substrates consequently can be seen to be
J75 1360  6    the sum of that force required to cut the coating,
J75 1370  2    **f that due to the bluntness of the knife, **f, and
J75 1370 13    that due to the friction between the bottom of the
J75 1380  9    knife and the substrate, **f, or **f The first two
J75 1390  6    forces are directly interrelated and depend upon film
J75 1400  3    thickness, whereas **f is independent of these two
J75 1400 11    and is a constant for a given knife/coating combination.
J75 1410  7       These theoretical relationships are more clearly
J75 1420  5    illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to
J75 1430  6    correlate in form with practical measurements made
J75 1440  1    with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion
J75 1440 10    of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism.
J75 1450  5    #CHIPPING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE#
J75 1455  1    Although a large number of coatings systems, particularly
J75 1460  2    at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism,
J75 1470  1    frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also
J75 1470 10    take place. This is a chipping, dynamic type failure
J75 1480  8    encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very
J75 1490  5    highly pigmented films. This is shown in the photomicrograph
J75 1500  3    of Fig. 8.
J75 1500  6       The basic difference between the continuous cutting
J75 1510  4    mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that
J75 1520  3    instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of
J75 1520 12    the knife continuously without fracture, rupture intermittently
J75 1530  5    occurs along the shear plane. The detailed mechanisms
J75 1540  6    of this type of failure have been studied extensively
J75 1550  3    by MERCHANT for metal cutting, and the principles found
J75 1560  2    can be directly applied to coatings.
J75 1560  8       By studying high speed movies made of this type
J75 1570  8    of failure, the sequence of relationships as schematically
J75 1580  3    illustrated in Fig. 9 could be observed.
J75 1590  1       In the first picture (9a) the knife is just beginning
J75 1590 11    to advance into the inclined surface which was left
J75 1600  8    from the previous chip formation. In the next, the
J75 1610  6    shear plane angle is high, and extends to the inclined
J75 1620  3    work surface. With increasing advance of the knife
J75 1620 11    into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings
J75 1630 10    surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases. Eventually,
J75 1640  5    rupture occurs along the shear plane (9e), and the
J75 1650  5    cycle repeats itself.
J75 1650  8       MERCHANT has found that the same basic relationships
J75 1660  8    which describe the geometry and force systems in the
J75 1670  6    case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to
J75 1680  3    the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper
J75 1680 10    values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous
J75 1690  7    chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used. Consequently,
J75 1700  5    if the shear angle |f is replaced by the rupture angle
J75 1710  7    **f, the relationships as described in eqns. (1), (2),
J75 1720  4    (4), and (6) will directly apply.
J75 1720 10    #THE CRACKING MECHANISM#
J75 1730  2    Under equilibrium cutting conditions, the chip exerts
J75 1730  9    a force **f against the coating and an equal opposite
J75 1740 10    force **f against the knife in the plane of the substrate
J75 1750  9    as shown in Fig. 6. If the rake angle |a of the knife
J75 1760  7    is high enough and the friction angle |t between the
J75 1770  4    front of the knife and the back of the chip is low
J75 1780  1    enough to give a positive value for **f, the resultant
J75 1780 11    vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate.
