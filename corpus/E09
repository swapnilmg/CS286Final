E09 0010  1    #ORLANDO, FLA., FEB. 2#
E09 0010  5    - The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben
E09 0020  5    White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland
E09 0030  1    Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was
E09 0040  1    clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening, Milwaukee,
E09 0050  1    Wis., who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly
E09 0050 10    proud of her.
E09 0060  1       Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby
E09 0070  1    Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36;
E09 0080  1    Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre
E09 0081  1    Hanover (Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle
E09 0090 11    Byrd) in 2:34h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in
E09 0100  8    type and conformation- good body, plenty of heart girth,
E09 0110  9    stands straight on his legs on excellent feet- and
E09 0120  5    has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind most of
E09 0130  3    the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can
E09 0130 14    show about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows
E09 0140 11    improvement with each work-out and looks the makings
E09 0150  7    of a good brood mare after winning her share of races.
E09 0160  4       Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 2:34h,
E09 0170  2    looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay),
E09 0180  1    Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess
E09 0190  1    Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled
E09 0190 10    their best work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper
E09 0200  9    worked in 2:35h and did it with ease. They are two
E09 0210  7    good colts of different type. Fury is upstanding and
E09 0220  3    on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type.
E09 0230  1    I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know
E09 0230 13    nothing but 'trot' and keeps trying a little harder
E09 0240  8    if asked to do so. Fury has made a few mistakes but
E09 0250  7    looks like a wonderful prospect, with his impressive
E09 0260  2    gait and stride which certainly make him cover the
E09 0260 11    ground.
E09 0270  1       Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile
E09 0270  9    in 2:33.3h. It took this colt several weeks to strike
E09 0280  9    a pace. Then, after emasculation, he was eased up for
E09 0290  7    a couple of weeks. He has thrived on all he has gone
E09 0300  6    through and looks the makings of a good little race
E09 0310  1    horse.
E09 0310  2       Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful
E09 0320  1    looking prospect and another good individual, with
E09 0320  8    solid, rugged conformation, good, flat bone and excellent
E09 0330  6    feet. This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November,
E09 0340  6    and immediately was put into harness and line-driven
E09 0350  4    for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in
E09 0360  1    very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared
E09 0360  9    in the hopples about November 14, was treated for worms
E09 0370  7    on the 18th, the latter date being the first time he
E09 0380  5    struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile in
E09 0390  2    2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all
E09 0390 12    the way. This colt has done everything asked of him,
E09 0400  9    and done it with ease. His best mile to date is 2:32.2h.
E09 0410  7       Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka Hanover) is another promising
E09 0420  5    colt, and his best time is 2:32.2h. This is one of
E09 0430  5    the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center. The
E09 0440  2    first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle
E09 0440 12    old mare; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old
E09 0450 10    stuff. The fourth time in harness he walked off like
E09 0460  6    a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has delayed
E09 0470  2    his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much
E09 0470 14    as any in the big Simpson stable.
E09 0480  6       Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin) is a playful bay rascal
E09 0490  6    of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely can pace
E09 0500  3    and is right there with them, and sometimes leading
E09 0500 12    them, in the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze
E09 0510  8    On Hal) is a very rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful
E09 0520  8    stride who has done with ease everything asked of him.
E09 0530  5    His best time is around 2:33.
E09 0540  1       Strongheart (Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel
E09 0540  8    colt, knows nothing but pace and has been right there
E09 0550  8    in the best miles. Torrid Adios (Torrid-Adios Molly)
E09 0560  4    is not so masculine as most of the colts, but I like
E09 0570  4    his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited
E09 0570 15    pacers on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid
E09 0580  9    off three weeks, he is coming along fine and looks
E09 0590  6    like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco Flyer-Castle
E09 0600  3    Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois
E09 0610  1    Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2h.
E09 0610  7       The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything
E09 0620  6    on the fillies, especially the pacers. Justine Hanover
E09 0630  4    (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is improving with
E09 0640  3    each work-out and paced 2:32.4h weeks ago.
E09 0650  1       Mrs. Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise
E09 0650  9    and does it in good form, and her best time is about
E09 0660 10    2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover), a filly that
E09 0670  5    wanted to trot, knocked herself October 31 and November
E09 0680  4    1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on the
E09 0690  2    trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart
E09 0690 11    once around the half-mile track and hoppled again.
E09 0700  7    This time she submitted and in a few days was going
E09 0710  6    good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38h;
E09 0720  1    on Jan. 18 2:37.3-:36.1h; on Jan. 21, 2:36. This filly
E09 0730  3    is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters,
E09 0740  1    Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better
E09 0740 10    underpinning. She is more like her full brother, Taraday
E09 0750  9    Hanover, but larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking
E09 0760 10    filly.
E09 0760 11       Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers.
E09 0770  8    Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan) seems to be
E09 0780  5    the pick of the stable at the present time. He is a
E09 0790  4    fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs
E09 0790 15    and nice way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33.
E09 0800 11    Majestic Pick comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2.
E09 0810  8    This colt is another fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover
E09 0820  6    (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover) is a little on the
E09 0830  6    small side but a very compact colt and looks like one
E09 0840  3    to stand training and many future battles with colts
E09 0840 12    in his class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside
E09 0850 10    (Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the
E09 0860  8    half-mile track and shows promise.
E09 0870  2       Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked
E09 0880  1    from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary)
E09 0880 11    has gone in 2:36h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty
E09 0890  9    Hanover) in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly
E09 0900 11    she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance
E09 0910  8    that I said to myself, "that must be Hickory Ash".
E09 0920  5    She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot. Hickory
E09 0930  2    Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33h;
E09 0940  1    Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37h; Buxton
E09 0950  1    Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy
E09 0960  1    (Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor
E09 0970  1    Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking,
E09 0970 11    large colt, who has been unfortunate to be laid off
E09 0980  9    for some time due to injuries. He is going sound again
E09 0990  6    now, and looks good.
E09 0990 10       Brief Candle (Harlan-Marcia) has gone in 2:37h;
E09 1000  7    Lena Faber (Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena) 2:33h; Martha
E09 1010  4    Rodney (Rodney-Miss Martha D.) 2:35h; Checkit (Faber
E09 1020  5    Hanover-Supermarket) 2:35h; Charm Rodney (Rodney-The
E09 1030  5    Charmer) 2:37h; Fair Sail (Farvel-Topsy Herring) 2:36h;
E09 1040  6    Custom Maid (Knight Dream-Way Dream) 2:34.2h; Jacky
E09 1050  4    Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess Lorraine) 2:36h; Good
E09 1060  4    Flying (Good Time-Olivette Hanover) 2:36h; Bordner
E09 1070  3    Hanover (Tar Heel-Betty Mahone) 2:34; Faber's Choice
E09 1080  3    (Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet) 2:36h; Invercalt
E09 1090  2    (Florican-Inverness) 2:35h; Duffy Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess
E09 1100  4    Mite) 2:36h; Harold J. (Worthy Boy-Lady Scotland)
E09 1110  2    2:36; Knightfall (Knight Dream-Miss Worthy Grapes)
E09 1120  2    2:36h; Next Knight (Knight Dream-Next Time) 2:36h;
E09 1130  1    Trader Jet (Florican-My Precious) 2:37h; Trader Rich
E09 1140  2    (Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover) 2:37h; Good Little Girl
E09 1150  2    (Good Time-Mynah Hanover) 2:36h; Iosola Hanover (Kimberly
E09 1160  1    Kid-Isoletta Hanover) 2:36h. The last-named is one
E09 1170  1    of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her
E09 1170 12    very much. I will be able to tell you more about this
E09 1180  9    string of equines in the near future.
E09 1190  1       I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a
E09 1190 11    mile in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away
E09 1200 10    Debonnie got behind several lengths, stalling at the
E09 1210  6    start- she is a little fussy. They left the three-quarters
E09 1220  5    together and finished almost together. Prompt Time
E09 1230  2    shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants
E09 1230 11    to trot, and trot she did until forced to do otherwise.
E09 1240 10    After well broken and equipped with 12oz shoes on
E09 1250  7    behind, bare-footed in front, she would trot a real
E09 1260  5    storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed
E09 1270  1    in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated,
E09 1270 10    she hopped, she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped,
E09 1280  8    but in some two weeks she started to pace, From that
E09 1290  6    time to this she has shown steady improvement and now
E09 1300  3    looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.
E09 1300 13       Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there
E09 1310  9    were a few miles of note on Thursday. Those responsible
E09 1330  3    included Stardel Hanover (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover),
E09 1340  5    2:30-:34.3; Lorena Gallon (Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover),
E09 1350  5    2:30-:34.3; Prudent Hanover (Dean Hanover-Precious
E09 1360  4    Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Premium Freight (Titan Hanover-Pebble
E09 1370  5    Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Laguerre Hanover (Tar Heel-Lotus
E09 1380  5    Hanover), 2:30.3-:36.1; Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd),
E09 1390  5    2:30.3-:36.1; Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay), 2:30.3-:36;
E09 1400  5    Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; Caper
E09 1410  4    (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; Lucky Freight
E09 1420  3    (Knight Dream-Lusty Helen), 2:31.3-:35.3.
E09 1430  1       Sam Caton's Butterwyn (Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn),
E09 1440  1    a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked
E09 1440 12    on the half-mile in 2:30-:36. Riverboat (Dalzell-Cousin
E09 1450  7    Rachel) has gone in 2:38h. Sam is having his troubles
E09 1460  7    with Layton Hanover (Dean Hanover-Lucy Hanover), but
E09 1470  5    hope to have him straightened out and going before
E09 1480  2    long.
E09 1480  3       Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet (Adios-Rena
E09 1490  1    Grattan) and she sure looks good as she goes by. Her
E09 1490 12    best time to date is about 2:30h. He also likes Hampton
E09 1500 11    Hanover (Titan Hanover-Bertie Hanover) 2:37h. Cathy
E09 1510  6    J. Hanover (Tar Heel-Kaola Hanover), formerly called
E09 1520  6    Karet Hanover, has been rather a problem child, but
E09 1530  5    it getting better all the while and can pace a twice
E09 1540  3    around in about 2:31. Armbro Comet (Nibble Hanover-Mauri
E09 1550  1    Hanover) has been in 2:38.
E09 1550  6       Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's Miss Phone (Galophone-Prissy
E09 1560  5    Miss) is a fine-looking filly with good disposition
E09 1570  4    and good gait, and she has worked up to date in 2:46.
E09 1580  1    #DEL MAR, CALIF., FEB. 3#
E09 1580  6    - After 52 rainless days, moisture finally came to
E09 1590  6    Del Mar, resulting in but one workout during the week
E09 1600  4    for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than
E09 1610  1    half our total average rainfall during the season.
E09 1610  9       While 2-year-olds are still gaining most of the
E09 1620  7    attention at the track, green horses are starting to
E09 1630  5    go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that can really
E09 1640  3    make it. Work-outs for the week are as follows: Plain
E09 1650  1    Scotch, 3 (by Scotch Victor), Demon Law, 3 (by Demon
E09 1650 11    Hanover), Coffee Royal, p (by Royal Blackstone) and

E09 1720  1    aged horses: Mr. Budlong, p, 2:00.2h, Lottie Thomas,
E09 1720  9    p, 2:04.2h, Mighty Signal 2:03, Clever Braden, p,
E09 1730  8    2:01.1h, and Glow Star, p, 2:02.3 have been in 2:35;
E09 1740 10    Miss Demon Abbe, p, 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26, and
E09 1750 10    is expected to race at this gait; Carter Creed, p,
E09 1760  8    3, 2:01.1, Great Lullwater 2:00.3, and Hi Jay, p,
E09 1770  6    2:05.1h have been in 2:30; Tanker T., 3, 2:05.3 is

E09 1810  3    Fire, 4, 2:02.2 have been in 2:25; Maria Key, 2, 2:06h
E09 1820  2    looked great in 2:22; Mocking Byrd, p, 2:01.1h has
E09 1830  2    been in 2:12, with a racing date approaching at Bay
E09 1830 12    Meadows.
E09 1840  1       Dewey Urban has a clever green trotter in Dr. Orin
E09 1840 11    I., 3 (by Yankee Hanover), his latest mile in 2:20;
E09 1850 10    Victory Sun, p, 2:04 has trained in 2:24; Early Sun,
