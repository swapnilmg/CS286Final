G02 0010  1       In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry
G02 0010 12    Maine noted long ago, were only two in number: internal
G02 0020  9    order and external security. By prevailing over other
G02 0030  5    claimants for the loyalties of men, the nation-state
G02 0040  4    maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order
G02 0050  1    within its territorial borders. Outside those limits
G02 0050  8    it asserted, as against other states, a position of
G02 0060  7    sovereign equality, and, as against the "inferior"
G02 0070  3    peoples of the non-Western world, a position of dominance.
G02 0080  2    It became the sole "subject" of "international law"
G02 0090  1    (a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined
G02 0090 11    by Bentham), a body of legal principle which by and
G02 0100  9    large was made up of what Western nations could do
G02 0110  4    in the world arena. (That corpus of law was a reflection
G02 0120  2    of the power system in existence during the eighteenth
G02 0120 11    and nineteenth centuries. Speaking generally, it furthered-
G02 0130  7    and still tends to further- the interests of the Western
G02 0140  9    powers. The enormous changes in world politics have,
G02 0150  6    however, thrown it into confusion, so much so that
G02 0160  4    it is safe to say that all international law is now
G02 0160 15    in need of reexamination and clarification in light
G02 0170  8    of the social conditions of the present era.)
G02 0180  5       Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above, no attention
G02 0190  4    was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state
G02 0200  1    responsibility, either internally or externally. This
G02 0200  7    was particularly true in the world arena, which was
G02 0210  8    an anarchical battleground characterized by strife
G02 0220  3    and avaricious competition for colonial empires. That
G02 0230  2    any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations
G02 0230 14    would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.
G02 0240  6    His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation, and
G02 0250  6    an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries
G02 0260  2    was not to be contemplated. Thus, to cite but one example,
G02 0270  2    the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century, whether
G02 0270 10    with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City
G02 0280 11    of London ruling world finance, was strictly national
G02 0290  6    in motivation, however much other nations (e.g., the
G02 0300  4    United States) may have incidentally benefited. At
G02 0310  2    the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal
G02 0320  1    responsibility existed for the welfare of the people
G02 0320  9    within the territorial state was strongly resisted.
G02 0330  5    Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient
G02 0340  4    socialist movement until well into the present century.
G02 0350  1       However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are
G02 0350  9    multiple reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily
G02 0360  7    observable shift has occurred in both facets of national
G02 0370  7    activity. A concept of responsibility is in process
G02 0380  4    of articulation and establishment. Already firmly implanted
G02 0390  2    internally, it is a growing factor in external matters.
G02 0400  1    ##
G02 0400  2    A little more than twenty years ago the American people
G02 0400 12    turned an important corner. In what has aptly been
G02 0410  9    called a "constitutional revolution", the basic nature
G02 0420  5    of government was transformed from one essentially
G02 0430  3    negative in nature (the "night-watchman state") to
G02 0440  1    one with affirmative duties to perform. The "positive
G02 0440  9    state" came into existence. For lawyers, reflecting
G02 0450  6    perhaps their parochial preferences, there has been
G02 0460  4    a special fascination since then in the role played
G02 0470  2    by the Supreme Court in that transformation- the manner
G02 0470 11    in which its decisions altered in "the switch in time
G02 0480 10    that saved nine", President Roosevelt's ill-starred
G02 0490  5    but in effect victorious "Court-packing plan", the
G02 0500  3    imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed
G02 0510  3    upon social legislation. Of greater importance, however,
G02 0520  1    is the content of those programs, which have had and
G02 0520 11    are having enormous consequences for the American people.
G02 0530  6    Labor relations have been transformed, income security
G02 0540  4    has become a standardized feature of political platforms,
G02 0550  2    and all the many facets of the American version of
G02 0560  1    the welfare state have become part of the conventional
G02 0560 10    wisdom. A national consensus of near unanimity exists
G02 0570  6    that these governmental efforts are desirable as well
G02 0580  5    as necessary. Ratified in the Republican Party victory
G02 0590  2    in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political
G02 0600  1    campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much
G02 0600 11    social legislation there should be.
G02 0610  5       The general acceptance of the idea of governmental
G02 0620  3    (i.e., societal) responsibility for the economic well-being
G02 0630  3    of the American people is surely one of the two most
G02 0630 14    significant watersheds in American constitutional history.
G02 0640  6    The other, of course, was the Civil War, the conflict
G02 0650  8    which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation.
G02 0660  5    A third, one of at least equal and perhaps even greater
G02 0670  4    importance, is now being traversed: American immersion
G02 0680  2    and involvement in world affairs.
G02 0680  7       Internal national responsibility, now a truism,
G02 0690  5    need not be documented. Nevertheless, it may be helpful
G02 0700  5    to cite one example- that of employment- for, as will
G02 0710  2    be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new
G02 0710 13    concept. Thirty years ago, while the nation was wallowing
G02 0720  8    in economic depression, the prevailing philosophy of
G02 0730  5    government was to stand aside and allow "natural forces"
G02 0740  3    to operate and cure the distress. That guiding principle
G02 0750  2    of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns
G02 0750 11    of the New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress
G02 0760 11    enacted the Employment Act of 1946, by which the national
G02 0770  9    government assumed the responsibility of taking action
G02 0780  5    to insure conditions of maximum employment. Hands-off
G02 0790  3    the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through
G02 0800  1    planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution.
G02 0800  8    In 1961 the first important legislative victory of
G02 0810  8    the Kennedy Administration came when the principle
G02 0820  5    of national responsibility for local economic distress
G02 0830  3    won out over a "state's-responsibility" proposal- provision
G02 0840  2    was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide
G02 0850  4    taxation rather than by a levy only on those states
G02 0850 14    afflicted with manpower surplus. The American people
G02 0860  7    have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between
G02 0870  9    1930 and 1961.
G02 0870 12       Internal national responsibility is a societal response
G02 0880  7    to the impact of the Industrial Revolution. Reduced
G02 0890  4    to its simplest terms, it is an assumption of a collective
G02 0900  4    duty to compensate for the inability of individuals
G02 0910  1    to cope with the rigors of the era. National responsibility
G02 0910 11    for individual welfare is a concept not limited to
G02 0920  9    the United States or even to the Western nations. A
G02 0930  7    measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived
G02 0940  4    from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists
G02 0950  1    in 1959. Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of
G02 0950 11    the International Commission of Jurists, a body of
G02 0960  7    lawyers from the free world, the Congress redefined
G02 0970  4    and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include
G02 0980  3    affirmative governmental duties. It is noteworthy that
G02 0990  1    the majority of the delegates to the Congress were
G02 0990 10    from the less developed, former colonial nations. The
G02 1000  5    Rule of Law, historically a principle according everyone
G02 1010  3    his "day in court" before an impartial tribunal, was
G02 1020  2    broadened substantively by making it a responsibility
G02 1020  9    of government to promote individual welfare. Recognizing
G02 1030  7    that the Rule of Law is "a dynamic concept ... which
G02 1040  9    should be employed not only to safeguard the civil
G02 1050  5    and political rights of the individual in a free society",
G02 1060  2    the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility
G02 1070  1    "to establish social, economic, educational and cultural
G02 1070  8    conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and
G02 1080  7    dignity may be realized". The idea of national responsibility
G02 1090  6    thus has become a common feature of the nations of
G02 1100  6    the non-Soviet world. For better or for worse, we all
G02 1110  3    now live in welfare states, the organizing principle
G02 1110 11    of which is collective responsibility for individual
G02 1120  6    well-being.
G02 1120  8       Whether a concept analogous to the principle of
G02 1130  8    internal responsibility operates in a nation's external
G02 1140  6    relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish.
G02 1150  4    The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, and that
G02 1160  3    evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.
G02 1160  9    The content is not the same, however: rather than individual
G02 1170  9    security, it is the security and continuing existence
G02 1180  7    of an "ideological group"- those in the "free world"-
G02 1190  8    that is basic. External national responsibility involves
G02 1200  3    a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western
G02 1210  3    nations so guide their decisions as to further the
G02 1210 12    viability of other friendly nations. If internal responsibility
G02 1220  8    suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality,
G02 1230  7    then external responsibility implies adherence to principles
G02 1240  5    of ideological supranationalism.
G02 1250  1       Reference to two other concepts- nationalism and
G02 1250  8    sovereignty- may help to reveal the contours of the
G02 1260 11    new principle. In its beginnings the nation-state had
G02 1270  5    to struggle to assert itself- internally, against feudal
G02 1280  3    groups, and externally, against the power and influence
G02 1290  1    of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church.
G02 1290 10    The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall
G02 1300  8    of feudalism led, not more than two centuries ago,
G02 1310  5    to the surge of nationalism. (Since the time-span of
G02 1320  2    the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate
G02 1320 10    existence of the United States as an independent entity,
G02 1330  9    it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the
G02 1340  7    nation as representative of the highest form of order,
G02 1350  4    something permanent and unchanging.) The concept of
G02 1360  1    nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes
G02 1360  8    and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic
G02 1370  7    type of socal structure. But it is more than that.
G02 1380  6    For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to
G02 1390  3    their homeland and the complex motivations that hold
G02 1390 11    a large group of people together as a unit. Today,
G02 1400  9    as new nations rise from the former colonial empires,
G02 1410  5    nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in
G02 1420  3    the world. Almost febrile in intensity, the principle
G02 1420 11    has become worldwide in application- unfortunately
G02 1430  6    at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak
G02 1440  5    greatest harm. Historically, however, the concept is
G02 1450  4    one that has been of marked benefit to the people of
G02 1450 15    the Western civilizational group. By subduing disparate
G02 1460  7    lesser groups the nation has, to some degree at least,
G02 1470  9    broadened the capacity for individual liberty. Within
G02 1480  3    their confines, moreover, technological and industrial
G02 1490  2    growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing
G02 1500  1    the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.
G02 1500 10    While the pattern is uneven, some having gained more
G02 1510  8    than others, nationalism has in fact served the Western
G02 1520  7    peoples well. (Whether historical nationalism helped
G02 1530  2    the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether
G02 1540  1    today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has
G02 1540  9    equally beneficial aspects, are other questions.)
G02 1550  5       It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the
G02 1560  5    viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial
G02 1570  2    state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time
G02 1570 10    that the nation-state attained its highest number (approximately
G02 1580  9    100). But it is more than irony: one of the main reasons
G02 1590 11    why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because
G02 1600  8    it has spread throughout the planet. In other words,
G02 1610  5    nationalism worked well enough when it had limited
G02 1620  2    application, both as to geography and as to population;
G02 1620 11    it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a
G02 1630  9    world-wide basis.
G02 1640  1       Complementing the political principle of nationalism
G02 1640  7    is the legal principle of sovereignty. The former receives
G02 1650  7    its legitimacy from the latter. Operating side by side,
G02 1660  6    together they helped shore up the nation-state. While
G02 1670  2    sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present
G02 1680  1    usage it is essentially modern. Jean Bodin, writing
G02 1680  9    in the sixteenth century, may have been the seminal
G02 1690  7    thinker, but it was the vastly influential John Austin
G02 1700  3    who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood.
G02 1710  2    Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty
G02 1720  1    still dominates much of today's legal and political
G02 1720  9    thinking. To him, law is the command of the sovereign
G02 1730  9    (the English monarch) who personifies the power of
G02 1740  5    the nation, while sovereignty is the power to make
G02 1750  2    law- i.e., to prevail over internal groups and to be
G02 1750 12    free from the commands of other sovereigns in other
G02 1760  9    nations. These fundamental ideas- the indivisibility
G02 1770  3    of sovereignty and its dual (internal-external) aspects-
G02 1780  1    still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political
G02 1790  2    power.
G02 1790  3       The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle
G02 1800  1    of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power
G02 1800  8    over domestic affairs and independence from outside
G02 1810  7    control. In fact, however, both principles have always
G02 1820  5    been nebulous and loosely defined. High-level abstractions
G02 1830  2    are always difficult to pin down with precision. That
G02 1840  2    is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied
G02 1840 11    to democratic societies, in which "popular" sovereignty
G02 1850  6    is said to exist, and in federal nations, in which
G02 1860  7    the jobs of government are split. Nevertheless, nationalism
G02 1870  2    and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted wisdom,
G02 1880  2    to describe the modern world. Is there a different
G02 1880 11    reality behind the facade? Does the surface hide a
G02 1890  8    quite different picture?
G02 1900  1       The short answer to those questions is "yes". Both
G02 1900 10    concepts are undergoing alteration; to some degree
G02 1910  7    they are being supplanted by a concept of national
G02 1920  6    responsibility. As evidence to support that view, consider
G02 1930  4    the following illustrative instances.
