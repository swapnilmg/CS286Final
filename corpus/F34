F34 0010  1       The soybean seed is the most important leguminous
F34 0010  9    food in the world. In the United States, where half
F34 0020  8    of the world crop is grown, soybeans are processed
F34 0030  4    for their edible oil. The residue from soybean processing
F34 0040  2    goes mainly into animal feeds.
F34 0040  7       Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable
F34 0050  5    number of food products in the Orient. American chemists,
F34 0060  3    seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have adapted
F34 0070  2    modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve
F34 0070  9    their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu
F34 0080  9    and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia. Soybean flour,
F34 0090  5    grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can be bought in the
F34 0100  5    United States.
F34 0100  7       Peanuts are the world's second most important legume.
F34 0110  5    They are used mainly for their oil. We produce peanut
F34 0120  3    oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire
F34 0120 14    seed. Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut
F34 0130  8    butter or for eating as nuts, are roasted seeds whose
F34 0140  7    seedcoats have been rubbed off.
F34 0150  1       Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry
F34 0150  8    edible peas or beans, comprise about two-thirds or
F34 0160  6    three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa.
F34 0170  4       In western Europe and North America, where the level
F34 0180  3    of economic development is higher, grains and other
F34 0180 11    seed products furnish less than one-third of the food
F34 0190 10    consumed. Rather, meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy
F34 0200  7    products are the main sources of carbohydrate, protein,
F34 0210  2    oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for foods
F34 0220  2    in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive
F34 0220 10    grazing lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption
F34 0230  9    of meat is high.
F34 0240  1       Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the
F34 0240 10    world's cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain
F34 0250 10    is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to
F34 0260  6    beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent of the corn
F34 0270  4    used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest
F34 0280  1    is used for human food and industrial products. More
F34 0280 10    than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce
F34 0290  7    and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals
F34 0300  4    and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.
F34 0310  1       More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products
F34 0310 11    are fed to livestock annually in the United States.
F34 0320  8       The efficiency with which animals convert grains
F34 0330  6    and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United
F34 0340  4    States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased
F34 0350  1    feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when
F34 0350 12    seeds are processed for oil.
F34 0360  5    ##
F34 0360  6    THE DEMAND for food is so great in the world that little
F34 0370  5    arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood
F34 0380  1    crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively
F34 0380 10    minor position.
F34 0390  2       Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial
F34 0400  1    uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung
F34 0400 10    (nuts from the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from
F34 0410  8    an Oriental mint), and oiticica (from a Brazilian tree).
F34 0420  5       Oils, or liquid fats, from the seeds of flax and
F34 0430  5    tung have long been the principal constituents of paints
F34 0440  1    and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces
F34 0440  9    of wood and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth
F34 0450  8    films when they dry and form resinlike substances.
F34 0460  3       The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to
F34 0470  3    carry the pigments and to protect his finished work
F34 0470 12    for the ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes
F34 0480 10    from poppy seeds.
F34 0490  1       Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape
F34 0490  9    yield semidrying oils. Some are used in paints along
F34 0500  8    with drying oils. Palm oil protects the surfaces of
F34 0510  5    steel sheets before they are plated with tin.
F34 0520  1       Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out
F34 0520  9    of style as a medicine. This nondrying oil, however,
F34 0530  6    is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant,
F34 0540  6    as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated
F34 0550  2    equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.
F34 0560  1       Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used
F34 0560  9    extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances.
F34 0570  7    It is still used in drugs and cosmetics, but it is
F34 0580  6    rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils
F34 0590  2    from peach and plum seeds.
F34 0590  7       Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the
F34 0600  5    manufacture of soaps for industry and the household
F34 0610  1    and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making
F34 0610 10    explosives.
F34 0620  1       Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel
F34 0620  9    oil- seed oils that are produced primarily for food
F34 0630  8    purposes- also are used to make soaps, detergents,
F34 0640  5    and paint resins.
F34 0640  8       Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree, the
F34 0650  8    shea tree, and the coconut palm are used to make candles
F34 0660  4    in tropical countries.
F34 0660  7       Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial
F34 0670  5    and food use in many parts of the world. Corn and wheat
F34 0680  4    supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada,
F34 0690  1    and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains
F34 0690  9    are not among the principal crops of a region, starchy
F34 0700  9    tubers or roots are processed for starch. Starch is
F34 0710  5    used in the paper, textile, and food-processing industries
F34 0720  2    and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.
F34 0730  1       Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort),
F34 0730  8    flax, and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today
F34 0740  9    the yearly import into the United States of locust
F34 0750  7    bean gum is more than 15 million pounds; of psyllium
F34 0760  3    seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during the
F34 0770  2    Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported
F34 0770 12    locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia
F34 0780  8    and initiated it in the United States.
F34 0790  3       Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and
F34 0800  2    in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners,
F34 0800 11    stabilizers, or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens
F34 0810  7    salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream. Quince seed
F34 0820  5    gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions.
F34 0830  2    Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium
F34 0830  9    was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under
F34 0840  9    117 different brands. Locust gum is added to pulp slurries
F34 0850  8    to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper.

F34 0860  5    THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits, called nuts,
F34 0870  3    provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other
F34 0870 10    materials of value. Most nuts consist of the richly
F34 0880  9    packaged storage kernel and its thick, adherent, brown
F34 0890  6    covering- the seedcoat.
F34 0890  9       The kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts,
F34 0900  8    hazelnuts, hickory nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine
F34 0910  6    nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds and pistachio
F34 0920  3    nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein.
F34 0930  1    Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in
F34 0930 10    protein.
F34 0940  1       The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds,
F34 0940  8    brazil nuts, filberts, and the English walnuts- totals
F34 0950  7    about 300 thousand tons annually.
F34 0960  1       Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the
F34 0960 10    largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific
F34 0970 11    islands as a crop for domestic and export markets.
F34 0980  7    The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from
F34 0990  4    both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit.
F34 1000  1    World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of
F34 1000 10    the coconut, was a little more than 3 million tons
F34 1010  9    in 1959. Exports from producing countries in terms
F34 1020  4    of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million
F34 1030  1    tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from
F34 1030 12    them and about half was palm oil.
F34 1040  5       Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the
F34 1050  2    spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing
F34 1050 11    power to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for
F34 1060  9    ink and varnish; the aromatic sassafras nut of South
F34 1070  6    America; and the sweet-smelling cumara nut, which is
F34 1080  5    suited for perfumes.
F34 1080  8       A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated
F34 1090  5    is ivory nuts from the tagua palm. The so-called vegetable
F34 1100  5    ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed.
F34 1110  2    It is used for making buttons and other small, hard
F34 1110 12    objects of turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used
F34 1120  9    in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to
F34 1130  6    tourists.
F34 1130  7    ##
F34 1130  8    THE COLOR AND SHAPE of seeds have long made them attractive
F34 1140  7    for ornaments and decorations.
F34 1150  1       Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from
F34 1150  9    jobs-tears- the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree
F34 1160 11    seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders
F34 1170  5    and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba. Victorian ladies
F34 1180  3    had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.
F34 1190  1       Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain
F34 1190  8    a variety of seeds collected during the year.
F34 1200  7       Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds
F34 1210  5    because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils, and highly
F34 1220  3    flavored components. Although science has given us
F34 1220 10    more effective materials, preparations from anise,
F34 1230  5    castorbean, colchicum, nux vomica, mustard, fennel,
F34 1240  4    and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief
F34 1250  2    of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters
F34 1250 10    still are used by some persons.
F34 1260  6       Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers
F34 1270  4    or diluents for medicines administered by injection.
F34 1280  1       Still another group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry,
F34 1290  7    seed-bearing fruits) provide distinctive flavors and
F34 1300  6    odors to foods, although the nutrients they supply
F34 1310  4    are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings,
F34 1320  1    and condiments make up this group.
F34 1320  7       Each year millions of pounds of anise, caraway,
F34 1330  5    mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils extracted
F34 1340  2    from them are imported.
F34 1340  6       Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include
F34 1350  4    several of the carrot family, such as cumin, dill,
F34 1360  2    fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking
F34 1360 11    and beverages include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor)
F34 1370  6    and cardamom. White pepper is the ground seed of the
F34 1380  8    common black pepper fruit.
F34 1390  1       Sesame seed, which comes from the tall pods of a
F34 1390 10    plant grown in Egypt, Brazil, and Central America,
F34 1400  5    has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost
F34 1410  4    any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring
F34 1410 14    for halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks,
F34 1420 10    a snack dip, originated in the Southwest.
F34 1430  5       Beverages are made from seeds the world over.
F34 1440  4       Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds
F34 1450  1    of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke
F34 1450 10    all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than
F34 1460  9    5 million tons. Per capita consumption remains around
F34 1470  3    16 pounds in the United States.
F34 1470  9       Cocoa, chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the
F34 1480  8    ground seeds of the cacao tree. World production of
F34 1490  5    about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa
F34 1500  2    (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).
F34 1510  1       Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts,
F34 1510  8    the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies
F34 1520  7    and South America.
F34 1530  1       Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare
F34 1530  9    fermented beverages. The Japanese sake is wine fermented
F34 1540  7    from rice grain. Arrack is distilled from fermented
F34 1550  4    rice in India.
F34 1550  7       Beer, generally fermented from barley, is an old
F34 1560  6    alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the Babylonians
F34 1570  2    and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers
F34 1580  1    today use corn, rice, and malted barley.
F34 1580  8       Distillers use corn, malt, wheat, grain sorghum,
F34 1590  5    and rye in making beverage alcohol.
F34 1590 11    ##
F34 1600  1    SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural
F34 1600 10    economy of the United States.
F34 1610  5       The farm value of seeds produced in this country
F34 1620  2    for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly
F34 1620 10    10 billion dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds,
F34 1630  7    and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent
F34 1640  5    of the farm value of all crops raised.
F34 1650  1       The economic importance of seed crops actually is
F34 1650  9    even greater, because additional returns are obtained
F34 1660  5    from most of the corn, oats, barley, and sorghum- as
F34 1670  4    well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed,
F34 1680  3    cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry,
F34 1690  1    meat, and dairy products.
F34 1690  5       Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients
F34 1700  4    consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the
F34 1710  1    other chief sources of livestock feed.
F34 1710  7       Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling
F34 1720  5    grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining edible oil,
F34 1730  3    brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.
F34 1730  8       More than 11 thousand business establishments in
F34 1740  5    the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds
F34 1750  4    in 1954. The value of products from these industries
F34 1760  1    was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third
F34 1760 10    was created by manufacturing processes. Not included
F34 1770  6    was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or
F34 1780  5    the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that
F34 1790  2    are based on imported seed or seed products.
F34 1790 10       Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total
F34 1800  8    food calories in the American diet and about one-third
F34 1810  6    of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and
F34 1820  2    poultry.
