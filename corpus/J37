J37 0010  1       An analysis of the election falls naturally in four
J37 0010 10    parts. First is the long and still somewhat obscure
J37 0020  8    process of preparation, planning and discussion. Preparation
J37 0030  4    began slightly more than a year after independence
J37 0040  2    with the first steps to organize rural communes. All
J37 0050  1    political interests supported electoral planning, although
J37 0050  7    there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties
J37 0060  6    of a popular judgment led to some procrastination.
J37 0070  3    The second major aspect of the election is the actual
J37 0080  2    procedure of registration, nomination and voting. Considerable
J37 0090  1    technical skill was used and the administration of
J37 0090  9    the elections was generally above reproach. However,
J37 0100  5    the regionally differentiated results, which appear
J37 0110  3    below in tables, are interesting evidence of the problems
J37 0120  1    of developing self-government under even the most favorable
J37 0120 10    circumstances. A third aspect, and probably the one
J37 0130  8    open to most controversy, is the results of the election.
J37 0140  7    The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification
J37 0150  4    of party affiliation, but all vitally interested parties,
J37 0160  2    including the government itself, were busily engaged
J37 0160  9    in determining the party identifications of all successful
J37 0170  8    candidates the month following the elections. The fourth
J37 0180  7    and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run
J37 0190  7    significance of the elections and how they figure in
J37 0200  3    the current pattern of internal politics.
J37 0200  9       Elections have figured prominently in nearly every
J37 0210  7    government program and official address since independence.
J37 0220  4    They were stressed in the speeches of Si Mubarak Bekkai
J37 0230  5    when the first Council of Ministers was formed and
J37 0240  2    again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the
J37 0240 12    second Council. King Muhammad V was known to be most
J37 0250  9    sympathetic to the formation of local self-government
J37 0260  5    and made the first firm promise of elections on May
J37 0270  3    Day, 1957. There followed a long and sometimes bitter
J37 0280  1    discussion of the feasibility of elections for the
J37 0280  9    fall of 1957, in which it appears that the Minister
J37 0290  7    of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and
J37 0300  3    that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic.
J37 0310  1    Since the complicated process of establishing new communes
J37 0310  9    and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French
J37 0320  9    did not even begin until the fall of 1957, this goal
J37 0330  8    appears somewhat ambitious.
J37 0340  1       From the very beginning the electoral discussions
J37 0340  7    raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics, precisely
J37 0350  5    the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve
J37 0360  5    in the new government. Until the Charter of Liberties
J37 0370  3    was issued in the fall of 1958, there were no guarantees
J37 0380  1    of the right to assemble or to organize for political
J37 0380 11    purposes. The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957,
J37 0390  8    but the P.D.I. (Parti Democratique de l'Independance),
J37 0400  4    the most important minor party at the time, objected
J37 0410  6    to the Istiqlal's predominance in the civil service
J37 0420  3    and influence in Radio Maroc. There were rumors that
J37 0430  1    the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary,
J37 0430  9    "non-political" process, which were indirectly affirmed
J37 0440  6    when the King personally intervened in the planned
J37 0450  4    meetings. The day following his intervention the palace
J37 0460  3    issued a statement reassuring the citizens that "...
J37 0460 11    the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the
J37 0470  7    establishment of electoral lists, lists of candidates
J37 0480  5    and finally the holding of the consultation itself
J37 0490  2    ..." would be supported by the King himself.
J37 0500  1       The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further
J37 0500 10    consideration of elections, but French consultants
J37 0510  6    were called in and notices of further investigation
J37 0520  2    appeared from time to time. In January, 1958, the Minister
J37 0530  2    of the Interior announced that an election law was
J37 0530 11    ready to be submitted to the King, the rumors of election
J37 0540 11    dates appeared once again, first for spring of 1958
J37 0550  7    and later for the summer. Although the government was
J37 0560  4    probably prepared for elections by mid-1958, the first
J37 0570  2    decision was no doubt made more difficult as party
J37 0570 11    strife multiplied. In late 1957 the M.P. (Mouvement
J37 0580  7    Populaire) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal
J37 0590  9    strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third
J37 0600  5    Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without
J37 0610  2    support from progressive elements in the party. The
J37 0610 10    parties were on the whole unprepared for elections,
J37 0620  8    while the people were still experiencing post-independence
J37 0630  5    let-down and suffering the after effects of poor harvests
J37 0640  5    in 1957.
J37 0640  7       Despite the internal and international crises that
J37 0650  3    harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue.
J37 0660  2    They figured prominently in the Balafrej government
J37 0660  9    of May, 1958, which the King was reportedly determined
J37 0670  8    to keep in office until elections could be held. But
J37 0680  6    the eagerly sought "homogeneity" of the Balafrej Council
J37 0690  5    of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled
J37 0700  2    over foreign policy, labor politics and economic development.
J37 0710  1    By December, 1958, when 'Abdallah Ibrahim became President
J37 0720  1    of the Council, elections had even greater importance.
J37 0720  9    They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing
J37 0730  9    the new rural communes as the focus of a new, constructive
J37 0740  9    national effort. To minimize the chances of repeating
J37 0750  5    the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed
J37 0760  3    a titre personnel and a special office was created
J37 0770  1    in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct
J37 0770 12    the elections. By this time there is little doubt but
J37 0780  9    what election plans were complete. There remained only
J37 0790  4    the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the
J37 0800  3    labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number
J37 0801  1    of policy decisions.
J37 0810  3       From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning
J37 0820  2    in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the
J37 0820 10    first elections in a developing country and evaluating
J37 0830  8    their results. In the new country the electoral process
J37 0840  7    is considered as a means of resolving fundamental,
J37 0850  2    and sometimes bitter, differences among leaders and
J37 0860  1    also as a source of policy guidance. In the absence
J37 0860 11    of a reservoir of political consensus each organized
J37 0870  6    political group hopes that the elections will give
J37 0880  3    them new prominence, but in a system where there is
J37 0890  1    as yet no place for the less prominent. Lacking the
J37 0890 11    respected and effective institutions that consensus
J37 0900  4    helps provide, minority parties, such as the P.D.I.
J37 0910  4    in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958,
J37 0920  3    clamor for elections when out of power, but are not
J37 0920 13    at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular
J37 0930  9    choice when in power. Those in power tend to procrastinate
J37 0940  6    and even to repudiate the electoral process. The tendency
J37 0950  4    to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest
J37 0960  1    rather than an instrument of national interest had
J37 0960  9    two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco.
J37 0970  6       At the central level the scrutin uninominal voting
J37 0980  5    system was selected over some form of the scrutin de
J37 0990  5    liste system, even though the latter had been recommended
J37 1000  2    by Duverger and favored by all political parties. The
J37 1010  1    choice of the single member district was dictated to
J37 1010 10    a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding
J37 1020  7    in the more remote areas of the country, but it also
J37 1030  7    served to minimize the national political value of
J37 1040  3    the elections. Although the elections were for local
J37 1040 11    officials, it was not necessary to conduct the elections
J37 1050  9    so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying
J37 1060  4    their candidates. With multiple member districts the
J37 1070  3    still fragmentary local party organizations could have
J37 1080  1    operated more effectively and parties might have been
J37 1080  9    encouraged to state their positions more clearly. Both
J37 1090  7    parties and the Ministry of the Interior were busily
J37 1100  5    at work after the elections trying to unearth the political
J37 1110  3    affiliations of the successful candidates and, thereby,
J37 1120  1    give the elections a confidential but known degree
J37 1120  9    of national political significance. Since a national
J37 1130  5    interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate
J37 1140  4    that the elections were not held in a way to maximize
J37 1150  1    party responsibility and the educational effect of
J37 1150  8    mass political participation.
J37 1160  1       The general setting of the Moroccan election may
J37 1170  1    also encourage the deterioration of local party organization.
J37 1170  9    The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads
J37 1180  7    not only to party bickering, but to distraction from
J37 1190  5    local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits
J37 1200  3    in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections.
J37 1210  1    Interesting evidence can be found in the results of
J37 1210 10    the Chamber of Commerce elections, which took place
J37 1220  7    three weeks before national elections. The Istiqlal
J37 1230  4    sponsored U.M.C.I.A. (L'Union Marocaine des Commercants,
J37 1240  4    Industrialistes et Artisans) was opposed by candidates
J37 1250  5    of the new U.N.F.P. (L'Union National des Forces Populaires)
J37 1260  5    in nearly all urban centers. As the more conservative
J37 1270  5    group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen,
J37 1280  2    the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more
J37 1290  4    progressive, labor-based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned
J37 1300  4    heavily, while the older, more confident party expected
J37 1310  2    the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support
J37 1310 10    them as they had done for many years. The local Istiqlal
J37 1320 11    and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily.
J37 1330  8    The value of the elections was lost, both as an experiment
J37 1340 11    in increased political participation and as a reliable
J37 1350  6    indicator of commercial interest, as shown in Table
J37 1360  5    I.
J37 1360  6       The chamber of Commerce elections were, of course,
J37 1370  4    an important event in the preparation for rural commune
J37 1380  1    elections. The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization,
J37 1390  1    which depends heavily on U.M.T. support, was most effective.
J37 1400  2    The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity
J37 1400  9    of the independence struggle was not easily transposed
J37 1410  8    to the more concrete, precise problems of internal
J37 1420  5    politics. The overall effect was probably to stimulate
J37 1430  3    more party activity in the communal elections than
J37 1440  1    might have otherwise taken place.
J37 1440  6       A second major point of this essay is to examine
J37 1450  5    the formal arrangements for the elections. Although
J37 1460  1    a somewhat technical subject, it has important political
J37 1460  9    implications as the above discussion of the voting
J37 1470  8    system indicated. Furthermore, the problems and solutions
J37 1480  5    devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly
J37 1490  3    changing countries are often of comparative value and
J37 1490 11    essential to evaluating election results. The sine
J37 1500  7    qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial
J37 1510  5    and standardized procedure. As the background discussion
J37 1520  3    indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that
J37 1530  2    a government dominated by either party could fairly
J37 1530 10    administer elections. The P.D.I. and later the Popular
J37 1540  8    Movement protected the Istiqlal's "privileged position"
J37 1550  5    until the fall of Balafrej, and then the Istiqlal used
J37 1560  7    the same argument, which it had previously ignored,
J37 1570  3    against the pro-U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim
J37 1580  4    government.
J37 1580  5       The bulk of the preparation had, of course, proceeded
J37 1590  4    under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior,
J37 1600  1    whose officials are barred from party activity and
J37 1600  9    probably generally disinterested in party politics.
J37 1610  5    Apart from some areas of recurring trouble, like Bani
J37 1620  4    Mellal, where inexperienced officials had been appointed,
J37 1630  3    there is little evidence that local officials intervened
J37 1640  1    in the electoral process. Centrally, however, the administrative
J37 1650  1    problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of
J37 1650 10    office was very likely an unfair advantage. The King
J37 1660  6    decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and
J37 1670  4    to institute a non-party Council of Government under
J37 1680  2    his personal direction. Although the monarch had frequently
J37 1680 10    asserted that the elections were to be without party
J37 1690  9    significance, his action was an implicit admission
J37 1700  5    that party identifications were a factor. The new Council
J37 1710  4    was itself inescapably of political meaning, which
J37 1720  1    was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P.
J37 1730  1    members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders.
J37 1730  9    Since the details of the elections were settled the
J37 1740  8    change of government had no direct effect on the technical
J37 1750  6    aspects of the elections, and may have been more important
J37 1760  3    as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P.
J37 1770  1       Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959, although
J37 1780  2    the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes
J37 1790  1    was completed in 1958. There were three major administrative
J37 1790 10    tasks: the fixing of electoral districts, the registration
J37 1800  8    of voters and the registration of candidates. Voter
J37 1810  5    registration began in late November 1959 and continued
J37 1820  4    until early January, 1960. The government was most
J37 1830  2    anxious that there be a respectable response. Periodic
J37 1830 10    bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made
J37 1840  8    the registration process into a kind of competition
J37 1850  6    among provincial officials. A goal was fixed, as given
J37 1860  3    in Table 2, and attention focused on its fulfillment.
J37 1860 12    The qualifications to vote were kept very simple. Both
J37 1870  9    men and women of twenty-one years of age could register
J37 1880  8    and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification.
J37 1890  5    There were liberal provisions for dispensation where
J37 1900  3    documents or records were lacking. The police were
J37 1910  1    disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized
J37 1910  8    citizens, criminals and those punished for Protectorate
J37 1920  6    activities.
J37 1920  7       The registration figures given in Table 2 must be
J37 1930  9    interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible
J37 1940  6    electors were made without the benefit of a reliable
J37 1950  4    census.
