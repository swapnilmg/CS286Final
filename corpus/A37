A37 0010  3    _THE THREE-FRONT WAR_
A37 0010  7       At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week,
A37 0020  6    Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final
A37 0030  3    report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
A37 0040  1    U.S. affairs abroad. Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic
A37 0040  7    Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen. What
A37 0050  9    Herter presented, said Gore, was "not a very encouraging
A37 0060  8    review". That was something of an understatement in
A37 0070  5    a week when the underlying conflict between the West
A37 0080  3    and Communism erupted on three fronts. While Communists
A37 0090  1    were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the
A37 0090  9    Congo from chaos, two other Communist offensives stirred
A37 0100  6    the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences
A37 0110  4    and serious decisions.
A37 0120  1    _1) CUBA._
A37 0120  1       Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and
A37 0120 11    artillery, Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted
A37 0130  5    the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand: within 48
A37 0140  5    hours, the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate
A37 0150  4    staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons (the embassy
A37 0160  2    staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens, plus 120 Cuban
A37 0170  1    employees). President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m.
A37 0170  8    meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers,
A37 0180  7    decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately.
A37 0190  3    "There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect
A37 0200  5    can endure", said the President. "That limit has now
A37 0210  3    been reached".
A37 0210  5       Through Secretary Herter, Ike offered President-elect
A37 0220  4    Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration
A37 0230  2    with the breakoff decision. Kennedy, through Secretary-designate
A37 0240  1    of State Dean Rusk, declined. He thus kept his hands
A37 0250  1    free for any action after Jan. 20, although reaction
A37 0250 10    to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and
A37 0260  8    Latin America (see THE HEMISPHERE).
A37 0270  3    _2) LAOS._
A37 0270  5       After a White House huddle between the President
A37 0280  4    and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted
A37 0290  1    sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of
A37 0290 11    Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had
A37 0300  7    invaded Laos from North Viet Nam. "In view of the present
A37 0310  8    situation in Laos", said the Pentagon's announcement,
A37 0320  3    "we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase
A37 0330  3    the readiness of our forces in the Pacific". Cutting
A37 0340  1    short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers
A37 0340 10    Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South
A37 0350  8    China Sea, accompanied by a swarm of destroyers, plus
A37 0360  7    troopships loaded with marines. On the U.S.'s island
A37 0370  5    base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made up of Army, Navy,
A37 0380  5    Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move southward
A37 0390  2    on signal.
A37 0390  4       But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was
A37 0400  3    read as an exaggeration (see FOREIGN NEWS), and the
A37 0410  2    U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French
A37 0410 11    allies that a neutralist- rather than a pro-Western-
A37 0420  9    government might be best for Laos.
A37 0430  5    _FRENCH + INDIANS._
A37 0430  8       There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation
A37 0440  6    that said much about all other cold-war fronts. Political,
A37 0450  3    economic and military experts were all agreed that
A37 0460  1    chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place
A37 0460  9    in the world to fight a war- and they were probably
A37 0470  9    right. "It would be like fighting the French and Indian
A37 0480  5    War all over again", said one military man. But why
A37 0490  4    was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?
A37 0500  1       At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China
A37 0500 12    settled, the British and French gave in to Russian
A37 0510  8    and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting
A37 0520  6    up of a Communist state, North Viet Nam- which then,
A37 0530  3    predictably, became a base for Communist operations
A37 0540  1    against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos. The late
A37 0540 10    Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the
A37 0550  8    1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement, saw
A37 0560  6    that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming
A37 0570  5    a calamity for the West. He began the diplomatic discussions
A37 0580  2    that resulted in the establishment of SEATO. "The
A37 0590  2    important thing from now on", he said, "is not to mourn
A37 0590 13    the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent
A37 0600 10    the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension
A37 0610  8    of Communism throughout Southeast Asia".
A37 0620  3       Russian tanks and artillery parading through the
A37 0630  2    streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and
A37 0630 11    Russian arms drops in Laos (using the same Ilyushin
A37 0640  9    transports that were used to carry Communist agents
A37 0650  6    to the Congo) made it plain once more that the cold
A37 0660  4    war was all of a piece in space and time. Soviet Premier
A37 0670  1    Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect
A37 0680  1    Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. Considering
A37 0680 10    the state of the whole world, the cold war's three
A37 0690 10    exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous; but,
A37 0700  6    in Senator Gore's words, it was "not a very encouraging"
A37 0710  5    situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration
A37 0720  4    Day.
A37 0720  5    #THE CONGRESS#
A37 0730  1    _TURMOIL IN THE HOUSE_
A37 0730  2       As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week,
A37 0730 11    liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to
A37 0740  9    open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules
A37 0750  5    Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation
A37 0760  2    to the floor. The liberal pressure bloc (which coyly
A37 0770  1    masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group)
A37 0770  8    had fought the committee before, and had always lost.
A37 0780  7    This time, they were much better prepared and organized,
A37 0790  4    and the political climate was favorable. They had the
A37 0800  4    unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose
A37 0800 11    own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee
A37 0810  9    bottleneck. And counting noses, they seemed to have
A37 0820  8    the votes to work their will.
A37 0830  1    _DEADLY DEADLOCK._
A37 0830  3       There were two possible methods of breaching the
A37 0840  2    conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1)
A37 0840  9    to pack it with additional liberals and break the
A37 0850  8    conservative-liberal
A37 0850 10    deadlock, or 2) to remove one of the conservatives-
A37 0860  9    namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer
A37 0870  6    (pronounced Calmer). Caucusing, the liberals decided
A37 0880  3    to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic
A37 0890  1    course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
A37 0900  1       A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer
A37 0900 10    looks younger than his 70 years, has gradually swung
A37 0910  7    from a moderate, internationalist position to that
A37 0920  3    of a diehard conservative. He is generally and initially
A37 0930  1    suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens
A37 0930  9    to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents. He is, of course,
A37 0940  8    a segregationist, but he says he has never made an
A37 0950  8    "anti-Negro" speech. For 20 years he has enjoyed his
A37 0960  4    power on the Rules Committee. There his vote, along
A37 0970  1    with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia
A37 0970 10    judge, and the four Republican members, could and often
A37 0980  9    did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out,
A37 0990  1    Democratic-sponsored
A37 0990  3    welfare legislation (a tactic often acceptable to the
A37 1000  7    Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing
A37 1010  4    votes).
A37 1010  5    _EQUAL TREATMENT._
A37 1010  7       There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's
A37 1020  6    ouster: he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy
A37 1030  7    electors in Mississippi. Reprisals are not unheard
A37 1040  4    of in such situations, but the recent tendency has
A37 1050  1    been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons.
A37 1050 10    In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their
A37 1060  5    1948 rebellion against Harry Truman, and in 1957, after
A37 1070  2    Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight
A37 1080  3    Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch
A37 1090  1    his committee assignments, although they did strip
A37 1090  8    him temporarily of his patronage. (In the heat of the
A37 1100  9    anti-Colmer drive last week, Judge Smith threatened
A37 1110  3    reprisal against Powell. Said he: "We will see whether
A37 1120  3    whites and Negroes are treated the same around here".)
A37 1130  1    But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach
A37 1130 10    with President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year
A37 1140  8    something had to be done about the Rules Committee-
A37 1150  6    and that he was the only man who could do anything
A37 1160  3    effective.
A37 1160  4       In a tense, closed-door session with Judge Smith,
A37 1170  3    Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add
A37 1180  1    three new members to the Rules Committee (two Democrats,
A37 1180 10    including one Southerner, and one Republican). Smith
A37 1190  7    flatly rejected the offer, and Mister Sam thereupon
A37 1200  5    decided to join the rebels. The next morning he summoned
A37 1210  4    a group of top Democrats to his private office and
A37 1220  1    broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer,
A37 1220 12    whom he is said to regard as "an inferior man".
A37 1230  9       News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out. When
A37 1240  6    Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word, he turned
A37 1250  5    purple. "Unconscionable"! he shouted, and rushed off
A37 1260  3    to the Speaker's Room to object: "A dangerous precedent"!
A37 1270  1    Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome
A37 1270  8    support to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of
A37 1280  9    the Appropriations Committee, he holds over each member
A37 1290  7    the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional
A37 1300  5    district from federal pork-barrel projects. Sitting
A37 1310  2    quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge
A37 1320  1    Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the
A37 1320  9    Armed Services Committee.
A37 1330  2    _THREAT OF WAR._
A37 1330  5       As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses,
A37 1340  3    it became clear that Judge Smith could lose. His highest
A37 1350  2    count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly
A37 1350 11    twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic
A37 1360  9    caucus. The liberals, smelling blood, were faced with
A37 1370  6    the necessity of winning three big votes- in the Democratic
A37 1380  6    Committee on Committees, in the full party caucus,
A37 1390  3    and on the floor of the House- before they could oust
A37 1400  1    Colmer. (One big question: If Colmer was to be purged,
A37 1400 11    what should the House do about the other three senior
A37 1410  9    Mississippians who supported the maverick electors?)
A37 1420  4    In all three arenas, they seemed certain of victory-
A37 1430  3    especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.
A37 1440  1       But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed
A37 1440 10    the specter of losing a costlier war. If the Southerners
A37 1450  9    were sufficiently aroused, they could very well cut
A37 1460  6    the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their
A37 1470  3    vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam
A37 1480  1    Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party. With
A37 1480  8    that possibility in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately
A37 1490  7    delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees,
A37 1500  7    and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and
A37 1510  5    Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving
A37 1520  4    compromise. "Here are two old men, mad at each other
A37 1530  1    and too proud to pick up the phone", said a House Democratic
A37 1530 13    leader. "One wants a little more power, and the other
A37 1540 10    doesn't want to give up any".
A37 1550  5    _BATTLE IN THE SENATE_
A37 1550  9       The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own
A37 1560  6    version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle,
A37 1570  2    but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed
A37 1580  1    as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech. Question
A37 1580 10    at issue: How big a vote should be necessary to restrict
A37 1590 10    Senate debate- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying
A37 1600  6    filibusters?
A37 1600  7       A wide-ranging, bipartisan force- from Minnesota's
A37 1610  5    Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican
A37 1620  4    Leverett Saltonstall- was drawn up against a solid
A37 1630  6    phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally
A37 1640  1    used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills. New
A37 1640 10    Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change
A37 1650  8    the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths
A37 1660  8    of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate,
A37 1670  6    instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds. Fair
A37 1680  2    Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power
A37 1680 10    for a mere majority of Senators. Georgia's Dick Russell
A37 1690  8    objected politely, and the battle was joined.
A37 1700  6       Privately, the liberals admitted that the Humphrey
A37 1710  4    amendment had no chance of passage. Privately, they
A37 1720  2    also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's
A37 1720 10    three-fifths modification depended on none other than
A37 1730  7    Republican Richard Nixon. In 1957 Nixon delivered a
A37 1740  6    significant opinion that a majority of Senators had
A37 1750  3    the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each
A37 1760  1    new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous
A37 1760 11    Congresses were not binding.
A37 1770  3       Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals
A37 1780  1    rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke
A37 1780 10    off debate on the filibuster battle this week. Hopefully,
A37 1790  8    the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought
A37 1800  8    to a settlement once and for all.
A37 1810  1    #REPUBLICANS#
A37 1810  1    _LAST ACT_
A37 1810  3       Since Election Day, Vice President Richard Nixon
A37 1820  3    had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public
A37 1830  1    view. But with the convening of the new Congress, he
A37 1830 11    was the public man again, presiding over the Senate
A37 1840  7    until John Kennedy's Inauguration. One day last week,
A37 1850  5    Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required
A37 1860  3    him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to
A37 1870  1    hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote,
A37 1870 10    and then to make "sufficient declaration" of the election
A37 1880  7    of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential
A37 1890  7    election. Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace,
A37 1900  4    then went beyond the required "sufficient declaration".
A37 1910  1       "This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate
A37 1920  1    for the presidency announced the result of an election
A37 1920 10    in which he was defeated", he said.
