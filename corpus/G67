G67 0010  1    He looked at her as she spoke, then got up as she was
G67 0010 14    speaking still, and, simply and wordlessly, walked
G67 0020  6    out. And that was the end. Or nearly.
G67 0030  1       He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken.
G67 0040  1    Would he meet him in Baltimore in Drawing Room A,
G67 0040 11    Car Three on the train leaving Washington at nine o'clock
G67 0050  9    next morning? They would go to New York together, where
G67 0060  9    parties would be piled on weariness and on misery.
G67 0070  5    But not for long. Both Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace
G67 0080  3    had written him enthusiastic praise of Elmer Gantry
G67 0090  1    (any changes could be made in proof, which was already
G67 0090 11    coming from the printer) and they had ordered 140,000
G67 0100  8    copies- the largest first printing of any book in history.
G67 0110  7    But none of this could soothe the exacerbated nerves.
G67 0120  3    On New Year's Eve, Alfred Harcourt drove him up the
G67 0130  4    Hudson to Bill Brown's Training Camp, a well-known
G67 0130 13    establishment for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation
G67 0140  7    of drunkards who could no longer help themselves. But,
G67 0150  7    in departing, Lewis begged Breasted that there be no
G67 0160  6    liquor in the apartment at the Grosvenor on his return,
G67 0170  3    and he took with him the first thirty galleys of Elmer
G67 0180  1    Gantry.
G67 0180  2       On January 4, with the boys back at school and college,
G67 0190  1    Mrs. Lewis wrote Harcourt to say that she was "thro,
G67 0190 11    quite thro". "This whole Washington venture was my
G67 0200  8    last gesture, and it has failed. Physically as well
G67 0210  8    as mentally I have reached the limit of my endurance.
G67 0220  5    My last gift to him is complete silence until the book
G67 0230  3    is out and the first heated discussion dies down. For
G67 0230 13    him to divorce God and wife simultaneously would be
G67 0240  8    bad publicity. I am really ill at the present moment,
G67 0250  7    and I will go to some sort of a sanitarium to normalize
G67 0260  3    myself". And she withdrew then to Cromwell Hall, in
G67 0270  3    Cromwell, Connecticut.
G67 0270  5       Harcourt replied: "I do really hope you can achieve
G67 0280  6    serenity in the course of time. Of course I hope Hal
G67 0290  4    can also, but those hopes are much more faint".
G67 0300  1    #8#
G67 0300  1    ON JANUARY 8, 1927, he returned to the Grosvenor in
G67 0300 11    high spirits, and looking fit. He had been, he wrote
G67 0310 10    Mencken at once, "in the country", a euphemism for
G67 0320  6    an experience that had not greatly changed him. Charles
G67 0330  4    Breasted remembers that, before unpacking his bag,
G67 0340  1    he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order,
G67 0340  9    and almost at once "the familiar procession of people
G67 0350  7    began milling through our living room at any hour between
G67 0360  6    two P.M. and three A.M.". They were strays of every
G67 0370  6    kind- university students and journalists, Village
G67 0380  2    hangers-on and barflies, taxi drivers and editors and
G67 0380 11    unknown poets, as well as friends like Elinor Wylie
G67 0390  9    and William Rose Benet, the Van Dorens and Nathan,
G67 0400  6    Rebecca West and Hugh Walpole and Osbert Sitwell, Laurence
G67 0410  5    Stallings, Lewis Browne, William Seabrook, Arthur Hopkins,
G67 0420  3    the Woodwards. When he came home from his office at
G67 0430  3    the end of the afternoon, Breasted never knew what
G67 0430 12    gathering he should expect to find, but there almost
G67 0440  9    always was one.
G67 0450  1       He did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall, but
G67 0450 11    telephoned her and wrote her with assurances of his
G67 0460  7    continuing interest and of his wish to "stand behind"
G67 0470  4    her in their separation and of his hope that there
G67 0480  1    would be no bitterness between them. She was occupying
G67 0480 10    herself in an attempt to write an article about the
G67 0490  9    variety of houses that they had rented abroad. He was
G67 0500  6    of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad
G67 0510  2    when the Gantry galleys were finished. For a time,
G67 0510 11    urging Breasted to give up his public relations work
G67 0520  9    and take up writing instead, he hoped to persuade him
G67 0530  7    to become his assistant in research for the labor novel;
G67 0540  5    if Breasted agreed, they would get a car and tour the
G67 0550  2    country, visiting every kind of industrial center.
G67 0550  9    When Breasted insisted that this was impossible for
G67 0560  7    him, Lewis decided to go abroad.
G67 0570  1       He telephoned L. M. Birkhead and asked him and his
G67 0580  1    wife to come to Europe as his guests, but Birkhead
G67 0580 11    declined on the grounds that one of them must be in
G67 0590  9    the United States when Elmer Gantry was published.
G67 0600  4    Lewis was spending his mornings, with the help of two
G67 0610  4    secretaries, on the galleys of that long novel, making
G67 0610 13    considerable revisions, and the combination of hard
G67 0620  7    work and hard frivolity exhausted him once more, so
G67 0630  6    that he was compelled to spend three days in the Harbor
G67 0640  4    Sanatorium in the last week of January. Before he made
G67 0650  2    that retreat, he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas
G67 0650 10    City and asked him to come to Europe with him. Blackman
G67 0660 10    was to be in New York by February 2, because they were
G67 0670  7    sailing at 12:01 next morning. Lewis told him what
G67 0680  5    clothes he should bring along, and enjoined him not
G67 0690  2    to buy anything that he did not already own, they would
G67 0690 13    do that in New York. Blackman arrived a day or two
G67 0700 10    early, and Lewis took him to a department store immediately
G67 0710  6    and outfitted him, luggage and all, and then he took
G67 0720  5    him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until
G67 0730  1    four in the morning.
G67 0730  5       On the evening that they were to sail, Lewis himself
G67 0740  3    gave a party, but he was too indisposed to appear at
G67 0740 14    it. Woodward took occasion to warn Blackman about Lewis's
G67 0750  9    drinking and urged him to "try to keep him sober".
G67 0760 10    After a dinner party for which she had come down to
G67 0770  7    New York, Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them
G67 0780  5    off, and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated
G67 0790  2    that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised
G67 0790 12    to be about the real nature of their separation. Nevertheless,
G67 0800 10    Mrs. Lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let
G67 0810  9    him do as he wished, let him sleep with chambermaids
G67 0820  6    if he must, but, she begged Blackman, try to keep him
G67 0830  5    from drinking a great deal and bring him back in good
G67 0840  2    health. As they stood at the first-class rail, waving
G67 0840 12    down to his wife and Casanova below, Lewis said, "Earl,
G67 0850  8    there is Gracie's future husband". And when questioned
G67 0860  6    by ship's reporters about the separation, she said,
G67 0870  5    "I adore him, and he adores me".
G67 0880  1       Blackman had brought news from Kansas City. Before
G67 0880  8    his departure, a group of his friends, the Reverend
G67 0890  8    Stidger among them, had given him a luncheon, and Stidger
G67 0900  6    had seen advance sheets of Elmer Gantry. He was outraged
G67 0910  4    by the book and announced that he had discovered fifty
G67 0920  2    technical errors in its account of church practices.
G67 0920 10    L. M. Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was
G67 0930 10    silent. But his rancor did not cease, and presently,
G67 0940  6    on March 13, when he preached a sermon on the text,
G67 0950  4    "And Ben-hadad Was Drunk", he told his congregation
G67 0960  1    how disappointed he was in Mr. Lewis, how he regretted
G67 0960 11    having had him in his house, and how he should have
G67 0970 11    been warned by the fact that the novelist was drunk
G67 0980  6    all the time that he was working on the book. But that
G67 0990  4    sermon, like those of hundreds of other ministers,
G67 0990 12    was yet to be delivered.
G67 1000  5       In London Lewis took the usual suite in Bury Street.
G67 1010  4    To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life,
G67 1020  1    about his wish to be a newspaperman once more, about
G67 1020 11    the prevalence of American slang in British speech,
G67 1030  6    about the loquacity of the English and the impossibility
G67 1040  4    of finding quiet in a railway carriage, about his plans
G67 1050  3    to wander for two years "unless stopped and made to
G67 1050 13    write another book". The Manchester Guardian wondered
G67 1060  7    how anyone in a railway carriage would have an opportunity
G67 1070  9    to talk to Mr. Lewis, since it was well known that
G67 1080  7    Mr. Lewis always did all of the talking. His English
G67 1090  3    friends, it said, had gone into training to keep up
G67 1100  2    with him vocally and with his "allegro movements around
G67 1100 11    the luncheon table". The New York Times editorialist
G67 1110  7    wondered just who would stop Mr. Lewis and make him
G67 1120  8    write a book.
G67 1120 11       Lewis's remarks about his marriage were suggestive
G67 1130  7    enough to induce American reporters to invade the offices
G67 1140  6    of Harcourt, Brace + Company for information, to pursue
G67 1150  4    Mrs. Lewis to Cromwell Hall, and, after she had returned
G67 1160  4    to New York, to ferret her out at the Stanhope on upper
G67 1170  2    Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment. There,
G67 1170 11    to the Evening Post, she emphatically denied the divorce
G67 1180  8    rumors and explained that she had stayed behind because
G67 1190  7    of the schooling of their son, which henceforth would
G67 1200  4    be strictly American. These rumors of permanent separation
G67 1210  2    started up a whole crop of stories about her. One had
G67 1220  1    it that a friend, protesting her snobbery, said, "But,
G67 1220 10    Gracie, you are an American, aren't you"? and she replied,
G67 1230 10    "I was born in America, but I was conceived in Vienna".
G67 1240  9    Lewis himself furthered these tales. He is said to
G67 1250  9    have reported that once, when she went to a hospital
G67 1260  7    to call on a friend after a serious operation, and
G67 1270  2    the friend protested that it had been "nothing", she
G67 1270 11    replied, "Well, it was your healthy American peasant
G67 1280  8    blood that pulled you through". With these and similar
G67 1290  7    tales he was entertaining his English friends, all
G67 1300  4    of whom he was seeing when he was not showing Blackman
G67 1310  2    the sights of London and its environs.
G67 1310  9       At once upon his arrival, he telephoned Lady Sybil
G67 1320  7    Colefax who invited them to tea, and then Lewis decided
G67 1330  6    to give a party as a quick way of rounding up his friends.
G67 1340  4    He invited Lady Sybil, Lord Thomson, Bechhofer Roberts,
G67 1350  2    and a half dozen others. It was a dinner party, Lewis
G67 1350 13    had been drinking during the afternoon, and long before
G67 1360  9    the party really got under way, he was quite drunk,
G67 1370  8    with the result that the party broke up even before
G67 1380  4    dinner was over. Lewis, at the head of the table, would
G67 1390  1    leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests
G67 1390 12    making remarks that, when not highly offensive, were
G67 1400  7    at least highly inappropriate, and then presently he
G67 1410  5    collapsed and was put to bed.
G67 1410 11       When Blackman emerged from the bedroom, everyone
G67 1420  7    was gone except the tolerant Lord Thomson, who stayed
G67 1430  5    and chatted with him for half an hour, and then Blackman
G67 1440  4    lay awake most of that night, despairing of what he
G67 1450  1    must expect on the Continent. Finally, at dawn, he
G67 1450 10    fell asleep, and when he awoke and came into the living
G67 1460  9    room, he found Lewis in his pajamas before the fire,
G67 1470  4    smoking a cigarette. Blackman said that he wanted to
G67 1480  2    apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making
G67 1480 10    that horrible spectacle of himself, that he should
G67 1490  7    have seized him by the neck at once and forcibly hauled
G67 1500  6    him into his bedroom. Lewis warned him never to lay
G67 1510  3    a hand on him, and then Blackman asked for his fare
G67 1510 14    back to the United States. Lewis looked at him and
G67 1520 10    began to cry, and then, saying that he was going to
G67 1530  7    make a promise, he asked Blackman to call the porter
G67 1540  3    and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he
G67 1540 15    did not want. "And from now on, for the rest of this
G67 1550 12    trip, I will only drink what you agree that I should
G67 1560  8    drink". Blackman called the porter and had him remove
G67 1570  5    everything but one bottle of brandy, and after that
G67 1580  2    they would have a cocktail or two before dinner, or,
G67 1580 12    on one of their walking trips, beer, or, in France
G67 1590  7    and Italy, wine in moderation.
G67 1600  1       Lewis gave him a guidebook tour of London and, motoring
G67 1600 11    and walking, took him to Stratford, but the London
G67 1610  9    stay was for only ten days, and on the twentieth they
G67 1620  7    took the train for Southampton, where they spent the
G67 1630  4    night for an early morning Channel crossing. Near Southampton,
G67 1640  2    in a considerable establishment, lived Homer Vachell,
G67 1650  1    a well-known pulp writer, and his brother, Horace-
G67 1650 10    both friends of Lewis's. He suggested that they call
G67 1660  7    on these brothers, who received them pleasantly. Then
G67 1670  4    they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed.
G67 1680  3    It was late, and Blackman was ready to go to sleep,
G67 1680 14    but Lewis was not. He said, "We had a good time tonight,
G67 1690 11    didn't we, Earl"? Earl agreed, and Lewis said that
G67 1700  7    it would have been very different if his wife had been
G67 1710  6    with him. Then he kept Blackman awake for more than
G67 1720  4    an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between
G67 1720 13    his wife and himself in which, discussing the evening,
G67 1730  8    he was continually berated. He began the dialogue by
G67 1740  6    having his wife announce that one does not invade people's
G67 1750  4    homes without warning them that one is coming, and
G67 1760  2    went on from that with the entire catalogue of his
G67 1760 12    social gaucheries.
