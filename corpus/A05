A05 0010  1       East Providence should organize its civil defense
A05 0010  8    setup and begin by appointing a full-time director,
A05 0020  7    Raymond H. Hawksley, the present city CD head, believes.
A05 0030  6       Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing
A05 0040  5    to go before the city council "or anyone else locally"
A05 0050  3    to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
A05 0060  1       East Providence now has no civil defense program.
A05 0060  9    Mr. Hawksley, the state's general treasurer, has been
A05 0070  7    a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine
A05 0080  9    years. He is not interested in being named a full-time
A05 0090  6    director.
A05 0090  7       Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense
A05 0100  5    Department the major responsibility for the nation's
A05 0110  3    civil defense program, Mr. Hawksley said the federal
A05 0120  1    government would pay half the salary of a full-time
A05 0120 11    local director.
A05 0130  1       He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD
A05 0130 11    director for about $3,500 a year and would only have
A05 0140 10    to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis
A05 0150  5    to defray the salary costs.
A05 0150 10       Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number
A05 0160  8    of qualified city residents who would be willing to
A05 0170  6    take the full-time CD job. One of these men is former
A05 0180  4    Fire Chief John A. Laughlin, he said.
A05 0180 11       Along with a director, the city should provide a
A05 0190  9    CD headquarters so that pertinent information about
A05 0200  5    the local organization would be centralized. Mr. Hawksley
A05 0210  3    said.
A05 0210  4       One advantage that would come to the city in having
A05 0220  5    a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence
A05 0230  1    would become eligible to apply to the federal government
A05 0230 10    for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for
A05 0240  7    a sound civil defense program.
A05 0250  2       Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement
A05 0250 10    of such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks,
A05 0260  9    he said.
A05 0260 11       Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could
A05 0270  7    use two more rescue trucks, similar to the CD vehicle
A05 0280  7    obtained several years ago and now detailed to the
A05 0290  5    Central Fire Station.
A05 0290  8       He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the
A05 0300  8    Riverside section of the city and the other to the
A05 0310  4    Rumford area.
A05 0310  6       Speaking of the present status of civil defense
A05 0320  3    in the city, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing
A05 0330  1    to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would
A05 0330 13    know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy
A05 0340 12    attack.
A05 0340 13       The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly
A05 0350  7    point, he said, and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would
A05 0360  5    be another. Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk
A05 0370  5    assembly point.
A05 0370  7       Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents
A05 0380  6    for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in
A05 0390  3    case of an air attack.
A05 0390  8       Such vital information, he said, has to be made
A05 0400  6    available to the public frequently and at regular intervals
A05 0410  2    for residents to know.
A05 0410  6       If the city council fails to consider appointment
A05 0420  3    of a full-time CD director, Mr. Hawksley said, then
A05 0430  3    he plans to call a meeting early in September so that
A05 0430 14    a civil defense organization will be developed locally.
A05 0440  8       One of the first things he would do, he said, would
A05 0450 10    be to organize classes in first aid. Other steps would
A05 0460  6    be developed after information drifts down to the local
A05 0470  4    level from the federal government.
A05 0480  1       Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales
A05 0480 10    law with possible revisions in mind.
A05 0490  4       Governor Notte said last night he plans to name
A05 0500  4    a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations
A05 0510  1    for possible changes in time for the next session of
A05 0510 11    the General Assembly.
A05 0520  2       The governor's move into the so-called "blue law"
A05 0530  2    controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary
A05 0530 13    R. Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy
A05 0540 10    was released to the press.
A05 0550  3       Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted
A05 0560  1    by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent
A05 0560 12    to the state house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges
A05 0570  8    the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday
A05 0580  6    sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the
A05 0590  3    next session of the legislature.
A05 0590  8       While the city council suggested that the Legislative
A05 0600  6    Council might perform the review, Mr. Notte said that
A05 0610  5    instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen.
A05 0620  2    J. Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".
A05 0630  1    He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's
A05 0640  1    cooperation, the governor said.
A05 0640  5       "I would expect the proposed committee to hold public
A05 0650  5    hearings", Mr. Notte said, "to obtain the views of
A05 0660  4    the general public and religious, labor and special-interest
A05 0670  1    groups affected by these laws".
A05 0670  6       The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned
A05 0680  8    for some time "with the continuous problem which confronts
A05 0690  4    our local and state law enforcement officers as a result
A05 0700  4    of the laws regulating Sunday sales".
A05 0700 10       The attorney general has advised local police that
A05 0710  8    it is their duty to enforce the blue laws. Should there
A05 0720  6    be evidence they are shirking, he has said, the state
A05 0730  4    police will step into the situation.
A05 0730 10       There has been more activity across the state line
A05 0740  9    in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks
A05 0750  6    toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws. The statutes,
A05 0760  4    similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and
A05 0770  2    dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely
A05 0770 11    limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on
A05 0780 10    the Sabbath.
A05 0780 12       The Central Falls City Council expressed concern
A05 0790  7    especially that more foods be placed on the eligible
A05 0800  7    list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores
A05 0810  4    be allowed to do business on Sunday.
A05 0810 11       The only day they "have a chance to compete with
A05 0820  9    large supermarkets is on Sunday", the council's resolution
A05 0830  5    said. The small shops "must be retained, for they provide
A05 0840  6    essential service to the community", according to the
A05 0850  4    resolution, which added that they "also are the source
A05 0860  1    of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares
A05 0860 10    that Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue"
A05 0870  7    to the local government.
A05 0880  1       The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,
A05 0890  1    factory outlets and department stores not be allowed
A05 0890  9    to do business" on Sunday. They "operate on a volume
A05 0900  8    basis", it was contended, "and are not essential to
A05 0910  6    provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of
A05 0920  4    the community".
A05 0930  1       Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic
A05 0930  8    and Republican- should divorce themselves and form
A05 0940  6    two independent parties, George H. Reama, nationally
A05 0950  5    known labor-management expert, said here yesterday.
A05 0960  3       Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at
A05 0970  2    its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about
A05 0980  1    half of the people in the country want the "welfare"
A05 0980 11    type of government and the other half want a free enterprise
A05 0990  9    system. He suggested that a regrouping of forces might
A05 1000  7    allow the average voter a better pull at the right
A05 1010  4    lever for him on election day.
A05 1010 10       He said he was "confessing that I was a member of
A05 1020  7    the Socialist Party in 1910". That, he added, was when
A05 1030  6    he was "a very young man, a machinist and toolmaker
A05 1040  2    by trade.
A05 1040  4       "That was before I studied law. Some of my fellow
A05 1050  4    workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist
A05 1060  1    Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me
A05 1060 11    off the Socialist track. He steered me to the right
A05 1070  8    track- the free enterprise track".
A05 1080  1       He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the
A05 1080 12    party called for government operation of all utilities
A05 1090  8    and the pooling of all resources. He suggested that
A05 1100  6    without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national
A05 1110  4    victory, most of its original program has come to pass
A05 1120  2    under both major parties.
A05 1120  6       Mr. Reama, who retired as vice president of the
A05 1130  4    American Screw Co. in 1955 said, "Both parties in the
A05 1140  3    last election told us that we need a five per cent
A05 1140 14    growth in the gross national product- but neither told
A05 1150  9    us how to achieve it".
A05 1160  1       He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but
A05 1160 10    manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze"- and
A05 1170  8    raises should only come when the public is conditioned
A05 1180  7    to higher prices, he added.
A05 1190  1       Indicating the way in which he has turned his back
A05 1190 11    on his 1910 philosophy, Mr. Reama said: "A Socialist
A05 1200  6    is a person who believes in dividing everything he
A05 1210  5    does not own". Mr. Reama, far from really being retired,
A05 1220  4    is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
A05 1230  1       A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700
A05 1230 10    Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council
A05 1240  8    last night as what is hoped will be the first step
A05 1250  6    in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
A05 1260  1       William A. Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens
A05 1260  8    Group of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his
A05 1270  8    left hand to his right hand after the council voted
A05 1280  6    to accept them at the suggestion of Council President
A05 1290  2    Raymond Fortin Sr.
A05 1290  5       The law which governs home rule charter petitions
A05 1300  5    states that they must be referred to the chairman of
A05 1310  3    the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures
A05 1320  1    within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that
A05 1320 11    post.
A05 1330  1       Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more
A05 1330  9    than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of
A05 1340  7    a vote on the home rule charter and possible election
A05 1350  4    of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.
A05 1360  2    He explained that by law the council must establish
A05 1360 11    procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after
A05 1370 11    the board of canvassers completes its work.
A05 1380  4       A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli
A05 1390  2    and John P. Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact
A05 1400  1    manner in which the vote is handled. Mr. Martinelli
A05 1400 10    has, in recent weeks, been of the opinion that a special
A05 1410  9    town meeting would be called for the vote, while Mr.
A05 1420  6    Bourcier said that a special election might be called
A05 1430  4    instead.
A05 1430  5       Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several
A05 1440  2    Superior Court justices in the last week and received
A05 1450  1    opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr. Martinelli
A05 1450  9    and the council that he would study the correct method
A05 1460 10    and report back to the council as soon as possible.
A05 1470  7       Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens
A05 1480  4    Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further
A05 1490  3    strategy in the charter movement. He said that the
A05 1490 12    group has no candidates for the charter commission
A05 1500  8    in mind at present, but that it will undoubtedly endorse
A05 1510  6    candidates when the time comes.
A05 1520  1       "After inspiring this, I think we should certainly
A05 1520  9    follow through on it", he declared. "It has become
A05 1530  8    our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group
A05 1540  6    will spearhead the movement".
A05 1550  1       He said he would not be surprised if some of the
A05 1550 11    more than 30 members of the group are interested in
A05 1560  7    running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts
A05 1570  4    on the charter commission.
A05 1570  8       "Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness
A05 1580  7    of the movement", he indicated, "and to tell them what
A05 1590  6    this will mean for the town". He expects that if the
A05 1600  4    present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled
A05 1610  1    during the last week in September.
A05 1610  7       Some opposition to the home rule movement started
A05 1620  4    to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's
A05 1630  2    insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against
A05 1630  8    the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal
A05 1640  9    league charter. Increasing opposition can be expected
A05 1650  6    in coming weeks, it was indicated.
A05 1660  1       Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule
A05 1660 10    charter was cited as a factor which has caused the
A05 1670 10    Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were
A05 1680  5    termed "false pretenses". Several signers affixed their
A05 1690  3    names, it was learned, after being told that no tax
A05 1700  1    increase would be possible without consent of the General
A05 1700 10    Assembly and that a provision could be included in
A05 1710  9    the charter to have the town take over the Johnston
A05 1720  5    Sanitary District sewer system.
A05 1730  1       Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who
A05 1730  9    plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines
A05 1740  8    at the local police station may be taken at Monday's
A05 1750  5    special North Providence Town Council meeting.
A05 1760  1       Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday
A05 1770  1    he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor
A05 1770 11    Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance.
A05 1780  6       At the last session of the General Assembly, the
A05 1790  4    town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a
A05 1800  3    means of making enforcement of minor offenses more
A05 1800 11    effective. Nothing has been done yet to take advantage
A05 1810  9    of the enabling legislation.
A05 1820  1       At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District
A05 1830  1    Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated
A05 1830  8    to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs
A05 1840  7    involved even for the simplest offense.
