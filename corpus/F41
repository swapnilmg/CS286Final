F41 0010  1    A little farther along the road you come to the Church
F41 0010 12    of Santa Sabina, called the "Pearl of the Aventine".
F41 0020  8    Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the
F41 0030  8    Knights of Malta. On the wall of this square there
F41 0040  6    are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments.
F41 0050  1    The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of
F41 0060  1    the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through
F41 0060 11    the keyhole, you will see an artistically landscaped
F41 0070  7    garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in
F41 0080  6    a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.
F41 0090  1       Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa
F41 0090 12    Sabina and turn right on the Via di S. Alessio, a street
F41 0100 11    lined with stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms
F41 0110  7    in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to
F41 0120  7    this attractive residential section. Turn left a block
F41 0130  4    or so before the street ends, and then turn right down
F41 0140  1    the Via di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino. Here
F41 0140 11    you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return
F41 0150 10    to the center of the city.
F41 0160  1    #THE RENAISSANCE CITY#
F41 0170  1    _TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_
F41 0170  1       These two walks take you through the heart of Rome.
F41 0170 11    You will walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed
F41 0180  9    in by massive palazzi. You will visit a few churches
F41 0190  7    that are exceptional yet often by-passed, a magnificent
F41 0200  3    square, the main shopping district, the Spanish Steps,
F41 0210  2    and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied
F41 0210 11    places, both interesting and beautiful, you will become
F41 0220  8    aware of the many different civilizations Rome has
F41 0230  5    lived through, and in particular, get a feel of Renaissance
F41 0240  5    Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal
F41 0250  3    City.
F41 0250  4       Start on the Via d. Teatro di Marcello at the foot
F41 0260  4    of the Capitoline Hill. The majestic circular tiers
F41 0270  2    of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some
F41 0270 12    idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus
F41 0280  9    erected in 13 B.C. Twenty-two thousand spectators
F41 0290  5    used to crowd it in Roman days. Andrea Palladio, an
F41 0300  4    Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled
F41 0310  1    his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.
F41 0310  9       Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by
F41 0320  8    the arches of the theatre. The remains of the Portico
F41 0330  6    of Octavia are now in front of you. Climb the steps
F41 0340  5    from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di Campitelli
F41 0350  2    for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.
F41 0360  1       Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny
F41 0360 11    Piazza Campitelli, then proceed along the Via dei Funari
F41 0370  8    to the Piazza Mattei. Here is one of the loveliest
F41 0380  6    fountains in Rome, the Fontana delle Tartarughe or
F41 0390  3    "Fountain of the Tortoises". It's typical of Rome that
F41 0400  4    in the midst of this rather poor area you should find
F41 0410  1    such an artistic work in the center of a little square.
F41 0410 12    Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of
F41 0420 11    a fountain with its four youths, each holding a tortoise
F41 0430  5    and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin.
F41 0440  4    The figures have been executed so skillfully that one
F41 0450  1    senses a great feeling of life and movement.
F41 0450  9       Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei, one of Rome's oldest
F41 0460  7    palaces, now the headquarters of the Italo-American
F41 0470  5    Association. Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance
F41 0480  5    palace. In the first courtyard there are some fine
F41 0490  3    bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series
F41 0490 13    of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered
F41 0500  8    wall. The Palazzo Caetani, still inhabited by the Caetani
F41 0510  7    family, adjoins the Palazzo Mattei.
F41 0520  2       Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross
F41 0530  1    the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the Piazza
F41 0530 12    B. Cairoli, where you should look in at the Church
F41 0540 10    of San Carlo ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the
F41 0550  9    ceiling. Follow the colorful and busy Via d. Giubbonari
F41 0560  6    for a hundred yards or so. Now turn left at the Via
F41 0570  5    dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini.
F41 0580  1    Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro
F41 0580 14    will bring you to the Palazzo Spada, built in 1540
F41 0590 10    and now occupied by the Council of State. Paintings
F41 0600  7    by Titian, Caravaggio, and Rubens are on display (open
F41 0610  7    9:30-4:00).
F41 0610  9       Before you enter the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's
F41 0620  6    facade. The great architect also designed the fine
F41 0630  5    interior staircase and colonnade which connects the
F41 0640  3    two courts. The large statue on the first floor is
F41 0640 13    believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of
F41 0650 11    which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death (if so, the
F41 0660  8    statue once stood in the senate house). (This is shown
F41 0670  5    in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)
F41 0680  1       By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard
F41 0680 11    Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective.
F41 0690  7    When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade
F41 0700  5    you have the impression that the statue at the end
F41 0710  3    is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only
F41 0710 13    a few feet away. The sense of perspective has been
F41 0720  9    created by designing the length of the columns so that
F41 0730  7    those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter
F41 0740  4    than those in front. The gardens of the palazzo, shaded
F41 0750  2    by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard
F41 0760  1    is magnificently decorated.
F41 0760  4       From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block
F41 0770  3    along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti to
F41 0780  2    the imposing Palazzo Farnese, begun in 1514 and considered
F41 0790  1    by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo
F41 0790 11    was the most distinguished of several noted architects
F41 0800  5    who helped design it. Today it is occupied by the French
F41 0810  6    Embassy. Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes,
F41 0820  3    as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously
F41 0830  1    high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be
F41 0830  9    seen Sundays (11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern
F41 0840  9    tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat.
F41 0850  6       Directly in front of the palace along the Via d.
F41 0860  5    Baullari you will come to the Campo di Fiori, the famous
F41 0870  3    site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance
F41 0880  1    Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful
F41 0880 11    fruit, vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the
F41 0890  8    Via d. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then
F41 0900  6    turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church
F41 0910  5    of Sant' Andrea della Valle. As you approach the church
F41 0920  4    on the Via d. Baullari you are passing within yards
F41 0930  2    of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey, near
F41 0930 12    which is believed to have been the place where Julius
F41 0940 10    Caesar was assassinated. The dome of the church is,
F41 0950  7    outside of St. Peter's, one of the largest in Rome.
F41 0960  7    Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this
F41 0970  3    church was the scene for the first act of Tosca.
F41 0980  1       At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio
F41 0980 10    Emanuele II, walk along the Corso del Rinascimento
F41 0990  7    a couple of hundred yards, then turn left on the Via
F41 1000  7    dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona,
F41 1010  2    one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.
F41 1010 10       Your first impression of this elongated square with
F41 1020  8    its three elegant fountains, its two churches that
F41 1030  5    almost face each other, and its russet-colored buildings,
F41 1040  2    is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly welcome
F41 1050  2    after wandering around the narrow and dark streets
F41 1050 10    that you have followed since starting this walk.
F41 1060  6       The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient
F41 1070  5    stadium, which was probably used for horse and chariot
F41 1080  5    races. For centuries it was the location of historic
F41 1090  1    festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth
F41 1090 10    to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice
F41 1100  9    to flood the piazza in the summer, and the aristocrats
F41 1110  6    would then ride around the inundated square in their
F41 1120  4    carriages.
F41 1120  5       Giovanni Bernini's "Fountain of the Rivers", in
F41 1130  5    the center of the piazza, is built around a Roman obelisk
F41 1140  4    from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes
F41 1150  1    and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner,
F41 1150 11    denoting four great rivers from different continents-
F41 1160  6    the Danube, the Ganges, the Nile, and the Plate. The
F41 1170  6    eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, perhaps
F41 1180  2    either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to
F41 1180 12    obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church
F41 1190 10    of Sant' Agnese in Agone, the work of Bernini's rival,
F41 1200  8    Borromini.
F41 1210  1       In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes
F41 1210  9    where you can sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch
F41 1220  9    the fountains in the square. The scene before you is
F41 1230  5    indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about
F41 1240  1    Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that
F41 1240 11    extra touch.
F41 1250  1       Take the Via di S. Agnese in Agone, next to the
F41 1250 12    church and opposite the center of the square, then
F41 1260  9    turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the
F41 1270  7    beautiful Church of Santa Maria della Pace. Inside
F41 1280  3    you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael
F41 1290  1    and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's
F41 1290  9    cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful
F41 1300  7    creations.
F41 1300  8       Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on
F41 1310 10    the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale; in a moment
F41 1320  6    cross the Corso del Rinascimento. In front of you is
F41 1330  6    the Palazzo Madama, once belonging to the Medici and
F41 1340  3    now the Italian Senate. Walk by the side of the palazzo
F41 1350  2    and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you
F41 1350 11    will come to the Piazza della Rotonda. You are now
F41 1360  9    facing the Pantheon, the largest and best-preserved
F41 1370  6    building still standing from the days of ancient Rome.
F41 1380  5       This circular edifice, constructed by Agrippa in
F41 1390  3    B.C. 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor
F41 1400  1    Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh
F41 1400 11    century. As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian
F41 1410 10    obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis, you will admire
F41 1420  7    the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns.
F41 1430  2       The Pantheon's interior, still in its original form,
F41 1440  2    is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its
F41 1440 10    rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal
F41 1450  9    to the height from the floor to the ceiling. The only
F41 1460  8    means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide
F41 1470  5    aperture in the stupendous dome. Standing before the
F41 1480  3    tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance,
F41 1480 12    when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great
F41 1490  8    Roman temple, you are once again reminded of the varied
F41 1500  7    civilizations so characteristic of Rome.
F41 1510  2       As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street
F41 1510 11    to the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to Sant'
F41 1520 11    Ignazio, one of the most splendid baroque churches
F41 1530  8    in the city. (Along the way there, about one hundred
F41 1540  5    yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant,
F41 1550  1    La Sacrestia, where you can have the best pizza in
F41 1550 11    Rome.) The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses
F41 1560  9    in front of the church seems like a stage set. This
F41 1570  7    is one of the most charming little squares in this
F41 1580  4    part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in
F41 1590  1    front of the church) will bring you to the Stock Exchange
F41 1590 12    in the old Temple of Neptune. A few yards farther,
F41 1600 10    on the Via dei Bergamaschi, is the Piazza Colonna.
F41 1610  7    The great column from which the square takes its name
F41 1620  7    was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
F41 1630  2       You are now at the Corso, though narrow, one of
F41 1640  2    Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here
F41 1640 10    in the Middle Ages.
F41 1650  2       If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and
F41 1650 12    you have the time and inclination, walk to the right
F41 1660  9    along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to
F41 1670  7    visit the fine private collection of paintings- mainly
F41 1680  4    of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the
F41 1690  1    Palazzo Doria (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday,
F41 1690  8    10:00-1:00). Here is your opportunity to see the inside
F41 1700  9    of a palazzo where the family still lives.
F41 1710  5       Otherwise, cross over the Corso and walk a block
F41 1720  4    or so to the left. You will come to Alemagna, a delightful,
F41 1730  2    though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly
F41 1740  1    noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and
F41 1740 10    patisseries. Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants
F41 1750 10    nearby, is just the place to end this first walk through
F41 1760  8    the heart of Rome.
F41 1770  1    _TO THE SPANISH STEPS_
F41 1770  2       The second walk through the heart of Rome should
F41 1770 11    be taken after lunch, so that you will reach the Pincian
F41 1780 10    Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at
F41 1790 10    its best.
