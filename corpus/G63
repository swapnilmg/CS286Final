G63 0010  1    In the imagination of the nineteenth century the Greek
G63 0010 10    tragedians and Shakespeare stand side by side, their
G63 0020  7    affinity transcending all the immense contrarieties
G63 0030  3    of historical circumstance, religious belief, and poetic
G63 0040  2    form.
G63 0040  3       We no longer use the particular terms of Lessing
G63 0050  1    and Victor Hugo. But we abide by their insight. The
G63 0050 11    word "tragedy" encloses for us in a single span both
G63 0060  9    the Greek and the Elizabethan example. The sense of
G63 0070  5    relationship overreaches the historical truth that
G63 0080  3    Shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual
G63 0090  1    works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. It transcends
G63 0090  9    the glaring fact that the Elizabethans mixed tragedy
G63 0100  8    and comedy whereas the Greeks kept the two modes severely
G63 0110  8    distinct. It overcomes our emphatic awareness of the
G63 0120  4    vast difference in the shape and fabric of the two
G63 0130  2    languages and styles of dramatic presentation. The
G63 0130  9    intimations of a related spirit and ordering of human
G63 0140  8    values are stronger than any sense of disparity. Comparable
G63 0150  5    visions of life are at work in Antigone and Romeo and
G63 0160  4    Juliet. We see at once what Victor Hugo means when
G63 0170  3    he calls Macbeth a northern scion of the house of Atreus.
G63 0180  1    Elsinore seems to lie in a range of Mycenae, and the
G63 0180 12    fate of Orestes resounds in that of Hamlet. The hounds
G63 0190  8    of hell search out their quarry in Apollo's sanctuary
G63 0200  5    as they do in the tent of Richard III. Oedipus and
G63 0210  3    Lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness.
G63 0220  1    It it not between Euripides and Shakespeare that the
G63 0220 10    western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense
G63 0230  9    of life. It is after the late seventeenth century.
G63 0240  5    I say the late seventeenth century because Racine (whom
G63 0250  3    Lessing did not really know) stands on the far side
G63 0260  1    of the chasm. The image of man which enters into force
G63 0260 12    with Aeschylus is still vital in Phedre and Athalie.
G63 0270  8       It is the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics
G63 0280  7    which marks the point of no return. Shakespeare is
G63 0290  6    closer to Sophocles than he is to Pope and Voltaire.
G63 0300  3    To say this is to set aside the realness of time. But
G63 0310  1    it is true, nevertheless. The modes of the imagination
G63 0310 10    implicit in Athenian tragedy continued to shape the
G63 0320  7    life of the mind until the age of Descartes and Newton.
G63 0330  5    It is only then that the ancient habits of feeling
G63 0340  3    and the classic orderings of material and psychological
G63 0340 11    experience were abandoned. With the Discours de la
G63 0350  8    methode and the Principia the things undreamt of in
G63 0360  7    Horatio's philosophy seem to pass from the world.
G63 0370  6       In Greek tragedy as in Shakespeare, mortal actions
G63 0380  3    are encompassed by forces which transcend man. The
G63 0380 11    reality of Orestes entails that of the Furies; the
G63 0390  9    Weird Sisters wait for the soul of Macbeth. We cannot
G63 0400  8    conceive of Oedipus without a Sphinx, nor of Hamlet
G63 0410  5    without a Ghost. The shadows cast by the personages
G63 0420  1    of Greek and Shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater
G63 0420 10    darkness. And the entirety of the natural world is
G63 0430  9    party to the action. The thunderclaps over the sacred
G63 0440  6    wood at Colonus and the storms in King Lear are caused
G63 0450  5    by more than weather. In tragedy, lightning is a messenger.
G63 0460  4    But it can no longer be so once Benjamin Franklin (the
G63 0470  2    incarnation of the new rational man) has flown a kite
G63 0470 12    to it. The tragic stage is a platform extending precariously
G63 0480  8    between heaven and hell. Those who walk on it may encounter
G63 0490  9    at any turn ministers of grace or damnation. Oedipus
G63 0500  4    and Lear instruct us how little of the world belongs
G63 0510  4    to man. Mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous
G63 0520  1    watch, and to all sentinels, whether at Elsinore or
G63 0520 10    on the battlements at Mycenae, the coming of dawn has
G63 0530  8    its breath of miracle. It banishes the night wanderers
G63 0540  5    to fire or repose. But at the touch of Hume and Voltaire
G63 0550  4    the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted
G63 0560  1    the mind since Agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance,
G63 0560 10    disappeared altogether or took tawdry refuge among
G63 0570  7    the gaslights of melodrama. Modern roosters have lost
G63 0580  5    the art of crowing restless spirits back to Purgatory.
G63 0590  2       In Athens, in Shakespeare's England, and at Versailles,
G63 0600  2    the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest.
G63 0610  1    The wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic
G63 0610 12    centre. From it, spokes of order and degree led to
G63 0620 10    the outward rim of the common man. Tragedy presumes
G63 0630  5    such a configuration. Its sphere is that of royal courts,
G63 0640  4    dynastic quarrels, and vaulting ambitions. The same
G63 0650  1    metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply
G63 0650  9    to Oedipus and Macbeth because they applied also to
G63 0660  8    Alcibiades and Essex. And the fate of such men has
G63 0670  7    tragic relevance because it is public. Agamemnon, Creon,
G63 0680  2    and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes
G63 0690  1    of the polis. Similarly the sufferings of Hamlet, Othello,
G63 0700  1    or Phedre engage the fortunes of the state. They are
G63 0700 11    enacted at the heart of the body politic. Hence the
G63 0710  8    natural setting of tragedy is the palace gate, the
G63 0720  4    public square, or the court chamber. Greek and Elizabethan
G63 0730  1    life and, to a certain extent, the life of Versailles
G63 0730 11    shared this character of intense "publicity". Princes
G63 0740  7    and factions clashed in the open street and died on
G63 0750  8    the open scaffold.
G63 0750 11       With the rise to power of the middle class the centre
G63 0760 10    of gravity in human affairs shifted from the public
G63 0770  5    to the private. The art of Defoe and Richardson is
G63 0780  2    founded on an awareness of this great change. Heretofore
G63 0790  1    an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only
G63 0790 10    if it involved high personages and if it occurred in
G63 0800  7    the public view. Behind the tragic hero stands the
G63 0810  4    chorus, the crowd, or the observant courtier. In the
G63 0820  1    eighteenth century there emerges for the first time
G63 0820  9    the notion of a private tragedy (or nearly for the
G63 0830  7    first time, there having been a small number of Elizabethan
G63 0840  4    domestic tragedies such as the famous Arden of Feversham).
G63 0850  3    In La Nouvelle-Heloi^se and Werther tragedy is made
G63 0860  4    intimate. And private tragedy became the chosen ground
G63 0870  1    not of drama, but of the new, unfolding art of the
G63 0870 12    novel.
G63 0880  1       The novel was not only the presenter of the new,
G63 0880 11    secular, rationalistic, private world of the middle
G63 0890  6    class. It served also as a literary form exactly appropriate
G63 0900  3    to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture.
G63 0910  1    I have said before how difficult it is to make any
G63 0910 12    precise statements with regard to the character of
G63 0920  7    the Greek and Elizabethan public. But one major fact
G63 0930  5    seems undeniable. Until the advent of rational empiricism
G63 0940  2    the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic
G63 0950  1    and allegoric. Available evidence regarding the natural
G63 0950  8    world, the course of history, and the varieties of
G63 0960  8    human action were translated into imaginative designs
G63 0970  4    or mythologies. Classic mythology and Christianity
G63 0980  1    are such architectures of the imagination. They order
G63 0980  9    the manifold levels of reality and moral value along
G63 0990  8    an axis of being which extends from brute matter to
G63 1000  6    the immaculate stars. There had not yet supervened
G63 1010  2    between understanding and expression the new languages
G63 1010  9    of mathematics and scientific formulas. The poet was
G63 1020  8    by definition a realist, his imaginings and parables
G63 1030  5    being natural organizations of reality. And in these
G63 1040  4    organizations certain primal notions played a radiant
G63 1050  1    part, radiant both in the sense of giving light and
G63 1050 11    of being a pole toward which all perspectives converge.
G63 1060  6    I mean such concepts as the presence of the supernatural
G63 1070  4    in human affairs, the sacraments of grace and divine
G63 1080  3    retribution, the idea of preordainment (the oracle
G63 1080 10    over Oedipus, the prophecy of the witches to Macbeth,
G63 1090  8    or God's covenant with His people in Athalie). I refer
G63 1100  7    to the notion that the structure of society is a microcosm
G63 1110  6    of the cosmic design and that history conforms to patterns
G63 1120  4    of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality
G63 1130  1    play set in motion by the gods for our instruction.
G63 1130 11       These conceptions and the manner in which they were
G63 1140  9    transposed into poetry or engendered by poetic form
G63 1150  5    are intrinsic to western life from the time of Aeschylus
G63 1160  3    to that of Shakespeare. And although they were, as
G63 1160 12    I have indicated, under increasing strain at the time
G63 1170  9    of Racine, they are still alive in his theatre. They
G63 1180  8    are the essential force behind the conventions of tragedy.
G63 1190  5    They are as decisively present in the Oresteia and
G63 1200  2    Oedipus as in Macbeth, King Lear, and Phedre.
G63 1210  1       After the seventeenth century the audience ceased
G63 1210  8    to be an organic community to which these ideas and
G63 1220 10    their attendant habits of figurative language would
G63 1230  5    be natural or immediately familiar. Concepts such as
G63 1240  3    grace, damnation, purgation, blasphemy, or the chain
G63 1240 10    of being, which are everywhere implicit in classic
G63 1250  8    and Shakespearean tragedy, lose their vitality. They
G63 1260  5    become philosophic abstractions of a private and problematic
G63 1270  5    relevance, or mere catchwords in religious customs
G63 1280  1    which had in them a diminishing part of active belief.
G63 1280 11    After Shakespeare the master spirits of western consciousness
G63 1290  7    are no longer the blind seers, the poets, or Orpheus
G63 1300  8    performing his art in the face of hell. They are Descartes,
G63 1310  6    Newton, and Voltaire. And their chroniclers are not
G63 1320  3    the dramatic poets but the prose novelists.
G63 1320 10       The romantics were the immediate inheritors of this
G63 1330  8    tremendous change. They were not yet prepared to accept
G63 1340  8    it as irremediable. Rousseau's primitivism, the anti-Newtonian
G63 1350  5    mythology of Blake, Coleridge's organic metaphysics,
G63 1360  3    Victor Hugo's image of the poets as the Magi, and Shelley's
G63 1370  3    "unacknowledged legislators" are related elements in
G63 1380  2    the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against
G63 1380 11    the new scientific rationalism. From this action sprang
G63 1390  7    the idea of somehow uniting Greek and Shakespearean
G63 1400  4    drama into a new total form, capable of restoring to
G63 1410  4    life the ancient moral and poetic responses. The dream
G63 1420  1    of achieving a synthesis between the Sophoclean and
G63 1420  9    the Shakespearean genius inspired the ambitions of
G63 1430  6    poets and composers from the time of Shelley and Victor
G63 1440  5    Hugo to that of Bayreuth. It could not really be fulfilled.
G63 1450  3    The conventions into which the romantics tried to breath
G63 1460  1    life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought
G63 1460 10    and feeling. But the attempt itself produced a number
G63 1470  8    of brilliant works, and these form a transition from
G63 1480  6    the early romantic period to the new age of Ibsen and
G63 1490  4    Chekhov.
G63 1490  5    ##
G63 1490  6    The wedding of the Hellenic to the northern genius
G63 1500  2    was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought.
G63 1500 11    His Italian journey was a poet's version of those perennial
G63 1510 10    thrusts across the Alps of the German emperors of the
G63 1520 10    Middle Ages. The dream of a descent into the gardens
G63 1530  7    of the south always drew German ambitions toward Rome
G63 1540  3    and Sicily. Goethe asks in Wilhelm Meister whether
G63 1550  2    we know the land where the lemon trees flower, and
G63 1550 12    the light of the Mediterranean glows through Torquato
G63 1560  7    Tasso and the Roman Elegies. Goethe believed that the
G63 1570  6    Germanic spirit, with its grave strength but flagrant
G63 1580  5    streaks of brutality and intolerance, should be tempered
G63 1590  3    with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the Hellenic.
G63 1600  1    On the narrower ground of poetic form, he felt that
G63 1600 11    in the drama of the future the Greek conception of
G63 1610  8    tragic fate should be joined to the Shakespearean vision
G63 1620  4    of tragic will. The wager between God and Satan brings
G63 1630  3    on the destiny of Faust, but Faust assumes his role
G63 1640  1    voluntarily.
G63 1640  2       The third Act of Faust II is a formal celebration
G63 1650  1    of the union between the Germanic and the classic,
G63 1650 10    between the spirit of Euripides and that of romantic
G63 1660  9    drama. The motif of Faust's love for Helen of Troy
G63 1670  6    goes back to the sources of the Faustian legend. It
G63 1680  3    tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest
G63 1690  1    wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty. There
G63 1690  9    can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her
G63 1700  8    in whom the flesh was all, in whom beauty was entirely
G63 1710  4    pure because it was entirely corruptible. It is thus
G63 1720  2    that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's
G63 1720 10    Faustus. Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends.
G63 1730  9    Faust rescuing Helen from Menelaus' vengeance is the
G63 1740  7    genius of renaissance Europe restoring to life the
G63 1750  5    classic tradition. The necromantic change from the
G63 1760  2    palace at Sparta to Faust's Gothic castle directs us
G63 1760 11    to the aesthetic meaning of the myth- the translation
G63 1770  8    of antique drama into Shakespearean and romantic guise.
G63 1780  5       This translation, or rather the fusion of the two
G63 1790  6    ideals, creates the Gesamtkunstwerk, the "total art
G63 1800  4    form".
