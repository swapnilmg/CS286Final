K25 0010  1    He was in his mid-fifties at this time, long past the
K25 0010 13    establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized
K25 0020  9    yet once again, and it was almost a decade since he
K25 0030  5    had sworn off lecturing. There was never a doubt any
K25 0040  2    more how his structures would be received; it was always
K25 0040 12    the same unqualified success now. He could no longer
K25 0050  8    build anything, whether a private residence in his
K25 0060  6    Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil, without
K25 0070  2    it being obvious that he had done it, and while here
K25 0070 13    and there he was taken to task for again developing
K25 0080  9    the same airy technique, they were such fanciful and
K25 0090  6    sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt
K25 0100  3    assured by its sense of recognition after a time, a
K25 0100 13    quality of authentic uniqueness about them, which,
K25 0110  7    once established by an artist as his private vision,
K25 0120  6    is no longer disputable as to its other values. Stowey
K25 0130  3    Rummel was internationally famous, a crafter of a genuine
K25 0140  1    Americana in foreign eyes, an original designer whose
K25 0140  9    inventive childishness with steel and concrete was
K25 0150  7    made even more believably sincere by his personality.
K25 0160  4    He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone
K25 0170  3    farmhouse with the same wife, a remarkably childish
K25 0170 11    thing in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning,
K25 0180 11    made himself some French coffee, had his corn flakes
K25 0190  7    and more coffee, smoked four cigarettes while reading
K25 0200  3    last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh
K25 0210  2    Gazette, then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes
K25 0220  2    and walked under a vine bower to his workshop. This
K25 0220 12    was an enormously long building whose walls were made
K25 0230  7    of rocks, some of them brought home from every continent
K25 0240  5    during his six years as an oil geologist. The debris
K25 0250  3    of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of
K25 0260  1    wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and
K25 0260 12    a microscope lying on its side on the window sill,
K25 0270  8    vertical steel columns wired for support to the open
K25 0280  4    ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting
K25 0290  1    out into the air, masonry constructions on the floor
K25 0290 10    from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace
K25 0300  6    whose smoke would pass through a whole house, visible
K25 0310  5    all the way up through wire gratings on each floor.
K25 0320  2    His files, desk, drafting board and a high stool formed
K25 0320 12    the only clean island in the chaos. Everywhere else
K25 0330  8    his ideas lay or hung in visible form: his models,
K25 0340  5    drawings, ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his
K25 0350  3    painting days, and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed
K25 0350 12    books that looked as though their insides had been
K25 0360  9    ransacked by a maniac. Bicycle gear-sets he had once
K25 0370  7    used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly
K25 0380  4    Company plant hung on a rope in one corner, and over
K25 0390  1    his desk, next to several old and dusty hats, was a
K25 0390 12    clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used
K25 0400  6    up and down in front of his house. He worked standing,
K25 0410  4    with his left hand in his pocket as though he were
K25 0420  2    merely stopping for a moment, sketching with the surprised
K25 0420 11    stare of one who was watching another person's hand.
K25 0430  9    Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker
K25 0440  7    beside him, sometimes he would look stern and moralistic
K25 0450  5    as his pencil did what he disapproved. It all seemed-
K25 0460  3    if one could have peeked in at him through one of his
K25 0460 15    windows- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular
K25 0470 12    arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying
K25 0480  7    his hand at the boss's work. This air of disengagement
K25 0490  6    carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things,
K25 0500  4    and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a
K25 0510  3    surrender to repetitious routine. But he was not bored
K25 0510 12    at all; he had found his style quite early in his career
K25 0520 11    and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired
K25 0530  6    it, and he could not imagine why he should alter it.
K25 0540  4    There are, after all, fortunate souls who hear everything,
K25 0550  1    but only know how to listen to what is good for them,
K25 0550 13    and Stowey was, as things go, a fortunate man.
K25 0560  8       He left his home the day after New Year's wearing
K25 0570  6    a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat.
K25 0580  4    He would wear this same costume in Florida, despite
K25 0580 13    his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days
K25 0590  9    that he must take some cool clothes with him. But he
K25 0600  8    was too busy to hear what she was saying. So they parted
K25 0610  5    when she was in an impatient humor. When he was bent
K25 0620  3    over behind the wheel of the station wagon, feeling
K25 0620 12    in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he
K25 0630  8    had dropped a moment before, she came out of the house
K25 0640  7    with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head, which
K25 0650  3    she had bought in that country during one of their
K25 0650 13    trips abroad, and handed him a clean handkerchief through
K25 0660  8    the window. Finding the key under his shoe, he started
K25 0670  8    the engine, and while it warmed up he turned to her
K25 0680  5    standing there in the dripping fog, and said, "Defrost
K25 0690  1    the refrigerator".
K25 0690  3       He saw the surprise in her face, and laughed as
K25 0700  3    though it were the funniest expression he had ever
K25 0700 12    seen. He kept on laughing until she started laughing
K25 0710  9    with him. He had a deep voice which was full of good
K25 0720  7    food she had cooked, and good humor; an explosive laugh
K25 0730  4    which always carried everything before it. He would
K25 0740  1    settle himself into his seat to laugh. Whenever he
K25 0740 10    laughed it was all he was doing. And she was made to
K25 0750 10    fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt
K25 0760  5    driveway standing in the cold fog, mad as she was at
K25 0770  2    his going away when he really didn't have to, mad at
K25 0770 13    their both having got older in a life that seemed to
K25 0780 10    have taken no more than a week to go by. She was forty-nine
K25 0790  9    at this time, a lanky woman of breeding with an austere,
K25 0800  4    narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple
K25 0810  1    or some architecture that had been designed long ago
K25 0810 10    for a stubborn sort of prayer. Her eyebrows were definite
K25 0820  8    and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward
K25 0830  5    a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that
K25 0840  2    fell to her shoulders. There was an air of blindness
K25 0840 12    in her gray eyes, the startled-horse look that ultimately
K25 0850  9    comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral
K25 0860 10    line long since divorced from money-making and which,
K25 0870  5    besides, has kept its estate intact. She was personally
K25 0880  2    sloppy, and when she had colds would blow her nose
K25 0880 12    in the same handkerchief all day and keep it, soaking
K25 0890  9    wet, dangling from her waist, and when she gardened
K25 0900  6    she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves. But just
K25 0910  3    when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of
K25 0910 13    peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed,
K25 0920  8    brushed, and taking breaths of air, and even with her
K25 0930  8    broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table
K25 0940  5    or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy, a grace of history,
K25 0950  1    so to speak, and for an instant one saw how ferociously
K25 0950 12    proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal
K25 0960  9    value. She even spoke differently when she was clean,
K25 0970  6    and she was clean now for his departure and her voice
K25 0980  4    clear and rather sharp.
K25 0980  8       "Now drive carefully, for God's sake"! she called,
K25 0990  6    trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his
K25 1000  4    departure. But he did not notice, and was already backing
K25 1010  2    the car down to the road, saying "Toot-toot"! to the
K25 1020  1    stump of a tree as he passed it, the same stump which
K25 1020 13    had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty
K25 1030 10    years and which he refused to have removed. She stood
K25 1040  5    clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had
K25 1050  3    swung the car onto the road. Then, when he had it pointed
K25 1060  1    down the hill, he stopped to gaze at her through the
K25 1060 12    window. She had begun to turn back toward the house,
K25 1070  8    but his look caught her and she stood still, waiting
K25 1080  3    there for what his expression indicated would be a
K25 1100  1    serious word of farewell. He looked at her out of himself,
K25 1100 12    she thought, as he did only for an instant at a time,
K25 1110 11    the look which always surprised her even now when his
K25 1120  6    uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath
K25 1130  3    came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs, the look
K25 1130 12    of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring
K25 1140  9    at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once. Now she
K25 1150  8    kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and
K25 1160  5    sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger
K25 1170  1    and said "Toot"! once more and roared off into the
K25 1170 11    fog, his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness
K25 1180  7    with which it pressed the accelerator, just as his
K25 1190  6    hand did when he worked. She walked back to the house
K25 1200  4    and entered, feeling herself returning, sensing some
K25 1200 11    kind of opportunity in the empty building. There is
K25 1210  9    a death in all partings, she knew, and promptly put
K25 1220  6    it out of her mind.
K25 1220 11       She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up
K25 1230  8    talking and dancing and drinking all night, but it
K25 1240  5    always seemed to her that being alone, especially alone
K25 1250  2    in her house, was the realest part of life. Now she
K25 1250 13    could let out the three parakeets without fear they
K25 1260  7    would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out
K25 1270  5    one of the doors; she could dust the plants, then break
K25 1280  3    off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from
K25 1280 14    the middle on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and
K25 1300  9    finally, the best part of all, simply sit at the plank
K25 1310  7    table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the
K25 1320  3    newspapers, reading the ads as well as the news, registering
K25 1330  1    nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself
K25 1330 11    above all wishing and desire. She did this now, comfortably
K25 1340  8    aware of the mist running down the windows, of the
K25 1350  6    silence outside, of the dark afternoon it was getting
K25 1360  4    to be. She fell asleep leaning on her hand, hearing
K25 1360 14    the house creaking as though it were a living a private
K25 1370 11    life of its own these two hundred years, hearing the
K25 1380  7    birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring
K25 1390  4    of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked
K25 1400  2    across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm.
K25 1400 13    Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to
K25 1410 10    review things: Stowey, yes, was on his way south, and
K25 1420  8    the two boys were away in school, and nothing was burning
K25 1430  4    on the stove, and Lucretia was coming for dinner and
K25 1440  2    bringing three guests of hers. Then she fell asleep
K25 1440 11    again as soddenly as a person with fever, and when
K25 1450  8    she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back
K25 1460  6    in her eyes. She stood up, smoothing her hair down,
K25 1470  2    straightening her clothes, feeling a thankfulness for
K25 1470  9    the enveloping darkness outside, and, above everything
K25 1480  6    else, for the absence of the need to answer, to respond,
K25 1490  7    to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out,
K25 1500  4    and yet, now that she was beginning to cook, she glimpsed
K25 1510  1    a future without him, a future alone like this, and
K25 1510 11    the pain made her head writhe, and in a moment she
K25 1520  8    found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her
K25 1530  5    guests. She went into the living room and turned on
K25 1540  1    three lamps, then back into the kitchen where she turned
K25 1540 11    on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods
K25 1550  9    on the barn, illuminating the driveway. She knew she
K25 1560  6    was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself.
K25 1570  2    They were both so young, after all, so unready for
K25 1570 12    any final parting. How could it have been thirty years
K25 1580  9    already, she wondered? But yes, nineteen plus thirty
K25 1590  6    was forty-nine, and she was forty-nine and she had
K25 1600  4    been married at nineteen. She stood still over the
K25 1600 13    leg of lamb, rubbing herbs into it, quite suddenly
K25 1610  9    conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling
K25 1620  7    of wrath, a sensation of violence that started her
K25 1630  2    shivering.
