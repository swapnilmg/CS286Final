B05 0010  4    @ IF THE Dominican Republic achieves free, democratic
B05 0020  3    government, it will be due in large part to the U.S.
B05 0030  1    show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent
B05 0030 10    a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.
B05 0040  5       Outwardly, Ciudad Trujillo is calm. None of the
B05 0050  7    Trujillo family remains. Mr. Balaguer is in control,
B05 0060  5    and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect
B05 0070  3    his offer of a coalition government preliminary to
B05 0070 11    free elections in the spring.
B05 0080  4       Had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican
B05 0090  3    coast, there is every possibility that the country
B05 0090 11    would now be wracked by civil war. Ultimately either
B05 0100  9    the Trujillos would have been returned to power or
B05 0110  7    the conflict would have produced conditions favorable
B05 0120  2    to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro
B05 0130  1    in Cuba.
B05 0130  3       Within the Organization of American States, there
B05 0140  2    may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention
B05 0150  1    which was not without risk obviously. But there was
B05 0150 10    no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined
B05 0160  6    Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting, "Vive Yankees"!
B05 0170  4    More, the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition
B05 0180  5    leader, Dr. Juan Bosch, as having saved "many lives
B05 0190  3    and many troubles in the near future".
B05 0190 10       Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over. He
B05 0200  9    will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate,
B05 0210  7    finally, the forces of authoritarianism, pro-Trujillo
B05 0220  3    and pro-Castro alike. In cooperating toward that objective,
B05 0230  3    OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated
B05 0240  2    by the United States. @
B05 0240  7    #MATTER OF SURVIVAL#
B05 0240 10    @ THOSE watching the growing rivalry between craft
B05 0250  8    unions and industrial unions may recognize all the
B05 0260  6    pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935.
B05 0270  4       Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. Craft unions
B05 0280  2    seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory
B05 0280 11    maintenance.
B05 0290  1       The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark
B05 0290 10    secession from the American Federation of Labor of
B05 0300  8    its industrial union members. That breach was healed
B05 0310  6    20 years later by merger of the American Federation
B05 0320  2    of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
B05 0330  1    Or that's what it looked like at the time.
B05 0330 10       But automation and the increasing complexity of
B05 0340  6    factories has renewed the competition for jobs. Walter
B05 0350  4    Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction of
B05 0360  2    the AFL-CIO, says another two years of this squabbling
B05 0370  1    will be disastrous for all American labor.
B05 0370  8       Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor
B05 0380  7    as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters, is a matter
B05 0390  5    of conjecture. But the jurisdictional disputes that
B05 0400  2    result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win
B05 0400 11    friends for labor.
B05 0410  2       Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as
B05 0410 13    a condition of national survival, this country can
B05 0420  7    have little patience with labor's family feuds. The
B05 0430  5    concept of labor as a special class is outmoded, and
B05 0440  3    in the task confronting America as bastion of the free
B05 0450  1    world, labor must learn to put the national interest
B05 0450 10    first if it is itself to survive. @
B05 0460  4    #DETERRENT#
B05 0460  5    @ THE Army, Navy and Air Force, among others, may question
B05 0470  6    Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United
B05 0480  6    States agriculture is the "strongest deterrent" to
B05 0490  3    the spread of communism. But the secretary insists
B05 0490 11    that the success of the American farmer is the "greatest
B05 0500 10    single source of strength" in the struggle to insure
B05 0510  8    freedom around the world.
B05 0520  1       Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he
B05 0520 11    visited on a recent world trade trip people were more
B05 0530  9    awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses
B05 0540  5    than by our industrial production- or even by the Soviet's
B05 0550  5    successes in space. This shouldn't surprise the secretary;
B05 0560  3    American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses
B05 0570  1    for a long, long time.
B05 0570  6       In fact, over the years, the American farmer's capacity
B05 0580  3    to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar.
B05 0590  2    And thus far, Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief.
B05 0600  1       The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary
B05 0600  9    sponsored, has been declared a billion dollar fiasco.
B05 0610  8    In exchange for higher price supports, growers pledged
B05 0620  4    reduction in planted acreage. But the farmers outsmarted
B05 0630  3    Washington by shortening the distance between the rows
B05 0640  2    and pouring on the fertilizer.
B05 0640  7       The result: $1.1 billion added to the deficit in
B05 0650  6    the federal budget. Perhaps, as Mr. Freeman says, American
B05 0660  3    agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also
B05 0670  1    swindling the American taxpayer. @
B05 0670  6    #WHAT'S WRONG AT STATE#
B05 0670 10    @ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington
B05 0690  1    has been going over the State Department and has reached
B05 0690 11    some predictable conclusions. The department needs
B05 0700  6    a clearer "sense of direction" at the top and it needs
B05 0710  8    fewer, but better, people, Sen. Jackson says.
B05 0720  3       The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the
B05 0730  2    effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy
B05 0730  8    has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance.
B05 0740  6       But those who would revitalize so complex an organization
B05 0750  6    must, first of all, overcome the resistance of layers
B05 0760  4    of officials wedded to traditional procedures, suspicious
B05 0770  2    of innovation and fearful of mistakes.
B05 0770  8       Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation
B05 0780  6    created by the presence in the White House of a corps
B05 0790  7    of presidential assistants engaged in the study of
B05 0800  3    foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion
B05 0810  1    and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore
B05 0810 12    vigor and initiative among his subordinates.
B05 0820  5       But competent observers believe he is making progress,
B05 0830  5    particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the
B05 0840  4    primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our
B05 0850  1    vital national interests lie and what we must do to
B05 0850 11    promote them".
B05 0860  1       The Jackson report will provide some of the political
B05 0860 10    support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department
B05 0870 13    personnel engaged, as Sen. Jackson puts it, "in work
B05 0880  9    that does not really need doing". Mr. Rusk should also
B05 0890  7    draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that
B05 0900  3    congressional methods of dealing with national security
B05 0910  2    problems be improved. Self-criticism is a rare but
B05 0910 11    needed commodity in Congress. @
B05 0920  5    #BETTING MEN#
B05 0920  7    @ FORECASTING economic activity is a hazardous undertaking
B05 0930  7    even for the specialist. But now apparently the job
B05 0940  6    of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to
B05 0950  4    risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment
B05 0960  1    trends.
B05 0960  2       James P. Mitchell, when he was the head of the department,
B05 0970  1    promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop
B05 0970 10    below three million a couple of years ago. He lost,
B05 0980 10    but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora.
B05 0990  7       His successor, Secretary Goldberg, also has been
B05 1000  4    guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which
B05 1010  1    has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last
B05 1010 12    11 months. No betting man, Mr. Goldberg says he's merely
B05 1020  8    "putting my neck out again" by predicting the rate
B05 1030  6    will go down this month. He is basing his guess on
B05 1040  4    new government statistics that show business has broadened
B05 1050  1    its stride- a new record high in personal income, an
B05 1050 11    increase in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales
B05 1060  9    and a gain in orders for durable goods.
B05 1070  3       Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the steel
B05 1080  2    strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr.
B05 1080 10    Goldberg has less reason for missing. The economy seems
B05 1090  9    to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane
B05 1100  8    season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't
B05 1110  5    be blamed in November. The odds thus appear favorable
B05 1120  1    that the secretary's neck may be spared. @
B05 1120  9    #LITTLE RESISTANCE#
B05 1130  1    @ CAMBODIA'S chief of state, who has been accused of
B05 1140  1    harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making
B05 1140  7    life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand,
B05 1150  7    insists he would be very unhappy if communism established
B05 1160  5    its power in Southeast Asia.
B05 1170  1       But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph
B05 1170  8    is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the
B05 1180 10    towel. "I have to see the facts", is the way the prince
B05 1190  7    puts it. And from that point of vantage he concedes
B05 1200  3    another two years of grace to nations maintaining a
B05 1200 12    pro-Western posture.
B05 1210  2       Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some
B05 1220  2    day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise
B05 1220 13    the courage of his convictions.
B05 1240  1    #BOTTOM SIGHTED#
B05 1240  3    @ COMMERCE Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast
B05 1250  3    in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's
B05 1250 11    economic forecasters. Weeks ago he saw a business upturn
B05 1260  9    in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues
B05 1270  8    in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement.
B05 1280  5    Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary
B05 1290  3    Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges' appraisal,
B05 1300  1    though there has been some reluctance to do so at the
B05 1300 12    White House.
B05 1310  2       And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the
B05 1320  1    economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks
B05 1320  9    business has stopped sliding and that it should start
B05 1330  7    going upward from this point. He is the first top administration
B05 1340  6    officer to see the bottom of the slump.
B05 1350  1       The secretary based his assessment on the upturn
B05 1350  9    in retail sales. February's volume was 1 per cent above
B05 1360  9    January's for the first pickup since last October,
B05 1370  6    although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February
B05 1380  4    1960.
B05 1380  5       Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal
B05 1390  4    Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase
B05 1400  1    in the nation's department stores for the week ending
B05 1400 10    March 4. In Newark, for example, this gain was put
B05 1410  9    at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level. Of course,
B05 1420  6    some of the credit for the sale boost must be given
B05 1430  4    to improvement in the weather and to the fact that
B05 1430 14    Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.
B05 1440 10       Another optimistic sign, this one from the Labor
B05 1450  7    Department, was the report that the long rise in unemployment
B05 1460  6    compensation payments "was interrupted for the first
B05 1470  4    time in the week ending Feb. 25". Initial claims for
B05 1480  2    jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100
B05 1480 11    in the week ending March 4.
B05 1490  4       Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he
B05 1500  3    doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income
B05 1500 15    taxes. Well, we can't have everything. Prosperity for
B05 1510  8    the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut.

B05 1520  9    #IN NEW JERSEY, TOO#
B05 1520 13    @ NEW JERSEY folk need not be told of the builder's
B05 1530 11    march to the sea, for in a single generation he has
B05 1540 10    parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses
B05 1550  6    on to develop the few open spaces that remain. Now
B05 1560  3    the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic
B05 1560 12    attraction for exotic herons, is threatened, but the
B05 1570  8    battlefront extends far beyond our state.
B05 1580  5       Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation
B05 1590  3    of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract at
B05 1600  2    Stone Harbor may seem unimportant. But Interior Secretary
B05 1600 10    Udall warns that there is a race on between those who
B05 1610 11    would develop our few surviving open shorelines and
B05 1620  5    those who would save them for the enjoyment of all
B05 1630  3    as public preserves.
B05 1630  6       The move for establishment of a national seashore
B05 1640  5    park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown
B05 1650  1    to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's
B05 1650  8    interest in that area. But preservation of the natural
B05 1660  9    beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern,
B05 1670  7    for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot
B05 1680  3    of people from all over the country.
B05 1680 10       By comparison, Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies
B05 1690  6    seem less formidable, for aside from the Audubon Society,
B05 1700  7    they are mostly the snowy, common and cattle egrets
B05 1710  5    and the Louisiana, green, little blue and black-crowned
B05 1720  3    herons who nest and feed there. But there is hope,
B05 1720 13    for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the
B05 1730  7    sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include
B05 1740  9    in its program to double its park space.
B05 1750  3       The desirability of preserving such places as the
B05 1760  1    Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more
B05 1760  9    apparent every year. Public sentiment for conserving
B05 1770  6    our rich natural heritage is growing. But that heritage
B05 1780  5    is shrinking even faster. @

B05 1800  1    may have held for some prospective applicants has been
B05 1800 10    removed by Sargent Shriver, the head corpsman. Anybody
B05 1810  6    who is expecting a joyride should, according to Mr.
B05 1820  5    Shriver, get off the train right now.
B05 1830  1       First of all, the recruits will have to undergo
B05 1830 10    arduous schooling. It will be a 16-hour training day.
