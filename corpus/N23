N23 0010  1    Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining
N23 0010  9    five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker
N23 0020  7    back of the chair, the eyes dead on him as the life
N23 0030  6    finally went out of the brute. The body continued to
N23 0040  2    lash, but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork
N23 0040 14    the loathsome, bloody mass out of the bungalow. He
N23 0050  8    slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up,
N23 0060  6    alarmed at the sound of the shots. He heard their chattering,
N23 0070  3    and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered
N23 0080  1    the snake right on the porch with wood axes.
N23 0080 10       It was only then that he turned to look at Penny.
N23 0090  8       She was sitting on the edge of the bed again, back
N23 0100  6    in the same position where the snake had found her.
N23 0110  2    The fear had not entirely gone from her face, but there
N23 0110 13    were some other emotions now, crowding into her eyes
N23 0120  8    and the lines of her mouth.
N23 0130  1       But her hands were calm, now. She's got guts, thought
N23 0140  1    Keith. She's got more guts than any other woman in
N23 0140 11    the world.
N23 0150  1       "Keith", said Penny, "Keith, you were wonderful.
N23 0150  8    I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband
N23 0160 11    for saving her life, but I am. Thank you, Keith".
N23 0170  9       He smiled at her sincerity. And for the hundredth
N23 0180  6    time that week, he was startled at her beauty. Strange.
N23 0190  3    Seven years they'd been married. He knew her mind pretty
N23 0200  3    well, by now, its quick perceptions and sympathies,
N23 0200 11    its painful insistence on truth and directness, its
N23 0210  7    capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate,
N23 0220  8    even in part. But her beauty always surprised him anew.
N23 0230  4       "I realize that this is hardly the time to say it,
N23 0240  4    Penny", said Keith. "But knowing you, I know that you're
N23 0250  2    glad to be alive, and grateful- and sorry because I
N23 0250 12    killed the snake, even though I had to. Isn't that
N23 0260 10    so"?
N23 0260 11       Penny lowered her eyes.
N23 0270  4       "Yes", she said, almost in a whisper, as if admitting
N23 0280  4    to a crime.
N23 0280  7       "The snake was beautiful, wasn't it"? asked Keith,
N23 0290  4    his voice getting harsher in spite of himself, as he
N23 0300  3    struggled to control his growing anger. "It was a king
N23 0310  1    cobra, the largest you ever saw, and it deserved to
N23 0310 11    live out its life in the jungle, didn't it? DIDN'T
N23 0320  7    IT?"
N23 0330  1       Penny did not answer. Now, she just sat there looking
N23 0340 10    at him, without an expression except concern for him.
N23 0350  5       "We're all God's creatures, aren't we"? Keith was
N23 0360  5    snarling now. "All of us- every goddam roach and worm
N23 0370  5    and killer in that jungle. You love this village and
N23 0380  2    these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures,
N23 0390  1    too. And you love Ahmiri, that black bastard of a servant
N23 0390 12    even a little more, because he's a beautiful man. And
N23 0400 10    he loves you because you're a beautiful woman. We're
N23 0410  6    all God's creatures, aren't we, Penny? All of us, that
N23 0420  7    is, except me. You hate me, you hate my guts, because
N23 0430  5    I like to hunt. You actually hate me- and we both know
N23 0440  3    it- because I killed that filthy snake. ... Well, why
N23 0440 13    don't you say something"?
N23 0450  3       Penny would not rise to his mood.
N23 0460  1       "There isn't anything left to say, is there, Keith"?
N23 0460 10       She softly let herself into the bed, and took her
N23 0470 11    regular side, away from the door, where she slept better
N23 0480  9    because Keith was between her and the invader. He knew
N23 0490  7    she was not sulking, not even angry at him. Just as
N23 0500  4    he knew that she had stopped loving him.
N23 0500 12       The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland
N23 0510  7    of the world, the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas
N23 0520  6    that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet.
N23 0530  6    For a brief period each year, the rays of the sun are
N23 0540  4    warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile
N23 0540 15    deep at the base of the headwalls, and then the pinnacles
N23 0550 11    glisten in the daytime at high noon, and billions of
N23 0560  8    gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the
N23 0570  4    glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys
N23 0580  1    on their long, meandering journey to the sea- running
N23 0580 10    east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata
N23 0590  7    and Kemchenjunga, then turning south and curling down
N23 0600  5    through the jungles of Assam, past the Khasi Hills,
N23 0610  2    and into Bengal, past Sirinjani and Madaripur, until
N23 0610 10    the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the
N23 0620 10    soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld
N23 0630  8    with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal.
N23 0640  4       Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra
N23 0650  1    more times than he could remember, during the war days
N23 0650 11    when he flew over the Hump of the world, thinking it
N23 0660 11    high adventure in those times before man was guiding
N23 0670  6    himself through outer space. But Keith looked down
N23 0680  3    more than up. He thought of the jungles below him,
N23 0680 13    and of the wild, strange, untracked beauty there and
N23 0690  9    he promised himself that someday he would return, on
N23 0700  7    foot perhaps, to hunt in this last corner of the world
N23 0710  4    where man is sometimes himself the hunted, and animals
N23 0720  1    the lords.
N23 0720  3       At first it had been just a romantic dream of his,
N23 0730  1    the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the
N23 0730 11    war. But "after the war" was a luxury of a phrase he
N23 0740 10    did not permit himself. Wing Commanders in the RAF
N23 0750  5    do not imply survival in the future either in their
N23 0760  3    orders or in their attitudes, to their men or to themselves.
N23 0770  1    And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen
N23 0770 12    to- a man paradoxically, who might even survive. He
N23 0780  8    became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump
N23 0790  7    in the big crates. The RAF was Britain's weapon of
N23 0800  3    attrition, and flying a fighter plane was the way her
N23 0810  2    sons could serve her best at this point in the war.
N23 0810 13       He knew how to shoot down Nazis. And he knew that
N23 0820 10    the men talked about him behind his back, saying that
N23 0830  6    he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot
N23 0840  3    of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was
N23 0850  1    chemically incapable of fear. That was true, but only
N23 0850 10    half the truth. The other half he didn't like to recognize,
N23 0860  9    even to himself. He enjoyed the killing. Not defending
N23 0870  6    England, or being an ace, or fighting for humanity.
N23 0880  3    He enjoyed killing. And he would have enjoyed it just
N23 0890  2    as much if he had been a Nazi.
N23 0890 10       Nowadays, we talk as though the blitz were just
N23 0900  5    a short skirmish. The Nazis bombed Britain, so the
N23 0910  3    RAF retaliated and shot them all down. Not quite.
N23 0910 12    It was a war of nerves, of stamina, of dogged endurance
N23 0920 11    in which the stupid insistence of the British on their
N23 0930  7    right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable
N23 0940  4    obstacle to the Nazis, who were better organized and
N23 0950  3    technically superior. It took a long time before the
N23 0960  1    British tipped the balance.
N23 0960  5       Keith learned too much about air combat, and air
N23 0970  4    killing, to be risked. They grounded him (over his
N23 0970 13    protests- not including his true reason for wanting
N23 0980 10    to fly) and put him in the Command offices.
N23 1000  5       That was where he met Penny.
N23 1010  1       He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking
N23 1010 10    American WAC, a second lieutenant assigned to do the
N23 1020  8    paper work, (regardless of how important she might
N23 1030  4    have thought she was) in the Command offices, but that
N23 1040  3    was all. Penny knew him better, on her part. He had
N23 1040 14    a war reputation, but this was the kind of man women
N23 1050 10    like even without medals. They don't go for bull-like
N23 1060  7    muscle, as a rule. He had strength in his six-foot
N23 1070  5    frame, but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier.
N23 1080  1    He was on the thin side, with big hands, and the kind
N23 1080 13    of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep.
N23 1090  9       His hair was black, already greying at the temples
N23 1100  6    in the classic beauty-idiom, the only one permitted
N23 1110  3    to a man. The pretty little twittering WACS said he
N23 1120  2    had the look of eagles- and Penny, hating the cliche,
N23 1120 12    had to admit that in this case it applied. Keith was
N23 1130 10    an eagle.
N23 1130 12       Penny and Keith had no romance. No dates or hand-holding.
N23 1140 11    But they met in one searing moment that gave them to
N23 1150  9    one another instantly.
N23 1160  1       The Command offices were in the border country,
N23 1160  9    up north, where the radar systems centralized their
N23 1170  5    intelligence reports, and the fighters were dispatched
N23 1180  3    to harry the enemy. The Nazis knew this, of course,
N23 1190  1    and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers,
N23 1190 10    they let a few drop every time they went over, hoping
N23 1200 10    for a lucky hit.
N23 1210  1       This time, they had been lucky. The Command post
N23 1210  9    was underground, and well camouflaged. But there hadn't
N23 1220  6    been enough time to build it for keeps. There was a
N23 1230  5    measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling,
N23 1240  2    but the engineers who hastily installed it were well
N23 1240 11    aware that concrete is not much better than prayer,
N23 1250  8    if as efficacious, when a direct hit comes along.
N23 1260  5       This one was actually more of a "near miss". The
N23 1270  3    bomb plunged into the ground near the Post, but not
N23 1280  1    precisely into the Command room itself. There was a
N23 1280 10    shattering, cracking sound as the concrete started
N23 1290  6    to buckle, the air filled with dust and flying debris,
N23 1300  4    and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor
N23 1310  2    and used the desks as turtlebacks, as ordered.
N23 1310 10       That is, everyone but Keith and Penny.
N23 1320  6       They stood there, just the two of them, in the rocking,
N23 1330  6    shattering blast. Keith was on his feet because he
N23 1340  2    didn't care at all about life any more: Penny on her
N23 1340 13    feet, proudly, because she cared too much.
N23 1350  7       The bomb was a solitary one. The blast damaged,
N23 1360  5    but did not destroy the room. Keith's eyes met Penny's
N23 1370  3    as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction.
N23 1380  1    And, as the others began to crawl out from beneath
N23 1380 11    the desks and tend to those wounded, and mark the several
N23 1390 10    killed, he climbed across the debris to Penny and took
N23 1400  7    her hand in his.
N23 1400 11       The chaplain married them, on the next day.
N23 1410  7       After the war, Penny had wanted Keith at least to
N23 1420  5    visit her home with her. She came from Ohio, from what
N23 1430  3    she called a "small farm" of two hundred acres, as
N23 1430 13    indeed it was to farmer-type farmers. But to Keith's
N23 1440 10    London-bred mind, such acreage sounded rather invincible.
N23 1450  6    It wasn't that, however, which decided them not to
N23 1460  5    go to America. Keith told Penny about his dream to
N23 1470  3    return to India and Burma. He stressed the wild beauty
N23 1470 13    of the mountains, and the jungles. He didn't tell her
N23 1480 10    the truth he now freely admitted to himself. He couldn't
N23 1490  7    stop killing. That was his true love, not Penny. The
N23 1500  6    terrible power of a gun, the thing that blasted the
N23 1510  3    soul out of a living body, man or beast, was one he
N23 1510 15    never wanted to lose. And in the hunting land, this
N23 1520 10    hunger was considered to be a noble thing.
N23 1530  6       When they got to Shillong, in Assam, he was happy.
N23 1540  4    This is a paradise for hunters. This was the land of
N23 1540 15    the sladang, the great water buffalo with horns forty
N23 1550  9    inches across the spread. The great black leopards.
N23 1560  6    The sambur buck, the jungle stag that is even more
N23 1570  5    noble than the Scottish elk. He even hunted elephant,
N23 1580  1    although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious
N23 1580 10    as his African cousin. But there are big rogues in
N23 1590  8    both countries. These were the ones Keith sought out-
N23 1600  6    the loners, the ones who killed for the joy of it,
N23 1610  4    like himself.
N23 1610  6       He and Penny would go out on tame elephants, raised
N23 1620  2    from babyhood in the keddah. And while he was ever
N23 1630  1    alert for game, and most particularly a tiger, Penny
N23 1630 10    marvelled at the Eden they were traversing. They came
N23 1640  7    upon cheetal deer at woodland pools. Peacocks strutted
N23 1650  4    across their path, preening. There were fantastic flowers
N23 1660  2    without perfume, and gaudy birds without song. Mouse
N23 1670  1    deer played around the feet of the elephants, or fled
N23 1670 11    when the mighty legs thrashed too close. Wild boar
N23 1680  7    watched their progress with little pig eyes, and grunted
N23 1690  5    derision when they didn't consider such game worthy
N23 1700  2    of a shot from the .404's.
