F35 0010  1       To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they
F35 0010 13    felt at home was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em
F35 0020  8    scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called "loose
F35 0030  8    herdin'". To hold 'em in a compact mass was "close
F35 0040  6    herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory
F35 0050  4    with which they were acquainted. That became their
F35 0060  1    "home range". Yet there were always some that moved
F35 0060 10    farther and farther out, seekin' grass and water. These
F35 0070  8    became "strays", the term bein' restricted to cattle,
F35 0080  7    however, as hosses, under like circumstances, were
F35 0090  3    spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".
F35 0100  1       Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till
F35 0100 11    it was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with
F35 0110 12    'em or wait till the storm was over, and follow. Such
F35 0120  9    marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a "drift",
F35 0130  6    or "winter drift", and if the storm was prolonged it
F35 0140  4    usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range.
F35 0150  2    The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference
F35 0150 10    to the number of them animals. The single animal or
F35 0160  8    a small bunch were referred to as "strays"; but when
F35 0170  6    a large number were "bunched up" or "banded up", and
F35 0180  5    marched away from their home range, as long as they
F35 0190  2    stayed together the group was said to be a "drift".
F35 0190 12    Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape
F35 0200 10    the severe cold winds, but it could also occur in summer
F35 0210  8    as the result of lack of water or grass because of
F35 0220  4    a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts
F35 0230  1    usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough
F35 0230 10    sense to avoid 'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.
F35 0240  8       The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards,
F35 0250  9    and sometimes droughts, over a wide range of territory
F35 0260  6    was called a "die-up". Followin' such an event there
F35 0270  4    was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the ranchers
F35 0280  2    needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle
F35 0290  1    were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that
F35 0290 10    is, caught in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift
F35 0300 11    fence" durin' a storm. Cattle which died from them
F35 0310  7    winter storms were referred to as the "winter kill".
F35 0320  4    When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs
F35 0330  2    up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used
F35 0330 14    by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight,
F35 0340 11    as one cowhand was heard to say, "He arches his back
F35 0350  8    like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle drove to the northern
F35 0360  5    ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into
F35 0370  3    prime beef were said to be "double wintered".
F35 0380  1       Cattle brought into a range from a distance were
F35 0380  9    called "immigrants". Them new to the country were referred
F35 0390  8    to as "pilgrims". This word was first applied to the
F35 0400  7    imported hot-blooded cattle, but later was more commonly
F35 0410  4    used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle
F35 0420  1    were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle",
F35 0430  1    and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse
F35 0430 11    stock" to them newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein
F35 0440  6    cattle weren't a beef breed, they were rarely seen
F35 0450  5    on a ranch, though one might be found now and then
F35 0460  2    for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of
F35 0460 12    cattle "magpies". A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring
F35 0470  7    of buffalo and cattle. "Dry stock" denoted, regardless
F35 0490  5    of age or sex, such bovines as were givin' no milk.
F35 0500  6    A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made up entirely
F35 0510  3    of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin'
F35 0520  1    milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk
F35 0520 11    was a "milk pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed
F35 0530  8    as "strippers". The terminology of the range, in speakin'
F35 0540  8    of "dry stock" and "wet stock", was confusin' to the
F35 0550  7    tenderfoot. The most common reference to "wet stock"
F35 0560  4    was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled
F35 0570  3    across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their
F35 0580  1    rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied
F35 0580 10    to all stolen animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of
F35 0590  8    mixed sexes, while a "straight steer herd" was one
F35 0600  5    composed entirely of steers, and when the cowman spoke
F35 0610  3    of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades,
F35 0620  1    ages, and sexes.
F35 0620  4       In the spring when penned cattle were turned out
F35 0630  2    to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or
F35 0630 13    "put to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle
F35 0640  9    out of a corral onto the range. When a cow came out
F35 0650 11    of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to "come
F35 0660  7    out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle up and get 'em heated
F35 0670  6    and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and the act
F35 0680  3    was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin' 'em".
F35 0690  2    After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside
F35 0690 12    brands toward their home range was called "throwin'
F35 0700  8    over".
F35 0720  1       A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the
F35 0720 12    time her hindquarters were in a standin' position,
F35 0730  6    her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude.
F35 0740  2    It was when she was in this position that the name
F35 0750  1    "prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were
F35 0750 10    said to be "on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof"
F35 0760  9    was a reference to live cattle and was also used in
F35 0770  9    referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their
F35 0780  5    own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin' cattle
F35 0790  2    by train was called a "stock run". A general classification
F35 0800  1    given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".
F35 0800  7       When a cowboy spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant
F35 0810  8    that he throwed dust into her eyes. The cow, unlike
F35 0820  5    a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her mind on
F35 0830  3    her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod"
F35 0830 13    or "on the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than
F35 0840 10    any of his other charges.
F35 0850  2       The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many
F35 0860  1    of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association
F35 0860 10    with the Injun on the trails. The first cattle the
F35 0870  8    Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox
F35 0880  6    teams of the early freighters. Listenin' with wonder
F35 0890  3    at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted
F35 0900  1    "Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the
F35 0910  1    names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws".
F35 0910 10    Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country
F35 0920 10    on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive
F35 0930  7    demand for "wohaw".
F35 0930 10       "Tailin'" was the throwin' of an animal by the tail
F35 0940 10    in lieu of a rope. Any animal could when travelin'
F35 0950  7    fast, be sent heels over head by the simple process
F35 0960  5    of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, and givin'
F35 0970  3    the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal
F35 0980  1    off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and
F35 0980 11    shoulders. Though the slightest yank was frequently
F35 0990  6    capable of producin' results, many men assured success
F35 1000  4    through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn, supplemented
F35 1010  3    sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave
F35 1020  1    of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics
F35 1020 11    were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns,
F35 1030  8    and a thorough "tailin'" usually knocked the breath
F35 1040  6    out of a steer, and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for
F35 1050  6    the rest of the day. It required both a quick and swift
F35 1060  5    hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more valuable,
F35 1070  2    ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was
F35 1070 11    discontinued, at least when the boss was 'round. When
F35 1080  9    the cowboy used the word "tailin's", he meant stragglers.
F35 1090  5       "Bull tailin'" was a game once pop'lar with the
F35 1100  8    Mexican cowboys of Texas. From a pen of wild bulls
F35 1110  6    one would be released, and with much yellin' a cowhand'd
F35 1120  2    take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed
F35 1130  1    his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin'
F35 1130 11    the bull off balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific
F35 1140  7    force. Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the
F35 1150  8    ground to hold 'im down was called "peggin'".
F35 1160  2       Colors of cattle came in for their special names.
F35 1170  1    An animal covered with splotches or spots of different
F35 1170 10    colors was called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback"
F35 1180  8    was an animal with a stripe of different color from
F35 1190  8    the rest of its body runnin' down its back, while a
F35 1200  6    "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or brown stripe
F35 1210  3    runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic
F35 1220  1    of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or
F35 1220 11    steer of the longhorn type, with lines and dots of
F35 1230  9    a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes,
F35 1240  7    face, and nose. Such an animal was said to be "mealynosed".
F35 1250  5    "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to describe cattle
F35 1260  3    of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'. The
F35 1270  2    northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which
F35 1270 11    went up the trail "Sonora reds", while they called
F35 1280  8    all cattle drove up from Mexico "yaks", because they
F35 1290  5    came from the Yaqui Injun country, or gave 'em the
F35 1300  5    name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern border,
F35 1310  2    cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration
F35 1310 10    was black with a lineback, with white speckles frequently
F35 1320  8    appearin' on the sides and belly, were called "zorrillas".
F35 1330  7    This word was from the Spanish, meanin' "polecat".
F35 1340  4    "Yeller bellies" were cattle of Mexican breed splotched
F35 1350  5    on flank and belly with yellerish color. An animal
F35 1360  2    with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished
F35 1370  1    and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes
F35 1370 11    used as a "marker". Such an animal has frequently been
F35 1380  8    the downfall of the rustler.
F35 1390  2       Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was
F35 1400  1    found on the range and driftin' it back so that it
F35 1400 12    didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a "range
F35 1410  8    count". The countin' of cattle in a pasture without
F35 1420  7    throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a
F35 1430  4    "pasture count". The counters rode through the pasture
F35 1440  2    countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted
F35 1440 10    it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted
F35 1450 10    cattle ahead. This method of countin' was usually done
F35 1460  7    at the request, and in the presence, of a representative
F35 1470  4    of the bank that held the papers against the herd.
F35 1480  2    Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle
F35 1480 11    paper".
F35 1490  1       A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the
F35 1490 11    books, commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes
F35 1500  9    much to the profit of the seller. This led to the famous
F35 1510  8    sayin' in the Northwest of the "books won't freeze".
F35 1520  4    This became a common byword durin' the boom days when
F35 1530  4    Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle
F35 1540  1    interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to
F35 1540 10    a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon
F35 1550  9    was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen,
F35 1560  4    and one year durin' a severe blizzard, when his herd-owner
F35 1570  5    customers were wearin' long faces, he said, "Cheer
F35 1580  2    up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze".
F35 1580 10    In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence
F35 1590  9    of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count, and
F35 1600  8    created a sayin' which has survived through the years.
F35 1610  4    "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after examinin'
F35 1620  2    the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation
F35 1630  1    for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed
F35 1630  9    to own, then rode out and tried to find it.
F35 1640  9       When a cowhand said that a man had "good cow sense",
F35 1650  6    he meant to pay 'im a high compliment. No matter by
F35 1660  4    what name cattle were called, there was no denyin'
F35 1660 13    that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin,
F35 1670  9    but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast
F35 1680  6    territories of the Northwest.
F35 1690  1    #@ 21 @ SWINGIN' A WIDE LOOP#
F35 1690  7    THE first use of the word "rustler" was as a synonym
F35 1700  6    for "hustler", becomin' an established term for any
F35 1710  4    person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in any
F35 1720  2    enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the
F35 1720 12    hoss wrangler, and when the order was given to go out
F35 1730 10    and "rustle the hosses", it meant for 'im to go out
F35 1740  8    and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin' the hosses was
F35 1750  4    spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was
F35 1760  1    called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost
F35 1760 10    exclusively applied to a cow thief, startin' from the
F35 1770  9    days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their
F35 1780  7    employers to "get out and rustle a few mavericks".
