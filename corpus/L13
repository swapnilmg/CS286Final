L13 0010  1       His son watched until he got as far as the hall,
L13 0010 12    almost out of sight, then hurried after. "Dad. Dad,
L13 0020  7    wait".
L13 0020  8       He caught up with the old man in the living room.
L13 0030 10    Old man Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the
L13 0040  6    front door.
L13 0040  8       "Just this one favor, Dad. Just don't tell Ferguson
L13 0050  6    that crazy opinion of yours".
L13 0070  1       "Why not"? The old man gave the room a stare in
L13 0070 12    leaving; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes
L13 0080  8    burned with a bitter memory. "It's the truth".
L13 0090  4       "The Bartlett girl was killed by Mr. Dronk's son.
L13 0100  4    Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street, talking
L13 0110  2    to the kid. They've found some sort of new evidence,
L13 0110 12    a bundle of clothes or something, and it must link
L13 0120  9    the kid even stronger to the crime. Why won't you accept
L13 0130  8    facts? The two kids were together a lot, they were
L13 0140  5    having some kind of teen-age affair- God knows how
L13 0150  2    far that had gone- and the kid's crippled. He limps,
L13 0150 12    and the man who hit you and took the cane, he limped.
L13 0160 11    My God, how much more do you want"?
L13 0170  5       His father looked him over closely. "You sound like
L13 0180  3    an old woman. You should have gone to work today, 'stead
L13 0190  1    of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house".
L13 0190  9       "Now, see here"-
L13 0200  3       "The trouble with you", old man Arthur began, and
L13 0210  3    then checked himself. Young Mrs. Arthur had opened
L13 0210 11    the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits.
L13 0220 11    The old man opened the door and stepped out into the
L13 0230  8    sunlight. "Isn't enough time to go into it", he finished,
L13 0240  7    and slammed the door in his son's face.
L13 0250  1    ##
L13 0250  2    Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies. "They
L13 0260  1    found something else up there", she said half-aloud
L13 0260 10    to the empty room. "They took it away, overalls or
L13 0270  7    something". She walked restlessly across the room,
L13 0280  4    then back to the windows. "Now they've gone, they didn't
L13 0290  3    come back, and they didn't arrest that Dronk boy".
L13 0300  1    She stood frowning and chewing her lip. She was wearing
L13 0300 11    a brown cotton dress, cut across the hips in a way
L13 0310  9    that was supposed to make her look slimmer, a yoke
L13 0320  5    set into the skirt and flaring pleats below. She smoothed
L13 0330  2    the skirt, sat down, then stood up and went back to
L13 0330 13    the windows. "Why on earth did I send him off to work?
L13 0340 11    There was excuse enough to keep him home ... that young
L13 0350  9    Mr. Arthur's still over there".
L13 0360  2       With sudden energy, she went to the phone and rang
L13 0370  1    Holden's office and asked for him.
L13 0370  7       "I think you had better come home".
L13 0380  3       "Mae, we're so busy. Mr. Crosson's been on everybody's
L13 0390  4    neck, an order he expected didn't come through and
L13 0400  2    he's"-
L13 0400  3       "I don't care. I want you here. I'm all alone and
L13 0410  4    certain things are going on that look very ominous.
L13 0410 13    I need someone to go out and find out what's happening".
L13 0420 11       "But I couldn't do that, even if I were home"! His
L13 0430 11    voice grew high and trembling. "I can't be underfoot
L13 0440  8    every time those cops turn around! They'll ... they'll
L13 0450  5    think I did something".
L13 0460  1       He couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the
L13 0460 11    teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's.
L13 0470  9    "You'll just have to risk it. You can't wander along
L13 0480  8    in the dark, can you? I'd think that you ... even more
L13 0490  7    than I ... would be wondering what they're up to. They
L13 0500  4    found some clothes", she tossed in.
L13 0500 10       "What"?
L13 0510  1       Deliberately, she ignored the yelp. "Also, that
L13 0510  8    Mr. Ferguson was here. I guess he wants to ask you
L13 0520 11    some questions. I stalled him off. He doesn't expect
L13 0530  8    you until five".
L13 0530 11       "Then I'd better wait until five".
L13 0540  6       "No ... o ... o. Come home right away". She slapped
L13 0550  6    the receiver into its holder and stepped away. Her
L13 0560  3    eyes were bright with anticipation.
L13 0560  8       In his office, Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly.
L13 0570  7    He rose from his chair. He had to cough then; he went
L13 0580  8    to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze
L13 0590  4    on his face. He got his hat out of the closet. For
L13 0600  1    a moment he thought of going into Crosson's office
L13 0600 10    to explain that he had to leave, but there was now
L13 0610  9    such a pain in his chest, such a pounding in his head,
L13 0620  5    that he decided to let it go. He passed the receptionist
L13 0630  1    in the outer office, muttering, "I've got to go out
L13 0630 11    for a little while". Let her call Crosson if she wanted
L13 0640 11    to, let Crosson raise the roof or even can him, he
L13 0650  9    didn't care.
L13 0650 11       He got into the car. Putting the key into the switch,
L13 0660  9    pressing the accelerator with his foot, putting the
L13 0670  6    car into reverse, seemed vast endeavors almost beyond
L13 0680  2    the ability of his shaking body. Once out in the street,
L13 0690  1    the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered
L13 0690 11    stricken. When he turned into the highway that led
L13 0700  7    to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home,
L13 0710  4    he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few
L13 0720  1    minutes, sucking in air and squinting and blinking
L13 0720  9    his eyes to clear them of tears.
L13 0730  4       What on earth was in Mae's mind, that she wanted
L13 0740  1    him up there spying on what the cops were doing? What
L13 0740 12    did she think he could do?
L13 0750  5       He tried to ignore what his own common sense told
L13 0760  2    him, but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant.
L13 0770  1    She wanted him to get into trouble. She wanted the
L13 0770 11    police to notice him, suspect him. She was going to
L13 0780  8    keep on scheming, poking, prodding, suggesting, and
L13 0790  3    dictating until the cops got up enough interest in
L13 0800  1    him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions.
L13 0800 12    And he knew in that moment, with a cold sinking of
L13 0810  9    despair, a dying of old hopes, that Mae had spread
L13 0820  5    some kind of word there among the neighbors. Nothing
L13 0830  2    bald, open; but enough. They'd have some suspicions
L13 0830 10    to repeat to the police.
L13 0840  4       Though his inner thoughts cringed at it, he forced
L13 0850  3    himself to think back, recreating the scene in which
L13 0850 12    Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child.
L13 0860  8       It hadn't amounted to anything. There had been nothing
L13 0870  7    evil or dirty in his intentions.
L13 0880  1       A second scene flashed before his mind, the interior
L13 0880 10    of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett
L13 0890 11    girl turning startled to meet him, the dim dark and
L13 0900  8    the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness
L13 0910  3    as Mae had clicked on the light.
L13 0910 10       Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that?
L13 0920  7       Well, it hadn't been what it seemed, he'd had no
L13 0930  7    idea the girl was in there. He hadn't touched her.
L13 0940  3       And when he came to examine the scene, there was
L13 0950  1    a certain staginess to it, it had the smell of planning,
L13 0950 12    and a swift suspicion darted into his mind.
L13 0960  6       Too monstrous, of course. Mae wouldn't have plotted
L13 0970  4    a thing like that. It was just that little accidents
L13 0980  2    played into her hands. Like this murder.
L13 0980  9       He leaned on the wheel, clutching it, staring into
L13 0990  8    the sunlight, and tried to bring order into his thoughts.
L13 1000  5    He felt light-headed and sick. There was no use wandering
L13 1010  4    off into a territory of utter nightmare. Mae was his
L13 1020  1    wife. She was married to him for better or for worse.
L13 1020 12    She wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction.
L13 1030  6       But she was. She was.
L13 1040  1       Even as the conviction of truth roared through him,
L13 1040 10    shattering his last hope of safety, he was reaching
L13 1050  9    to release the hand brake, to head up the road for
L13 1060  7    home, doing her bidding. He drove, and the road wobbled,
L13 1070  3    familiar scenes crept past on either side. He came
L13 1070 12    to a stretch of old orange groves, the trees dead,
L13 1080  9    some of them uprooted, and then there was an outlying
L13 1090  7    shopping area, and tract houses. He had the feeling
L13 1100  3    that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere
L13 1100 13    to hide. But he couldn't imagine where. There was really
L13 1110 10    no place to go, finally, except home to Mae.
L13 1120  7       At the gate he slowed, looking around. Cooper was
L13 1130  4    beside his car, on the curb at the right, just standing
L13 1140  2    there morosely; he didn't even look up. Behind him
L13 1140 11    on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur;
L13 1150 10    he was straight, something angry in his attitude, as
L13 1160  7    if he might be waiting to report something. Holden
L13 1170  3    stepped on the gas.
L13 1170  7       A new idea drifted in from nowhere. He could go
L13 1180  5    to the police. He could tell them his fears of being
L13 1190  3    involved, he could explain what had happened in the
L13 1190 12    old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and
L13 1200  7    how she had held it over him- the scene was complete
L13 1210  7    in his mind at the moment, even to his own jerkings
L13 1220  1    and snivelings, and Ferguson's silent patience. He
L13 1220  8    could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department.
L13 1230  9       It wasn't what Mae would want him to do, though.
L13 1240  9    He was sure of this. Once he had abandoned himself
L13 1250  5    to the very worst, once he had quieted all the dragons
L13 1260  3    of worry and suspense, there wouldn't be very much
L13 1260 12    for Mae to do. At that moment, Holden almost slammed
L13 1270 10    on the brakes to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson
L13 1280  8    was about.
L13 1280 10       It would be such a relief.
L13 1290  4       What was that old sign, supposed to be painted over
L13 1300  2    a door somewhere, Abandon hope, all ye who enter here?
L13 1300 12       Why, Holden said to himself, surprised at his own
L13 1310 10    sudden insight, I'll bet some of those people who enter
L13 1320  9    are just as happy as can be. They've worried, they've
L13 1330  5    lain awake nights, they've shook at the slightest footstep,
L13 1340  5    they've pictured their own destruction, and now it's
L13 1350  3    all over and they can give up. Sure, they're giving
L13 1350 13    up hope. Hand in hand with hope went things like terror
L13 1360 11    and apprehension. Good-bye. Holden waved a hand at
L13 1370  8    the empty street. Glad to see you go.
L13 1380  4       He drove into the paved space before the garage
L13 1390  1    and got out, slamming the car door. He looked up and
L13 1390 12    down the street. If Ferguson's car had been in sight,
L13 1400  8    Holden would have walked directly to it.
L13 1410  4       He went to the front door and opened it and looked
L13 1420  1    in.
L13 1420  2       Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen.
L13 1430  1    She had a cup of something steaming, coffee perhaps,
L13 1430 10    in one hand, a fresh piece of toast in the other. She
L13 1440  9    stood there, watching Holden come in, and she put the
L13 1450  7    piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner
L13 1460  1    with a huge chomp of her white teeth.
L13 1460  9       "Mae"-
L13 1470  1       "I've been thinking", she said, swallowing the toast.
L13 1470  9    "Didn't you have an old pair of painting overalls in
L13 1480 10    the garage? You used them that time you painted the
L13 1490  8    porch at our other house. And then you wiped up some
L13 1500  5    grease".
L13 1500  6       She had caught him off guard, no preparation, nothing
L13 1510  4    certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster. "No.
L13 1520  2    Wait a minute. What do you"-
L13 1520  8       "I've been looking for them, and they're gone. I'm
L13 1530  8    sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days
L13 1540  7    ago. Or even yesterday. You used to paint in them,
L13 1550  3    and then you just took them for rags. The police have
L13 1550 14    them now".
L13 1560  2       "I don't remember any overalls at all".
L13 1570  1       "They were all faded. Worn through at the knees".
L13 1570 10    She stood sipping and chewing and watching. "Green
L13 1580  6    paint, wasn't it? Well, I'm not sure of the color.
L13 1590  7    But you had them".
L13 1590 11       "Mae, sit down. Put down the cup of coffee. Tell
L13 1600 10    me what this is all about".
L13 1610  1       She shook her head. She took another bite of toast.
L13 1610 11    Holden noticed almost absently how she chewed, how
L13 1620  8    the whole side of her cheek moved, a slab of fat that
L13 1630  8    extended down into her neck. "My goodness, you ought
L13 1640  3    to remember if I do. You're going to have to go to
L13 1650  2    the police and explain what happened. Tell them the
L13 1650 11    truth ... or something ... before they come here".
L13 1660  7       A seeping coldness entered Holden's being; his nerves
L13 1670  5    seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling
L13 1680  4    fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like, liable
L13 1690  1    to break like an icicle at any moment. "I've never
L13 1690 11    owned any painting overalls.
