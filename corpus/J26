J26 0010  1       A royal decree issued in 1910, two years after the
J26 0010 11    Belgian government assumed authority for the administration
J26 0020  6    of the Congo, prescribed the registration of all adult
J26 0030  6    males by chiefdoms. Further decrees along this line
J26 0040  4    were issued in 1916 and 1919. In 1922 a continuous
J26 0050  1    registration of the whole indigenous population was
J26 0050  8    instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General, and
J26 0060  6    the periodic compilation of these records was ordered.
J26 0070  4    But specific procedures for carrying out this plan
J26 0080  2    were left to the discretion of the provincial governors.
J26 0080 11    A unified set of regulations, applicable to all areas,
J26 0090  8    was issued in 1929, and a complementary series of demographic
J26 0100  6    inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same
J26 0110  5    time. The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized
J26 0120  2    in 1933. General responsibility for its administration
J26 0120  9    rested with a division of the colonial government concerned
J26 0130  9    with labor supply and native affairs, Service des Affaires
J26 0140  8    Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre (AIMO, **f Direction,
J26 0150  6    **f Direction Generale, Gouvernement Generale). Tribal
J26 0160  4    authorities, the chiefs and their secretaries, were
J26 0170  3    held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous
J26 0180  2    persons within their territories, under the general
J26 0180  9    supervision of district officials. The district officials,
J26 0190  7    along with their other duties, were obliged to organize
J26 0200  7    special demographic inquiries in selected areas and
J26 0210  4    to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic
J26 0220  1    statistics.
J26 0220  2       The regulations require the inscription of each
J26 0230  1    individual (male or female, adult or child) on a separate
J26 0230 11    card (fiche). The cards, filed by circonscription (sub-chiefdom,
J26 0240  8    or village), are kept in the headquarters of each territoire
J26 0250  9    (chiefdom). Each card is expected to show certain information
J26 0260  8    about the individual concerned, including his or her
J26 0270  6    date of birth (or age at a specified time), spouses,
J26 0280  3    and children. Additional entries must be made from
J26 0280 11    time to time. Different cards are used for males and
J26 0290 10    females, and a corner is clipped from the cards of
J26 0300  7    adults, and of children when they reach puberty. So
J26 0310  3    a quick count could be made at any time, even by an
J26 0310 15    illiterate clerk, of the number of registered persons
J26 0320  8    in four age-and-sex classes. Personal identification
J26 0330  4    cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments,
J26 0340  5    inoculations, periods of employment, and changes of
J26 0350  2    residence are recorded. Similar identification cards
J26 0350  8    were issued in 1959 to all adult females. Each adult
J26 0360  9    is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription
J26 0370  5    and obtaining an identification card which must be
J26 0380  4    shown on demand. The registration card of a person
J26 0380 13    leaving his home territory for a short period is put
J26 0390 10    into a special file for absent persons. The cards of
J26 0400  7    permanent out-migrants are, in theory, sent to an office
J26 0410  5    in the place of new residence. Finally, the registration
J26 0420  1    of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made
J26 0420 10    compulsory in most regions.
J26 0430  4       Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex
J26 0440  1    classes were counted each year. In addition, demographic
J26 0440  9    inquiries, supposedly involving field investigations,
J26 0450  5    were conducted in selected minor divisions (circonscriptions)
J26 0460  4    containing about 3 percent of the total population.
J26 0470  5    The results of these inquiries were used to adjust
J26 0480  2    compilations of data from the registers and to provide
J26 0480 11    various ratios and rates by districts, including birth
J26 0490  8    and death rates, general fertility rates, distributions
J26 0500  4    by marital status, fertility of wives separately in
J26 0510  3    polygynous and non-polygynous households, infant mortality,
J26 0520  1    and migration. The areas to be examined in these inquiries
J26 0520 11    were selected by local officials, supposedly as representative
J26 0530  8    of a larger population. Averages of the ratios obtained
J26 0540  7    in a few selected areas were applied to the larger
J26 0550  6    population.
J26 0550  7       The scheme, in theory, is an ingenious adaptation
J26 0560  5    of European registration systems to the conditions
J26 0570  1    of African life. But it places a severe strain on the
J26 0570 12    administrative resources (already burdened in other
J26 0580  6    ways) of a widely dispersed, poor and largely illiterate
J26 0590  5    population. The sampling program was instituted before
J26 0600  3    the principles of probability sampling were widely
J26 0610  1    recognized in population studies. The system was not
J26 0610  9    well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers.
J26 0620  7    The distinction between domiciled (de jure) and present
J26 0630  5    (de facto) population was not clearly defined. So the
J26 0640  4    results are subject to considerable confusion. The
J26 0650  1    system tended to break down during the war, but was
J26 0650 11    reactivated; it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency
J26 0660  9    by 1951. In spite of the defects in this system, the
J26 0670  6    figures on total population during the late 1930's
J26 0680  2    and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented
J26 0680 12    actual conditions in most districts with approximate
J26 0690  7    fidelity. But the information on the dynamics of population
J26 0700  7    was often quite misleading.
J26 0710  1       The same system, with minor modifications, was developed
J26 0710  9    in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration. Here
J26 0720  5    again it seems that useful approximations of the size
J26 0730  6    and geographical distribution of the population were
J26 0740  3    obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early
J26 0740 14    post-war periods.
J26 0750  2       Before considering more recent activities, we should
J26 0760  2    note another important aspect of demography in Belgian
J26 0760 10    Africa. A number of strong independent agencies, established
J26 0770  8    in some cases with governmental or royal support, have
J26 0780  7    conducted large medical, social, educational and research
J26 0790  4    operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.
J26 0800  4    The work of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance
J26 0810  1    Medicale aux Indigenes du Congo Belge (FOREAMI) has
J26 0820  2    special interest with respect to demography. This agency
J26 0820 10    accepted responsibility for medical services to a population
J26 0830  8    ranging from 638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in
J26 0840  8    1956 in the Kwango District and adjacent areas east
J26 0850  5    of Leopoldville. Each year from 1941 on, its medical
J26 0860  2    staff had conducted intensive field investigations
J26 0860  8    to determine changes in population structure and vital
J26 0870  7    rates and, as its primary objective, the incidence
J26 0880  4    of major diseases. Its findings are reported each year
J26 0890  3    in its Rapport sur l'activite pendant annee ... (Bruxelles).
J26 0900  1    Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical
J26 0910  1    officers in other areas. Other independent, or partially
J26 0910  9    independent agencies, have promoted investigations
J26 0920  5    on topics directly or indirectly related to demography.
J26 0930  4    These studies vary widely in scope and precision. L'Institut
J26 0940  2    pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale
J26 0960  1    (IRSAC) has sponsored well-designed field investigations
J26 0960  8    and has cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi
J26 0970  9    in the development of its official statistics.
J26 0980  5       A massive investigation of the characteristics of
J26 0990  5    in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in Ruanda-Urundi
J26 1000  3    is being carried on by J. J. Maquet, former Director
J26 1010  1    of the Social Science branch of IRSAC, now a professor
J26 1020  1    at l'Universite Officielle du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi.
J26 1030  1    Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items (collected
J26 1030  9    by sub-chiefs in 1,100 circumscriptions) have been
J26 1040  6    tabulated. The results are now being analyzed.
J26 1050  4       Statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic
J26 1060  3    importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during
J26 1070  1    the post-war years in connection with long-term economic
J26 1070 11    and social programs. The AIMO organizations of both
J26 1080  6    countries, which maintain administrative services throughout
J26 1090  4    the territories, retained immediate responsibility
J26 1100  2    for the collection and publication of demographic information.
J26 1110  1    However, the statistical offices of both governments
J26 1110  8    were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis
J26 1120  8    of these statistics. A Bureau de la Demographie (A.
J26 1130  7    Romaniuk, Director) was formed under AIMO in the Congo,
J26 1140  6    to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique
J26 1150  3    of the Secretariat General. Eventually responsibility
J26 1160  1    for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred
J26 1160  9    to the demographic division of the Central Statistical
J26 1170  8    Office. The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi
J26 1180  6    was directed by V. Neesen, a member of the IRSAC staff,
J26 1190  7    though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices
J26 1200  5    of AIMO, which has continuing responsibility for demographic
J26 1210  3    statistics in this territory. A member of the IRSAC
J26 1220  2    staff (E. van de Walle) was recently delegated to cooperate
J26 1230  1    with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics
J26 1240  1    in this territory.
J26 1240  4       The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi
J26 1250  1    (1952) and in the Congo (1955-57) were major advances.
J26 1250 11    We will deal first with the program in the Congo though
J26 1260 11    this was put into operation later than the other.
J26 1270  6       The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo
J26 1280  5    was not emphasized in the official announcements. The
J26 1290  2    term enquetes demographiques, previously used for the
J26 1290  9    supplementary investigations carried out in connection
J26 1300  6    with the administrative censuses, was used for the
J26 1310  6    new investigations. However, the differences in procedure
J26 1320  3    are fundamental. These are as follows:
J26 1330  1    _(1) FIELD WORK PROCEDURES:_
J26 1330  4       Field operations were transferred from administrative
J26 1340  2    personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially
J26 1350  1    trained teams of full-time African investigators (three
J26 1360  7    teams, each working in two provinces). These teams
J26 1370  6    carried out the same operations successively in different
J26 1380  4    areas.
J26 1380  5    _(2) NATURE OF THE SAMPLE:_
J26 1380 10       Sample areas in the new investigations were selected
J26 1390  8    strictly by application of the principles of probability
J26 1400  6    theory, so as to be representative of the total population
J26 1410  5    of defined areas within calculable limits. In short,
J26 1420  3    scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective
J26 1430  1    sampling. The populations of the various districts,
J26 1430  8    or other major divisions, were stratified by type of
J26 1440  6    community (rural, urban, mixed) and, where appropriate,
J26 1450  3    by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy. Sample
J26 1460  1    units (villages in rural areas, houses in cities) were
J26 1460 10    drawn systematically within these strata.
J26 1470  4    _(3) SIZE OF THE SAMPLE:_
J26 1470  9       Different sampling ratios were applied under different
J26 1480  7    conditions. Higher proportions were sampled in urban
J26 1490  6    and mixed communities than in rural areas. About 11
J26 1500  4    percent of the total population was covered in the
J26 1500 13    new investigation, as compared with about 3 percent
J26 1510  8    in the previous inquiries.
J26 1520  1    _(4) QUESTIONS AND DEFINITIONS:_
J26 1520  5       Uniform questions, definitions, and procedures were
J26 1530  4    enforced throughout the whole country. Data were obtained,
J26 1540  3    separately, on three classes of persons: (a) residents,
J26 1550  1    present; (b) residents, absent; and (c) visitors. In
J26 1550  9    the reports, summary results are given for both the
J26 1560  9    de facto (a and c) and de jure (a and b) populations;
J26 1570  8    but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported
J26 1580  5    only for the de jure population (or, in some districts,
J26 1590  4    only the de facto population).
J26 1590  9       These changes represent in effect, a shift from
J26 1600  8    (1) an administrative compilation of data obtained
J26 1610  4    through procedures designed primarily to serve political
J26 1620  2    and economic objectives to (2) a systematic sampling
J26 1620 10    census of the whole African population.
J26 1630  6       The population registration system still has important
J26 1640  5    functions. It supplies local data which are useful
J26 1650  2    in administration and which can be used as a basis
J26 1650 12    for intensive studies in particular situations. It
J26 1660  6    provides a frame for the sampling census. It also provides
J26 1670  5    a frame within which the registration of vital events
J26 1680  4    is gradually gaining force (though one cannot expect
J26 1680 12    to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of
J26 1690  9    the Congo from this source in the near future). It
J26 1700  7    is still used in making current population estimates
J26 1710  2    in post-census years, though the value of these estimates
J26 1720  1    is open to question. Finally, it may have certain very
J26 1720 11    important, less obvious values. Even though the registers
J26 1730  8    may have an incomplete record of persons present in
J26 1740  6    a particular area or include persons no longer living
J26 1750  4    there, they contain precise information on ages, by
J26 1750 12    date of birth, for some of the persons present (especially
J26 1760 10    children in relatively stable communities) and supplementary
J26 1770  6    information (such as records of marital status) for
J26 1780  6    many others. The quality of the census data can, therefore,
J26 1790  4    be greatly improved by the use of the registration
J26 1800  1    records in conjunction with the field inquiries. Furthermore,
J26 1800  9    it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias
J26 1810 10    in method (as distinguished from sampling error) in
J26 1820  5    each of these sources, on such subjects as fertility,
J26 1830  3    mortality, and migration during a given interval by
J26 1830 11    using information from two largely independent sources
J26 1840  7    in conjunction.
J26 1850  1       The first sampling census in the Congo extended
J26 1850  9    over a three-year period, 1955-57; the results were
J26 1860  7    still being processed in 1959. It is planned to double
J26 1870  6    the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment
J26 1880  2    in a second demographic inquiry in 1960, so that the
J26 1880 12    inquiry can be carried through in one year and the
J26 1890 10    results published more expeditiously. It is proposed
J26 1900  5    that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried
J26 1910  3    out at five-year intervals.
J26 1910  8       Reports already issued on the sampling census, 1955-57,
J26 1920  8    in various areas run as follows (using only the French
J26 1930  5    and omitting corresponding Flemish titles): @.
J26 1940  2       This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.
J26 1950  1       Other reports in identical form, but with somewhat
J26 1950  9    varying content, have been issued for: @.
J26 1960  6       These area reports will be followed, according to
J26 1970  4    present plans, by a summary report, which will include
J26 1980  2    a detailed statement on methods.
