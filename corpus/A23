A23 0010  1    _SALEM (SPECIAL)_
A23 0010  3       - For a second month in a row, Multnomah County
A23 0020  1    may be short of general assistance money in its budget
A23 0020 11    to handle an unusually high summer month's need, the
A23 0030  7    state public welfare commission was told Friday.
A23 0040  4       It is the only county in the state so far this month
A23 0050  4    reporting a possible shortage in GA category, for
A23 0060  1    which emergency allotment can be given by the state
A23 0060 10    if necessary.
A23 0070  1       William Smythe, director of field service, told
A23 0070  8    the commissioners that Multnomah, as of Aug. 22, had
A23 0080  8    spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category,
A23 0090  5    leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.
A23 0100  1       At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks
A23 0100 11    of the month, this could mean a shortage of as high
A23 0110 10    as $17,000. But it probably will be less because of
A23 0120  6    a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month,
A23 0130  3    Smythe said. No request for emergency allotment had
A23 0130 11    yet been received, however.
A23 0140  4    #BOARD OKS PACT#
A23 0140  7    The commission, meeting for the first time with both
A23 0150  7    of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy Webster,
A23 0160  2    of Hood River, and Dr. Ennis Keizer, of North Bend,
A23 0170  1    approved a year's contract for a consultant in the
A23 0170 10    data processing department who has been the center
A23 0180  7    of considerable controversy in the past.
A23 0190  3       The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting
A23 0200  1    the agencies electronic data processing program to
A23 0200  8    magnetic tape, would renew his present salary of $8
A23 0210  7    an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month.
A23 0220  3       Field does the planning for the machine operations
A23 0230  1    and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing
A23 0230 11    system to new programs as they are made necessary by
A23 0240  9    legislative and policy changes.
A23 0250  1       Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because
A23 0260  1    of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program,
A23 0260 10    the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he
A23 0270  9    was not continued for a period.
A23 0280  3       But he emphasized that the agency must train people
A23 0290  1    within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles,
A23 0290 10    and he said he personally "regrets very much that the
A23 0300  6    agency has not done this in the past".
A23 0310  2       He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency
A23 0320  1    was literally dependent now on the machine processing,
A23 0320  9    "and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it
A23 0330  9    broke down or the three or four persons directing it
A23 0340  4    were to leave".
A23 0340  7    #SALARY TERMED MODEST#
A23 0340 10    Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant
A23 0350 10    basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator
A23 0360  8    of the agency and not to other agencies of the government.
A23 0370  7    He also said that the salary, in terms of going rates
A23 0380  5    in the field, was "modest" in terms of the man's responsibility.
A23 0390  2    The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed,
A23 0400  1    he said, and added Field's long service in state government
A23 0410  1    and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare
A23 0410 10    program.
A23 0420  1       "Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative
A23 0420 12    session and defend this contract"? asked Mrs. Grace
A23 0430  7    O. Peck, representative from Multnomah County, of the
A23 0440  6    commission chairman, Joseph E. Harvey Jr.
A23 0450  3       "My feeling at the moment", he said, "is that we
A23 0460  4    have no alternative, irrespective of some of the arguments
A23 0470  1    about him. The continued operation of this program
A23 0470  9    depends on having his service".
A23 0480  3    #HARVEY CRITICIZED#
A23 0480  5    Mrs. Peck, later joined by the commission's vice-chairman,
A23 0490  6    Mrs. Lee Patterson, took Harvey to task for comments
A23 0500  5    he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday.
A23 0510  3       A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service,
A23 0520  2    of which Harvey is president, quoted him as saying
A23 0520 11    the welfare office move to Salem, instead of "crippling"
A23 0530  8    the agency, had provided an avenue to correct administrative
A23 0540  8    weaknesses, with the key being improved communications
A23 0550  5    between F+A and the commission staff.
A23 0560  2       "I rather resent", she said, "you speaking to those
A23 0570  2    groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished
A23 0570 11    this. ... I think you fell short of the real truth
A23 0580 11    in the matter: That the move is working out through
A23 0590  6    the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people.
A23 0600  3    ... The staff deserves a lot of credit working down
A23 0610  2    here under real obstacles".
A23 0610  6       Harvey said his objective was to create a better
A23 0620  6    public image for welfare".
A23 0630  1       The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G. Huntley
A23 0630 10    was arrested in Phoenix, Ariz., last week and will
A23 0640  9    be returned to Portland to face charges of assault
A23 0650  6    and robbery, Portland detectives said Friday.
A23 0660  2       Mrs. Lavaughn Huntley is accused of driving the
A23 0670  1    getaway car used in a robbery of the Woodyard Bros.'
A23 0670 11    Grocery, 2825 E. Burnside St., in April of 1959.
A23 0680  9       Her husband, who was sentenced to 15 years in the
A23 0690  9    federal prison at McNeil Island last April for robbery
A23 0700  5    of the Hillsdale branch of Multnomah Bank, also was
A23 0710  3    charged with the store holdup. Secret Grand Jury indictments
A23 0720  1    were returned against the pair last week, Detective
A23 0720  9    Murray Logan reported.
A23 0730  2       The Phoenix arrest culminates more than a year's
A23 0740  1    investigation by Detective William Taylor and other
A23 0740  8    officers. Taylor said Mrs. Huntley and her husband
A23 0750  7    also will be questioned about a series of 15 Portland
A23 0760  6    robberies in spring of 1959 in which the holdup men
A23 0770  3    bound their victims with tape before fleeing.
A23 0770 10       Mrs. Huntley was held on $20,000 bond in Phoenix.
A23 0780  9    She was arrested by Phoenix Police after they received
A23 0790  6    the indictment papers from Portland detectives.
