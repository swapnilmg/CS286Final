R06 0010  1       I CALLED the other afternoon on my old friend, Graves
R06 0010 11    Moreland, the Anglo-American literary critic- his mother
R06 0020  8    was born in Ohio- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage
R06 0030  9    on the Upson Downs, raising hell and peacocks, the
R06 0040  6    former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an
R06 0050  3    angry old man about the state of literature or something
R06 0060  1    else that is dwindling and diminishing, such as human
R06 0060 10    stature, hope, and humor.
R06 0070  3       My unscientific friend does not believe that human
R06 0080  1    stature is measurable in terms of speed, momentum,
R06 0080  9    weightlessness, or distance from earth, but is a matter
R06 0090  8    of the development of the human mind. After Gagarin
R06 0100  4    became the Greatest Man in the World, for a nation
R06 0110  2    that does not believe in the cult of personality or
R06 0110 12    in careerism, Moreland wrote me a letter in which he
R06 0120  9    said: "I am not interested in how long a bee can live
R06 0130  8    in a vacuum, or how far it can fly. A bee's place is
R06 0140  4    in the hive".
R06 0140  7       "I have come to talk with you about the future of
R06 0150  6    humor and comedy", I told him, at which he started
R06 0160  2    slightly, and then made us each a stiff drink, with
R06 0160 12    a trembling hand.
R06 0170  2       "I seem to remember", he said, "that in an interview
R06 0180  1    ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years
R06 0180 11    to live. Did you go to their funeral"?
R06 0190  6       "I was wrong", I admitted. "Comedy didn't die, it
R06 0200  5    just went crazy. It has identified itself with the
R06 0210  3    very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate.
R06 0210 14    We now have not only what has been called over here
R06 0220 11    the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes,
R06 0230  7    magazines known as Horror Comics, and sick comedians.
R06 0240  4    There are even publications called Sick and Mad. The
R06 0250  3    Zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March
R06 0260  1    hare; it is manic as a man".
R06 0260  8       "I woke up this morning", Moreland said, "paraphrasing
R06 0270  4    Lewis Carroll. Do you want to hear the paraphrase"?
R06 0280  3       "Can I bear it"? I asked, taking a final gulp of
R06 0290  5    my drink, and handing him the empty glass.
R06 0300  1       "Just barely", he said, and repeated his paraphrase:
R06 0300  9    "The time has come", the walrus said, "To speak of
R06 0310 10    manic things, Of shots and shouts, and sealing dooms
R06 0320  8    Of commoners and kings".
R06 0330  1       Moreland fixed us each another drink, and said,
R06 0330  9    "For God's sake, tell me something truly amusing".
R06 0340  8       "I'll try", I said, and sat for a moment thinking.
R06 0350 10    "Oh yes, the other day I reread some of Emerson's English
R06 0360  8    Traits, and there was an anecdote about a group of
R06 0370  8    English and Americans visiting Germany, more than a
R06 0380  4    hundred years ago. In the railway station at Berlin,
R06 0390  1    a uniformed attendant was chanting, 'Foreigners this
R06 0390  8    way! Foreigners this way'! One woman- she could have
R06 0400  8    been either English or American- went up to him and
R06 0410  8    said, 'But you are the foreigners'". I took a deep
R06 0420  5    breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink, and
R06 0430  3    said, "I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson
R06 0440  1    for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy
R06 0440 11    for music and comedy".
R06 0450  1       "What's the matter with the music"? Moreland asked.
R06 0460  2       "It doesn't drown out the dialogue", I explained.
R06 0470  1       "Let's talk about books", Moreland said. "I am told
R06 0480  1    that in America you have non-books by non-writers,
R06 0480 11    brought out by non-publishers for non-readers. Is it
R06 0490  8    all non-fiction"?
R06 0500  1       "There is non-fiction and non non-fiction", I said.
R06 0500 10    "Speaking of nonism: the other day, in a story about
R06 0510 10    a sit-down demonstration, the Paris Herald Tribune
R06 0520  5    wrote, 'The non-violence became noisier'. And then
R06 0530  3    Eichmann was quoted as saying, in non-English, that
R06 0540  1    Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense".
R06 0550  1       "If we cannot tell evil, horror, and insanity from
R06 0550 10    nonsense, what is the future of humor and comedy"?
R06 0560  7    Moreland asked, grimly.
R06 0570  1       "Cryptic", I said. "They require, for existence,
R06 0570  7    a brave spirit and a high heart, and where do you find
R06 0580 10    these? In our present era of Science and Angst, the
R06 0590  6    heart has been downgraded, to use one of our popular
R06 0600  4    retrogressive verbs".
R06 0600  6       "I know what you mean", Moreland sighed. "Last year
R06 0610  5    your Tennessee Williams told our Dilys Powell, in a
R06 0620  6    television program, that it is the task of the playwright
R06 0630  2    to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart.
R06 0640  1    Like almost everybody else, he confused the heart,
R06 0640  9    both as organ and as symbol, with the disturbed psyche,
R06 0650  7    the deranged glands, and the jumpy central nervous
R06 0660  3    system. I'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up
R06 0670  2    when it beholds a rainbow in the sky, or for the heart
R06 0670 14    that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils.
R06 0680  8    The sentimental pure heart of Galahad is gone with
R06 0690  6    the knightly years, but I still believe in the heart
R06 0700  4    of the George Meredith character that was not made
R06 0700 13    of the stuff that breaks".
R06 0710  4       "We no longer have Tom Moore's and Longfellow's
R06 0720  3    'heart for any fate', either", I said.
R06 0730  1       "Moore and Longfellow didn't have the fate that
R06 0730  9    faces us", Moreland said. "One day our species promises
R06 0740  7    co-existence, and the next day it threatens co-extinction".
R06 0750  6    We sat for a while drinking in silence.
R06 0760  2       "The heart", I said finally, "is now either in the
R06 0770  2    throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes. When
R06 0770 13    it was worn in the breast, or even on the sleeve, we
R06 0780 10    at least knew where it was". There was a long silence.
R06 0790  6       "You have visited England five times in the past
R06 0800  5    quarter-century, I believe", my host said. "What has
R06 0810  2    impressed you most on your present visit"?
R06 0810  9       "I would say depressed, not impressed", I told him.
R06 0820  9    "I should say it is the turning of courts of law into
R06 0830  9    veritable theatres for sex dramas, involving clergymen
R06 0840  3    and parishioners, psychiatrists and patients. It is
R06 0850  3    becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political
R06 0850 13    arenas from the modern theatre".
R06 0860  5       "Do you think we need a new Henry James to re-explore
R06 0870  6    the Anglo-American scene"? he asked. "Or perhaps a
R06 0880  4    new Noe^l Coward"?
R06 0880  7       "But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room
R06 0890  8    disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James
R06 0900  4    and the antic heyday of Coward. I myself hear it said
R06 0910  3    constantly- in drawing-rooms. In them, there is usually
R06 0920  1    a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems,
R06 0920  9    worthy of being explored either in the novel or in
R06 0930  8    the play or in comedy and satire". I stood up and began
R06 0940  6    pacing.
R06 0940  7       "If you are trying to get us out of the brothel,
R06 0950  6    the dustbin, the kitchen sink, and the tawdry living-room,
R06 0960  1    you are probably wasting your time", Moreland told
R06 0960  9    me. "Too many of our writers seem to be interested
R06 0970 10    only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or
R06 0980  7    from under the rock".
R06 0980 11       "Furiouser and furiouser", I said. "I am worried
R06 0990  8    about the current meanings of the word 'funny'. It
R06 1000  7    now means ominous, as when one speaks of a funny sound
R06 1010  5    in the motor; disturbing, as when one says that a friend
R06 1020  3    is acting funny; and frightening, as when a wife tells
R06 1030  1    the police that it is funny, but her husband hasn't
R06 1030 11    been home for two days and nights".
R06 1040  4       Moreland sat brooding for a full minute, during
R06 1050  2    which I made each of us a new drink. He took his glass,
R06 1050 15    clinked it against mine, and said, "Toujours gai, what
R06 1060  9    the hell"! borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel.
R06 1070  8       "Be careful of the word 'gay', for it, too, has
R06 1080  9    undergone a change. It now means, in my country, homosexual",
R06 1090  7    I said. "Oh, I forgot to say that if one is taken to
R06 1100  8    the funny house in the funny wagon, he is removed to
R06 1110  3    a mental institution in an ambulance. Recently, by
R06 1110 11    the way, I received a questionnaire in which I was
R06 1120  9    asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized".
R06 1130  4    ##
R06 1130  5    MY HOST went over and stared out the window at his
R06 1140  6    peacocks; then he turned to me. "Is it true that you
R06 1150  5    believe the other animals are saner than the human
R06 1150 14    species"?
R06 1160  1       "Oh, that is demonstrable", I told him. "Do you
R06 1170  2    remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone
R06 1170 13    with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously?
R06 1180  9    She told the sheep, 'The world is coming to an end'!
R06 1190  8    And the sheep said- all in unison, I have no doubt-
R06 1200  7    'Ba-a-a'! The sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious
R06 1210  6    horse laugh".
R06 1210  8       "That is only partly non-nonsense", he began.
R06 1220  5       "If you saw the drama called Rhinoceros", I said,
R06 1230  4    "think of the effect it would have on an audience of
R06 1240  4    rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning
R06 1250  1    into a rhinoceros. The rhinos would panic, screaming
R06 1250  9    'Help'!- if that can be screamed in their language".
R06 1260 11       "You think the Russians are getting ahead of us
R06 1270  8    in comedy"? Moreland demanded.
R06 1280  1       "Non-God, no", I said. "The political and intellectual
R06 1290  1    Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago, because
R06 1290 10    they fear things they do not understand and cannot
R06 1300  8    manage, such as satire and irony, such as humor and
R06 1310  3    comedy. Nevertheless, like any other human being upon
R06 1320  2    whom the spotlight of the world plays continually,
R06 1320 10    Khrushchev, the anti-personality cultist, has become
R06 1330  7    a comic actor, or thinks he has. In his famous meeting
R06 1340  7    with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe
R06 1350  3    that he was as funny as Ed Wynn. But, like Caesar,
R06 1360  1    he has only one joke, so far as I can find out. It
R06 1360 14    consists in saying, 'That would be sending the goat
R06 1370  7    to look after the cabbage'. Why in the name of his
R06 1380  6    non-God doesn't he vary it a bit"?
R06 1390  1       "Such as"? Moreland asked.
R06 1390  5       "Such as 'sending the cat to guard the mice', or
R06 1400  7    'the falcon to protect the dove', or most terribly
R06 1410  3    sharp of all, 'the human being to save humanity'".
R06 1420  1       "You and I have fallen out of literature into politics",
R06 1430  1    Moreland observed.
R06 1430  3       "What a nasty fall was there"! I said.
R06 1440  2       Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again,
R06 1440 11    and then came back and sat down, restively. "The world
R06 1450  9    that was once foot-loose and fancy-free", he said,
R06 1460  6    "has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free. In our
R06 1470  5    age of Science and Angst it seems to me more brave
R06 1480  2    to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly
R06 1480 13    far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer
R06 1490  8    space".
R06 1490  9       "The human ego being what it is", I put in, "science
R06 1500 10    fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the
R06 1510  6    planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours
R06 1520  3    must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats. It seems
R06 1530  1    to me that the first human being to reach one of these
R06 1530 13    planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great
R06 1540 11    and noble species".
R06 1550  1       "Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again",
R06 1550  9    Moreland protested.
R06 1560  1       "Not in the largest sense of the words", I said.
R06 1570  1    "The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate
R06 1570 10    tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness
R06 1580  9    of its religions, its ideologies, and its virtually
R06 1590  5    everything else. Why do we not realize that no ideology
R06 1600  4    believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something
R06 1610  1    else? Forty years ago an English writer, W. L. George,
R06 1620  1    dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day, and said,
R06 1620 12    as an example, that 'Saint George for Merry England'
R06 1630  7    would not start a spirit half so quickly as 'Strike
R06 1640  8    frog-eating Frenchmen dead'"!
R06 1650  1       "There was also Gott strafe Angleterre", Moreland
R06 1660  1    reminded me, "and Carthago delenda est, or if you will,
R06 1660 11    Deus strafe Carthage. It isn't what the ideologist
R06 1670  8    believes in, but what he hates, that puts the world
R06 1680  9    in jeopardy. This is the force, in our time and in
R06 1690  6    every other time, that urges the paranoiac and the
R06 1700  1    manic-depressive to become head of a state. Complete
R06 1700 10    power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad.
R06 1710  8    There is a bitter satire for a future writer in that".
R06 1720  6       "Great satire has always been clearly written and
R06 1730  3    readily understandable", I said. "But we now find writers
R06 1740  3    obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers,
R06 1750  1    and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and
R06 1750  9    complexity of poetry and non-poetry. I wrote a few
R06 1760  8    years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing
R06 1770  3    is that the reader should be able to get some idea
R06 1770 14    of what the story is about.
