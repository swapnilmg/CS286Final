L21 0010  1    But the police have dropped the case. I want you to
L21 0010 12    go to Pearson City and find out why- first-hand stuff
L21 0020  8    for your modern crime series. Take the same train Diana
L21 0030  6    Beauclerk took and get there at the same time. Go to
L21 0040  4    the same hotel and occupy the same suite- 1105".
L21 0050  1       "Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime"?
L21 0060  1       "Why not? The police have finished with it. Besides,
L21 0060  9    the number of the suite hasn't been published in any
L21 0070  9    newspaper. To the hotel people, you'll just be an innocent
L21 0080  6    tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite".
L21 0090  3       "Still, they may not want to rent it".
L21 0100  1       "That's your headache. Once inside, keep your eyes
L21 0100  9    open"!
L21 0110  1       "For what"! Alec was growing more and more skeptical.
L21 0120  1    "The police will have gone over every square inch of
L21 0120 11    the place with a fine-tooth comb. The hotel people
L21 0130  9    will have scoured and vacuumed it. Ten to one, it's
L21 0140  6    even been redecorated"!
L21 0140  9       "There's always a chance they may have overlooked
L21 0150  8    something", returned the chief. "I'm betting on that
L21 0160  7    chance. Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited
L21 0170  5    on Beauclerk. Study the topography of the suite. Soak
L21 0180  3    up local color. Reenact everything Beauclerk did.
L21 0190  1       Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself-
L21 0190 10    between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive".
L21 0200 10       Alec smirked. "Cheerful way to spend an evening"!
L21 0210  8    A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face. "Suppose
L21 0220  8    the murderer should return to the scene of the crime"!
L21 0230  7       The chief's eyes gleamed. He spoke softly. "That
L21 0240  5    is exactly what I'm hoping for. After all, the murderer
L21 0250  3    is still at large. And the key to the suite is still
L21 0260  1    missing".
L21 0260  2    ##
L21 0260  3    On the train Alec refreshed his memory of the Beauclerk
L21 0270  1    case by reading teletype flimsies- spot-news stories
L21 0270  9    about the crime sent out by the Pearson City Star,
L21 0280 10    a member of the Syndicate Press.
L21 0290  2       Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living
L21 0300  1    in New York. Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson
L21 0300 13    City. Daniel Forbes, her divorced husband, lived there.
L21 0310  8    So did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce,
L21 0320  9    Kimball and Stacy.
L21 0330  1       She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight
L21 0330 11    to the Hotel Westmore. She telephoned the junior partner
L21 0340  8    of her law firm, Martin Stacy, and asked him to call
L21 0350  8    at her hotel that evening.
L21 0360  1       At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to
L21 0360 11    pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she
L21 0370  8    remarried. According to Stacy, she told him she was
L21 0380  6    planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes
L21 0390  1    for the lump sum. Stacy replied that it would bankrupt
L21 0390 11    Forbes, who had just sunk all his money in a real estate
L21 0400 12    venture.
L21 0400 13       Stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five
L21 0410 10    p.m. She was in good health and spirits, but still
L21 0420  6    determined to get the money from Forbes. No one saw
L21 0430  4    Stacy leave. No other visitor inquired for her that
L21 0440  1    evening.
L21 0440  2       Next morning she was found dead in her suite with
L21 0440 12    a bullet from a .22-caliber Colt revolver in her brain.
L21 0450 10    According to the medical examiner, she was shot between
L21 0460  7    eleven p.m. and one a.m. Her door was locked and the
L21 0470  7    key was missing. So was the gun.
L21 0480  1       When Alec finished reading he was sure that either
L21 0480 10    Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk. Forbes
L21 0490  6    had motive and Stacy had opportunity. Find a motive
L21 0510  4    for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case
L21 0520  1    would be solved.
L21 0520  4    ##
L21 0520  5    The Hotel Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels
L21 0530  3    in Pearson City, and definitely second-rate. Alec's
L21 0540  1    first impression of the lobby was gloomy, Victorian
L21 0540  9    dignity- black walnut and red plush, a black and white
L21 0550  9    tiled floor, and Persian rugs.
L21 0560  1       He studied the night clerk as a man measures an
L21 0560 11    adversary. "I'd like the room I had the last time".
L21 0570 10       "Certainly, sir". The clerk was young and limp,
L21 0580  8    with a tired smile. "Do you recall the number"?
L21 0590  4       "It was 1105".
L21 0590  7       The clerk's smile congealed. "That suite is taken".
L21 0600  7       Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and
L21 0610  9    room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk.
L21 0620  4    Opposite the number 1105 stood one word: Unoccupied.
L21 0630  1       The clerk's glance followed Alec's. "We have better
L21 0640  2    rooms vacant now", he babbled. "Larger and more comfortable.
L21 0650  1    At the same rate".
L21 0655  1       Alec's face was dark, blunt, and sulky. He always
L21 0660  3    looked impertinent and he could look dangerous. He
L21 0660 11    was looking dangerous now. He raised his voice. "Anything
L21 0670  9    wrong with the plumbing in 1105"?
L21 0680  5       There was a sudden stillness in the lobby. Two women,
L21 0690  4    who had been chattering like parrots, were struck dumb.
L21 0700  2    A man, lighting a match for his cigar, paused until
L21 0700 12    the flame burned his fingers. Even the bellboys on
L21 0710  8    their bench were listening.
L21 0720  1       The clerk's eyes flickered. "Of course not"!
L21 0730  1       "Anybody with a contagious disease been in there"?
L21 0730  9       "No"! The clerk was almost hysterical. "It's just
L21 0740  8    that- well, 1105 is being redecorated".
L21 0750  5       "I don't believe it". Alec leaned on the desk, holding
L21 0760  6    the clerk's eyes with his. "Suppose you tell me the
L21 0770  5    real reason", he drawled. "There might be a story in
L21 0780  2    it".
L21 0780  3       "St-story"?
L21 0780  5       "I'm with the Syndicated Press, Feature Service.
L21 0790  4    Either I get the story- or I get the suite".
L21 0800  3       It was blackmail and the clerk knew it. "There is
L21 0810  2    no story", he piped tremulously. "Front! Show this
L21 0810 10    gentleman to 1105"!
L21 0820  3       The stillness persisted as Alec followed a bellboy
L21 0830  3    across the lobby to the elevator. He could feel eyes
L21 0830 13    on his back. He wished it had not been necessary to
L21 0840 10    announce the number of his suite quite so publicly.
L21 0850  6       The corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted
L21 0860  4    by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet. A thick,
L21 0870  2    crimson carpet muffled every footfall. At the end of
L21 0870 11    the corridor Alec noticed a door marked: Fire Stairs.
L21 0880  8    It was a neat setup for murder.
L21 0890  4       The bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105.
L21 0900  2    The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded
L21 0900 13    beyond the window. A few snowflakes sifted down through
L21 0910  8    that theatrical red glow, languid as falling feathers.
L21 0920  5    Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light.
L21 0930  2       The room looked normal and even commonplace. There
L21 0930 10    was no hint of a violent struggle now. Deal furniture
L21 0940 10    with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it
L21 0950  7    stood in the window of a department store. The blue
L21 0960  4    rug was suspiciously bright and new. It had never been
L21 0970  1    stained with blood. Table covers and towels were clean,
L21 0970 10    ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches. The
L21 0980  8    mirror over the bureau was a blank eye, round and innocent.
L21 0990  7       Alec played the part of an innocent tourist. "Is
L21 1000  3    there anything wrong with this room"?
L21 1010  1       "N-no". The boy dropped his eyes.
L21 1010  8       "Afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your
L21 1020  9    mouth shut"?
L21 1020 11       The boy raised his eyes. "Listen, mister. If you
L21 1030  8    want my advice, pack up and take the next train back
L21 1040  7    to New York".
L21 1040 10       "Were you on duty here two weeks ago"?
L21 1050  6       The boy hesitated. Then, "I'm not talking. But I
L21 1060  5    wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks"!
L21 1070  2       He was in a hurry to get out of the room. Alec gave
L21 1080  2    him a tip and let him go.
L21 1080  9       Alone, Alec examined the doors. There were three-
L21 1090  4    one leading to a bathroom, one to the hall, and one
L21 1100  2    to the room next door which was immovable- locked or
L21 1100 12    bolted on the other side. Alec locked the hall door
L21 1110  9    and put the key with his watch on the bedside table.
L21 1120  6    It was just quarter of nine.
L21 1120 12       As he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed
L21 1130 10    a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood
L21 1140  8    beyond the linen cover. Not gray like the dust that
L21 1150  4    collects in an unused room, but white. Women didn't
L21 1160  1    use white face powder nowadays, he recalled. They used
L21 1160 10    pink, tan, or cream powder.
L21 1170  3       Alec glanced into the bathroom. Blood in the bathtub
L21 1180  2    where the murderer appears to have washed his hands.
L21 1190  1    It seemed clean now, but Alec decided against a bath.
L21 1200  9    He crawled into bed and switched off the light.
L21 1210  5       In the darkness he could see the rosy reflection
L21 1220  2    of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window. It
L21 1220 13    winked as steadily as a metronome- on, off- on, off.
L21 1230 10    In less than five minutes Alec was asleep.
L21 1250  4       He never knew just what woke him. Yet suddenly he
L21 1260  3    was wide-awake. There was no sound and apparently no
L21 1260 13    movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation
L21 1270  8    of the red light on the wall.
L21 1280  3       He lay still, listening to the silence, watching
L21 1280 11    the light. Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded
L21 1290 10    twelve solemn notes- midnight. According to the medical
L21 1300  8    examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m.
L21 1310  6    ...
L21 1320  1       Alec heard a faint sound. His heart seemed to swell
L21 1330  6    and knock against the wall of his chest. For the sound
L21 1340  4    was inside the room.
L21 1340  8       he let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily, feigning
L21 1350  5    sleep. The sound was coming nearer. A monstrous shadow
L21 1360  3    fell across the illuminated wall, distorted and indefinable.
L21 1370  1       When the neon sign faded out, the shadow disappeared.
L21 1380  1    When the neon sign flashed on, the shadow was still
L21 1380 11    there. It stretched to an impossible height, climbing
L21 1390  6    the wall to the ceiling. That meant that something
L21 1400  4    between the light and its reflection on the wall was
L21 1410  2    moving closer to the source of the light- in this case,
L21 1410 13    the window.
L21 1420  1       Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles, ready to jump.
L21 1420  9    The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak. The shadow
L21 1430  8    vanished. Someone had moved beyond the range of the
L21 1440  8    light from the window.
L21 1440 12       Abandoning caution, Alec leaped out of bed and groped
L21 1450  9    for the light switch. Before he could snap it on, a
L21 1460  8    stinging blow caught him in the ribs. He lashed out
L21 1470  4    blindly with his right. There was a thick, squashy
L21 1470 13    crack of fist on flesh.
L21 1480  5       Something hard grazed his knuckles. He put everything
L21 1490  3    he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach
L21 1490 14    ought to be. Rough cloth rasped his fist. There was
L21 1500 10    a grunt, curiously inarticulate, like that of an animal
L21 1510  7    in pain. Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped.
L21 1520  6       Alec waited a moment, on guard. Nothing happened.
L21 1530  2    Again he groped for the light switch.
L21 1530  9       The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one
L21 1540 10    corner of the room. On the bare floorboards a man lay
L21 1550  6    face down. He had a short, heavy, powerful body.
L21 1560  2       Alec turned him over and discovered a round, lumpy
L21 1560 11    face with narrow, slanting eyes- a primitive Tartar
L21 1570  8    face from Russia or the Balkans. The man's shoes were
L21 1580  8    too pointed, his overcoat too broad at the shoulders
L21 1590  5    and too narrow at the waist.
L21 1590 11       There was a slight bulge under the left armpit-
L21 1600  8    a shoulder holster. Alec promptly removed the gun.
L21 1610  4    He was familiar with this type. He had seen it in the
L21 1620  3    lineup at Police Headquarters in New York, in Broadway
L21 1620 12    night clubs and Seventh Avenue pool rooms, in the criminal
L21 1630 10    courts. But he was surprised to meet it here. Diana
L21 1640  9    Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld.
L21 1650  4       A professional gunman would not have killed her
L21 1660  2    with a weapon of such small caliber as a .22. Nor would
L21 1660 14    he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing
L21 1670 11    when it would be so much safer to take his victim for
L21 1680  9    a one-way ride on a lonely country road.
L21 1690  2       The man's eyelids fluttered. He opened his eyes.
L21 1690 10       "What are you doing here"? demanded Alec.
L21 1700  8       The man made no reply. His eyes were dazed. His
L21 1710  9    lips were bruised and swollen where Alec had hit him.
L21 1720  6       "Did you kill Diana Beauclerk"?
L21 1730  1       Alec expected an indignant denial, but there was
L21 1730  9    no response at all.
L21 1740  3       "Oh, come on, snap out of it! Or I'll turn you over
L21 1750  3    to the police"! The silence was getting on Alec's nerves.
L21 1760  2       The man opened his mouth, but no words came. Only
L21 1760 12    that curious, animal grunting Alec had heard during
L21 1770  8    their fight.
L21 1780  1       "Don't you speak English"?
L21 1780  5       The man opened his mouth wider. A forefinger pointed
L21 1790  5    toward his gullet. Alec leaned forward to look. There
L21 1800  3    were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate
L21 1800 12    was mutilated.
