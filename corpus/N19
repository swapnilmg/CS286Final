N19 0010  1    He had better write a postcard to Walter. He opened
N19 0010 11    the myth book again and there (along the margin next
N19 0020  7    to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the
N19 0030  4    creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips) were
N19 0040  2    the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's
N19 0040 11    address. The bars were marked as Walter had marked
N19 0050  9    them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret
N19 0060  7    drawer. The code, which had probably something to do
N19 0070  4    with sex or some other interest, Nicolas was determined
N19 0080  1    to find out and put to use. A card to Walter would
N19 0080 13    get him an introduction to this Meredith, and that
N19 0090  6    might be good for something. Nicolas called on his
N19 0100  4    muse, a line came back:
N19 0100  9       "Squaresville, man, and all the palazzos are crummy
N19 0110  8    Palasts".
N19 0110  9       That ought to draw a laugh, Nicolas reasoned, as
N19 0130  8    he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his
N19 0140  6    mind.
N19 0140  7       And indeed, his postcard did draw from Walter a
N19 0150  4    letter recommending his friend, the poet Nicolas Manas,
N19 0160  1    to his friend Meredith Wilder. Five days later, on
N19 0160 10    receiving it, Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on
N19 0170  7    his writing table. Dammit! he inwardly cried.
N19 0180  3       His hand was large and square and heavily tanned.
N19 0190  1    The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt. His
N19 0190 12    four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months.
N19 0200  9    He had returned to the pension a week ago. Now, he
N19 0210  7    was just in the late poems of Ho^lderlin and therefore
N19 0220  3    had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus
N19 0230  1    next semester's class preparation. He was determined
N19 0230  8    to spend an industrious summer. Well, maybe Manas wouldn't
N19 0240  7    call. Meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a
N19 0250  7    line before him: Sie la^cheln, die Schwarzen Hexen.
N19 0260  4    The menace of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked
N19 0280  4    himself should he translate it, 'How the dark fates
N19 0290  2    laughed'? or, more rhythmically, 'The swarthy witches
N19 0290  9    are laughing'? And he missed the point that the swarthy
N19 0300 10    witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape
N19 0310  9    Nicolas Manas.
N19 0310 11       But Nicolas, too, was being interrupted, that morning.
N19 0320  8       Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around
N19 0330  9    his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him
N19 0340  6    off to sleep; but by a blond girl in a sweater and
N19 0350  4    skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded
N19 0360  1    him. Should she wake him? She didn't have the heart.
N19 0360 11    Her heart, her maternal feeling, in fact her ... her
N19 0370  9    being was too busy expressing itself, as quietly thrilled
N19 0380  5    by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a
N19 0390  3    blanket, in a park like a scene from Poussin. She was
N19 0390 14    just not able to break the spell. (Would she have been
N19 0400 11    able to had she known that the blanket belonged to
N19 0410  7    a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night
N19 0420  5    in one of Walter's marked bars? Nicolas: "Look, Nicolas
N19 0430  3    doesn't go to bed with boys- no sex, see? So if all
N19 0440  3    these beers was to get me in bed, man, you just spent
N19 0440 15    a lot of money". Ballet dancer: Protests, tears, and
N19 0450  8    "take what you want, Nicolas, I am a dancer, you are
N19 0460  9    a poet, it is all beautiful". To this meek conjugation
N19 0470  5    Nicolas had replied, "O.K. I can use this blanket.
N19 0480  4    And when you get off this job tonight, well, you can
N19 0490  2    gimme something to eat". And, as a matter of fact,
N19 0490 12    Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night,
N19 0500 10    when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even
N19 0510  4    in summer are laden with dew. He had always known how
N19 0520  3    to find a bed, and on his own terms. He used the blanket
N19 0530  1    for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone
N19 0530 12    off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their
N19 0540  9    small rooms with their few possessions. Mary Jane Lerner
N19 0550  5    knew none of this.) Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun
N19 0560  5    like a fawn, black hair falling over his eyes. She
N19 0570  1    was telling herself that this might just be her reward
N19 0570 11    at the end of a long meaningful search for truth. This
N19 0580  8    was surely a reunion in art, it was all that poetry
N19 0590  6    promised.
N19 0590  7       That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice
N19 0600  5    had opened her eyes. His advice, his voice saying his
N19 0610  3    poems, the fact that he had not so much as touched
N19 0610 14    her- on the contrary, he had put his head back and
N19 0620 11    she had stroked his hair- this was all new. Her eyes
N19 0630  7    had opened, she had caught a glimpse of a new faith.
N19 0640  5       The next day he was gone.
N19 0640 11       Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman,
N19 0650  8    but she was one of the most determined. Even so, it
N19 0660  5    took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's
N19 0670  3    whereabouts. Packing a small suitcase, informing her
N19 0680  2    husband whom she found in Harry's Bar that she was
N19 0680 12    taking a train to Germany to get away for a while,
N19 0690  9    patting his arm, refusing a drink, getting on the train-
N19 0700  6    all this had only taken her two hours. She had arrived
N19 0710  4    this morning and come straight to the English Gardens.
N19 0720  1    "Dear girl", Walter had finally said, "he writes me
N19 0720 10    that he is sleeping in the English Gardens". "How like
N19 0730  9    him"! Mary Jane had smilingly said. "His address",
N19 0740  7    Walter added, "is that great foundling home, the American
N19 0750  6    Express. And I will greatly appreciate it if you will
N19 0760  6    not tell your husband ...". For the last half hour
N19 0770  3    Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the
N19 0770 13    Gardens and, at last, come upon her knight. His presence
N19 0780 10    there, asleep in the grass, confirmed all that Mary
N19 0790  7    Jane believed it was in his power to teach her: freedom
N19 0800  5    from the tedium of needs such as hotels, the meaning
N19 0810  1    of nature, how to live, simply, with the angels.
N19 0810 10       She set down her suitcase. Should she wake him?
N19 0820  8    No. Smiling, she sat down on the suitcase and waited
N19 0830  6    and watched.
N19 0830  8       The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday.
N19 0840  6    Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against
N19 0850  2    the dashboard of a speeding car. He began sweating.
N19 0850 11    In his dream he cried, "Slow down, for Chrissake"!
N19 0860  9    He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler
N19 0870 10    grass. His nose was tickled. He sneezed. He blew his
N19 0880  6    nose expertly between his fingers. He spit. He half
N19 0890  4    sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and
N19 0890 15    then, more vigorously, between his legs. He belched,
N19 0900  8    he stretched.
N19 0910  1       Mary Jane got up, quietly, and walked away.
N19 0910  9       Twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the
N19 0920  9    Gra^fin's pension, her tears dried, signing a hotel
N19 0930  5    form and asking for a bath.
N19 0930 11       Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small
N19 0940  8    attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and
N19 0950  6    minor cities. She had retreated to this world. The
N19 0960  2    Gra^fin, who was charmed by her, told her, "Your sister
N19 0960 12    who was here two years ago has quite dark hair. Families
N19 0970 11    are very interesting. Nevertheless, there is no bath.
N19 0980  7    But a young American has a bath next to his room and
N19 0990  9    I shall ask him if you might use it this once. And
N19 1000  4    then we shall see ...". (The Gra^fin was partial to
N19 1010  2    the word 'shall'.)
N19 1010  5       Meredith was irritated when the Gra^fin knocked
N19 1020  2    at his door and told him, "She is a great beauty! Shall
N19 1030  2    we allow her not to have a bath? Actually, she is a
N19 1030 14    sad beauty, I believe. You shall see her at dinner".
N19 1040  9    Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running;
N19 1050  8    when it stopped he began busily typing, sitting up
N19 1060  4    in a virtuous way. Before dinner, he shaved for the
N19 1070  2    second time that day. A thing he did not like doing,
N19 1070 13    generally. Singing into the mirror and his interested
N19 1080  8    eyes, he was pleased to note, when he stripped for
N19 1090  5    his own bath, that he still had the best part of his
N19 1100  3    Italian sun tan. He flexed his muscles for several
N19 1100 12    minutes, got into the tub, and then grew self-conscious
N19 1110 10    of splashing as he washed.
N19 1120  1       In the small gallery used as the guests' dining
N19 1120 10    room, Meredith sat down at his place and, as always,
N19 1130  9    began teasing the young waitress. He was asking had
N19 1140  6    it been she who left the love note in his sheets (she
N19 1150  3    also served as maid) when he saw the Gra^fin followed
N19 1160  1    by a stately blond girl approaching his table. It would
N19 1160 11    be literary license calculated to glamorize life to
N19 1170  7    say that he, oh, dropped his napkin, so startled was
N19 1180  4    he by Mary Jane's beauty. Yet he did drop his badinage
N19 1190  3    with the ordinary country girl as much in deference
N19 1190 12    to the Gra^fin as acknowledgement that here, indeed,
N19 1200  7    was something special. Mary Jane had made very little
N19 1210  7    effort. Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green
N19 1220  6    cashmere sweater with, as he soon perceived, no brassiere
N19 1240  1    beneath. Her white blond hair was clean and brushed
N19 1240 10    long straight down to her shoulders. Perhaps her eyes
N19 1250  8    were larger and more of a summer blue for all they
N19 1260  7    had seen and wept that day. She had touched her face,
N19 1270  3    truly a noble and pure face, only with a lip salve
N19 1270 14    which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual.
N19 1280 10    The result was grace and modesty. As she was rather
N19 1290  7    tired this evening, her simple "Thank you for the use
N19 1300  5    of your bath"- when she sat down opposite him- spoken
N19 1310  4    in a low voice, came across with coolnesses of intelligence
N19 1320  1    and control. Meredith began falling in love.
N19 1320  8       Soup: "Only this morning"; veal cutlets: "Oh, I
N19 1330  6    couldn't possibly eat all this"!; wine: "Then you were
N19 1340  6    typing poems this afternoon"?; fruit compote: "If you
N19 1350  5    think I would understand it"; a smile.
N19 1360  3       "What a beautiful room. Like ... as if it were built
N19 1370  2    of books".
N19 1370  4       Having opened the windows onto the terrace, lit
N19 1380  2    the fire, translated the motto, Meredith grinned and
N19 1380 10    took down a little triplet of books bound together
N19 1390  8    in old calfskin. Opening these he brought out a schnapps
N19 1400  6    bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden
N19 1410  2    inside it. "I think the maids tipple in the afternoon".
N19 1420  1       "Those sweet girls? Oh ... you're joking. It tastes
N19 1430  1    a little like poppyseed. What's its name? Steinha^ger
N19 1430  9    ..." She whispered Steinha^ger to herself, several
N19 1440  7    times, memorizing it. "Would you first read the poem
N19 1450  8    aloud to me and then let me read it to myself"? Meredith's
N19 1460  6    voice was always deep, with rough bass notes in it;
N19 1470  5    in reading, on platforms, even in the large auditorium
N19 1480  1    of the Y.M.H.A., Poetry Center nights, his voice was
N19 1490  2    intimate, thoughtful, and a trifle shy. His new poem,
N19 1490 11    a love poem, told of a young husband leading his wife
N19 1500  9    upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house
N19 1510  6    have failed. The husband points the steps out with
N19 1520  3    his flashlight: "Its white stare filling her pale eyes
N19 1530  1    To the blind brim with appetite, Bleaching her hands
N19 1530 10    that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in
N19 1540  9    surprise To let the dishes soak all night," (Mary Jane
N19 1550  5    asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line,
N19 1560  4    or was it the fire?) But he read on. In the bedroom
N19 1570  1    before the husband and wife find their way to the bed,
N19 1570 12    the lights go on: "In dull domestic radiance I watch
N19 1580  8    her staring face, still blind, Start wincing in obedience
N19 1590  6    To dirty waters, counters, pots and pans, Waiting below
N19 1600  5    stairs, in her mind". Mary Jane took the page from
N19 1610  3    him and began reading it, moving her lips with the
N19 1610 13    words. "Oh, it's that myth, about Orpheus and ... What
N19 1620 10    is her name? I can never pronounce it". She repeated
N19 1630  8    "Eurydice". The third time rather urgently. But with
N19 1640  7    her hand poem again. She raised her face and nodded,
N19 1650  5    "It's sweet, and very sad". They discussed the way
N19 1660  3    people never tell each other the things on their minds.
N19 1660 13    They finished the small bottle of Steinha^ger. She
N19 1670  8    confessed she was unhappy, he asked was it her husband?
N19 1680  9    She began to explain, "There was this poet, in Italy
N19 1690  6    ..." He interrupted, "Please don't judge all poets".
N19 1700  4    They smiled.
N19 1700  6       At her door, two or three hours later, Mary Jane
N19 1710  5    whispered, "Everyone is asleep". Kissing her he whispered,
N19 1720  4    several times, "Eurydice". The third time rather urgently.
N19 1730  3    But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment,
N19 1740  1    she closed the door and he went back down the hall
N19 1740 12    and into his bed excited, expectant, and finally faintly
N19 1750  7    grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth.
