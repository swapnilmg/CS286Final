A24 0010  1       About 70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals
A24 0010  8    to the board of tax accessors for a review of their
A24 0020  9    1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the
A24 0030  6    town hall in Centredale.
A24 0030 10       These were the last two days set aside by the board
A24 0040  8    for hearing appeals. Appeals were heard for two days
A24 0050  4    two weeks ago. About 75 persons appeared at that time.
A24 0060  1       Louis H. Grenier, clerk of the board, said that
A24 0060 10    the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time
A24 0070  9    the board is visiting new construction sites in the
A24 0080  5    town for assessment purposes. They also will visit
A24 0090  3    properties on which appeals have been made.
A24 0090 10       Any adjustments which are made, Mr. Grenier said
A24 0100  7    earlier this month, will appear on the balance of the
A24 0110  7    tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers take the
A24 0120  3    option of paying quarterly with the balance due next
A24 0120 12    year.

A24 0260  6       Mr. and Mrs. Stephen M. Kochanek reported the theft

A24 0300  9    French and German coins, valued at $500; four rings,
A24 0310  7    a watch and a set of pearl earrings.

A24 0410  9    connection at Eddy and Elm Streets responsible for
A24 0420  3    dumping raw sewage into the Providence River.
A24 0430  1       The division said it would be impossible to work
A24 0430 10    on the line until then because of the large amount
A24 0440  8    of acid sewage from jewelry plants in the area flowing
A24 0450  5    through the line, heavy vehicle traffic on Eddy Street
A24 0460  2    and tide conditions.

A24 0490  8    Cochran, university vice president and business manager,

A24 0550 11       Thomas Rotelli, head of Rhode Island Incinerator

A24 0570  7    were making collections with both newly hired and regular
A24 0580  6    workers.
A24 0580  7       Sydney Larson, a staff representative for the United
A24 0590  5    Steel Workers, which the firm's 25 workers joined before
A24 0600  4    striking, said the state Labor Relations Board has
A24 0610  2    been asked to set up an election to pick a bargaining
A24 0610 13    agent.
A24 0620  1       A 62-year-old Smithfield man, Lester E. Stone of
A24 0620 11    19 Beverly Circle, was in satisfactory condition last
A24 0630  7    night at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, North Providence,
A24 0640  5    with injuries suffered when a car he was driving struck
A24 0650  6    a utility pole on Woonasquatucket Avenue in North Providence
A24 0660  4    near Stevens Street.
A24 0660  7       Mr. Stone suffered fractured ribs and chest cuts,
A24 0670  6    hospital authorities said. He was taken to the hospital
A24 0680  5    by the North Providence ambulance.
A24 0680 10       Before hitting the pole, Mr. Stone's car brushed
A24 0690  8    against a car driven by Alva W. Vernava, 21, of 23
A24 0700  8    Maple Ave., North Providence, tearing away the rear
A24 0710  5    bumper and denting the left rear fender of the Vernava
A24 0720  3    car, police said. Mr. Vernava was uninjured.
A24 0730  1       The impact with the utility pole caused a brief
A24 0730  9    power failure in the immediate area of the accident.
A24 0740  5    One house was without power for about half an hour,
A24 0750  4    a Narragansett Electric Co. spokesman said. The power
A24 0760  1    was off for about five minutes in houses along Smith

A24 0790  1       The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment
A24 0800  1    of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to
A24 0800 11    the state Supreme Court, it appeared last night.
A24 0810  6       Two members of the Democratic-endorsed majority
A24 0820  2    on the school board said they probably would vote to
A24 0830  2    appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education, which
A24 0830 12    said yesterday that the school committee acted improperly
A24 0840  7    in its appointment of the coordinator, Francis P. Nolan
A24 0850  6    3rd, the Democratic-endorsed committee chairman, could
A24 0860  4    not be reached for comment.
A24 0860  9       In its ruling, the state Board of Education upheld
A24 0870  8    Dr. Michael F. Walsh, state commissioner of education,
A24 0880  5    who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred
A24 0890  5    when it named Maurice F. Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual
A24 0900  4    education without first finding that the school superintendent's
A24 0910  2    candidate was not suitable.
A24 0910  6       Supt. Clarence S. Taylor had recommended Roger I.
A24 0920  7    Vermeersch for the post.

A24 0970  6    construction of Interstate Route 95.
A24 0980  1       The award was made by Judge Fred B. Perkins who
A24 0980 11    heard their petition without a jury by agreement of
A24 0990  8    the parties.
A24 0990 10       The award, without interest, compared with a valuation
A24 1000  7    of $57,500 placed on the property by the property owners'
A24 1010  6    real estate expert, and a valuation of $52,500 placed
A24 1020  4    on it by the state's expert.

A24 1290  3    G. Pratt, yesterday by Governor Notte.

A24 1515  1    _BIRMINGHAM, ALA.- (AP)_
A24 1515  4       - The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge
A24 1530  5    one of the members of the jury that failed to reach
A24 1540  1    a verdict in the "Freedom Rider" bus burning trial
A24 1540 10    four weeks ago.
A24 1550  2       U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint,
A24 1560  1    charged that the juror gave false information when
A24 1560  9    asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection
A24 1570  7    of jury.
A24 1570  9       He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker, 59,
A24 1580  8    a farmer of Hartselle, Ala.
A24 1590  2       Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court
A24 1600  2    in Anniston, Ala., on charges of interfering with interstate
A24 1610  1    transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white
A24 1610  9    mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first
A24 1620  8    of the Freedom Riders. The bus was burned outside Anniston.
A24 1630  4       One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed
A24 1640  5    verdict of acquittal. A mistrial was declared in the
A24 1650  2    case against the other seven when the jury was unable
A24 1650 12    to agree on a verdict.
A24 1660  3       The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge
A24 1670  1    of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.
A24 1670 10       The first incident occurred before the trial got
A24 1680  7    under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury
A24 1690  6    panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts.
A24 1700  2       He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone
A24 1710  1    outside the court had spoken to them about the case.
A24 1710 11    Two members of the panel later told in court about
A24 1720  9    receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous
A24 1730  4    persons expressing interest in the trial. Neither was
A24 1740  2    seated on the jury.
A24 1740  6       Then, when the case went to the jury, the judge
A24 1750  4    excused one of the jurors, saying the juror had told
A24 1750 14    him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel
A24 1760 11    the night before the trial opened. The juror said the
A24 1770  7    masked men had advised him to be lenient. The judge
A24 1780  3    replaced the juror with an alternate.
A24 1780  9       No formal charges have been filed as a result of
A24 1790  9    either of the two reported incidents.
A24 1800  2       At the opening of the trial, the jury panel was
A24 1800 12    questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan
A24 1810 11    connections.
A24 1820  1       One member of the panel- not Mr. Parker- indicated
A24 1830  1    he had been a member of the KKK at one time. He was
A24 1830 14    not seated on the jury.
A24 1840  4       The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a
A24 1850  2    maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment
A24 1850 11    on conviction.
