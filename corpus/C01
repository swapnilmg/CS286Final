C01 0010  1       IT IS NOT NEWS that Nathan Milstein is a wizard
C01 0010 11    of the violin. Certainly not in Orchestra hall where
C01 0020  8    he has played countless recitals, and where Thursday
C01 0030  5    night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago
C01 0040  3    Symphony orchestra, playing the Brahms Concerto with
C01 0050  1    his own slashing, demon-ridden cadenza melting into
C01 0050  9    the high, pale, pure and lovely song with which a violinist
C01 0060  9    unlocks the heart of the music, or forever finds it
C01 0070  5    closed.
C01 0070  6       There was about that song something incandescent,
C01 0080  2    for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat. Not the
C01 0090  2    noblest performance we have heard him play, or the
C01 0090 11    most spacious, or even the most eloquent. Those would
C01 0100  8    be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the
C01 0110  5    soloist can surpass himself. This time the orchestra
C01 0120  2    gave him some superb support fired by response to his
C01 0120 12    own high mood. But he had in Walter Hendl a willing
C01 0130 11    conductor able only up to a point.
C01 0140  5       That is, when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the
C01 0150  3    core of the music, sparks flying, bow shredding, violin
C01 0150 12    singing, glittering and sometimes spitting, Mr. Hendl
C01 0160  7    could go along. But Mr. Hendl does not go straight
C01 0170  7    to any point. He flounders and lets music sprawl. There
C01 0180  5    was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous
C01 0190  2    alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist,
C01 0190 11    orchestra and music to ultimate fusion. So we had some
C01 0200 10    dazzling and memorable Milstein, but not great Brahms.
C01 0210  6       The concert opened with another big romantic score,
C01 0220  5    Schumann's Overture to "Manfred", which suffered fate,
C01 0230  4    this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point
C01 0240  2    to keep it afloat. Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes
C01 0240 11    was a considerably more serious misfortune, for it
C01 0250  8    demands transluscent textures, buoyant rhythms, and
C01 0260  5    astringent wit. It got the kind of scrambled, coarsened
C01 0270  2    performance that can happen to best of orchestras when
C01 0280  1    the man with the baton lacks technique and style.

C01 0290  2    The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production
C01 0300  1    of "Tannhaeuser" staged by Wieland Wagner, who is doing
C01 0300 10    all the operas this time, and conducted by Wolfgang
C01 0310  8    Sawallisch. Sawalisch also conducts "The Flying Dutch",
C01 0320  6    opening July 24. "Parsifal" follows July 25, with Hans
C01 0330  6    Knappertsbusch conducting, and he also conducts "Die
C01 0340  4    Meistersinger", to be presented Aug. 8 and 12. The
C01 0350  3    "Ring" cycles are July 26, 27, 28 and 30, and Aug.
C01 0360  1    21, 22, 23 and 25. Rudolf Kempe conducts. No casts
C01 0360 11    are listed, but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro
C01 0370  8    soprano, Grace Bumbry, will sing Venus in "Tannhaeuser".
C01 0390  1       REMEMBER HOW BY a series of booking absurdities
C01 0390  9    Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet? Remember
C01 0400  7    how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the
C01 0410  5    first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet? Well, now we
C01 0420  4    have two big theaters. But barring a miracle, and don't
C01 0430  2    hold your breath for it, Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov
C01 0440  1    Ballet, which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky
C01 0440 11    and is one of the great companies of the world.
C01 0450 10       Before you let loose a howl saying we announced
C01 0460  7    its coming, not once but several times, indeed we did.
C01 0470  4    The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big
C01 0480  1    theater in McCormick Place, which Sol Hurok, ballet
C01 0480  9    booker extraordinary, considers the finest house of
C01 0490  6    its kind in the country- and of course he doesn't weep
C01 0500  6    at the capacity, either.
C01 0500 10    #@#
C01 0500 11    It was all set. Allied Arts corporation first listed
C01 0510  9    the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10. Later the Hurok
C01 0520  9    office made it Dec. 8 thru 17, a nice, long booking
C01 0530  6    for the full repertory. But if you keep a calendar
C01 0540  1    of events, as we do, you noticed a conflict. Allied
C01 0540 11    Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place
C01 0550  7    Dec. 8 and 9. Something had to give. Not La Dietrich.
C01 0560  7    Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut
C01 0570  7    short its Los Angeles booking, fly here to open Nov.
C01 0580  4    28, and close Dec. 2. Shorter booking, but still a
C01 0590  2    booking. We printed it.
C01 0590  6       A couple of days later a balletomane told me he
C01 0600  4    had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and
C01 0600 12    was told "the newspapers had made a mistake". So I
C01 0610 10    started making some calls of my own. These are the
C01 0620  9    results.
C01 0620 10    #@#
C01 0620 11    The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium,
C01 0630  8    Los Angeles, Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4. Not a chance of opening
C01 0640 10    here Nov. 28- barring that miracle. Then why not the
C01 0650  8    juicy booking Hurok had held for us? Well, Dietrich
C01 0660  5    won't budge from McCormick Place. Then how about the
C01 0670  4    Civic Opera house? Well, Allied Arts has booked Lena
C01 0680  2    Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4.
C01 0680 10       Queried about the impasse, Allied Arts said: "Better
C01 0690  7    cancel the Kirov for the time being. It's all up in
C01 0700  8    the air again".
C01 0700 11       So the Kirov will fly back to Russia, minus a Chicago
C01 0710  9    engagement, a serious loss for dance fans- and for
C01 0720  7    the frustrated bookers, cancellation of one of the
C01 0730  4    richest bookings in the country.
C01 0730  9       Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium?
C01 0740  1       Paintings and drawings by Marie Moore of St. Thomas,

C01 0800  3    Abstractions and semi-abstractions by Everett McNear
C01 0810  1    are being exhibited by the University gallery of Notre
C01 0810 10    Dame until Nov. 5.
C01 0830  1       In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget,
C01 0830 11    the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new
C01 0840  8    Leni Bauer-Ecsy production of "Lucia di Lammermoor"
C01 0850  6    this season, returning the favor next season when San
C01 0860  5    Francisco uses the Dallas "Don Giovanni", designed
C01 0870  2    by Franco Zeffirelli.
C01 0880  1       H E. BATES has scribbled a farce called "Hark, Hark,
C01 0890  1    the Lark"! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible
C01 0900  1    novels of the season.
C01 0900  5       If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans,
C01 0910  2    it is hard to find. Perhaps the lesson we should take
C01 0910 13    from these pages is that the welfare state in England
C01 0920 10    still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.
C01 0930  8       Anyway, a number of them meet here in devastating
C01 0940  6    collisions. One is an imperial London stockbroker called
C01 0950  3    Jerebohm. Another is a wily countryman called Larkin,
C01 0960  1    whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled,
C01 0960  8    I believe, in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates' comedie
C01 0970  8    humaine.
C01 0970  9       What's up now? Well, Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie
C01 0980  9    have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing
C01 0990  8    for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities.
C01 1000  3       They want to own a junior-grade castle, or a manor
C01 1010  4    house, or some modest little place where Shakespeare
C01 1010 12    might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth
C01 1020  9    and all her bearded courtiers.
C01 1030  2       They are willing to settle, however, in anything
C01 1040  1    that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work
C01 1040 11    at. And of course Larkin has just the thing they want.
C01 1050  8    #SPLENDOR BY SORCERY#
C01 1060  1    It's a horror. The name of it is Gore Court, and it
C01 1060 13    is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T.
C01 1070  8    S. Eliot. That's not precisely the way Larkin urges
C01 1080  6    them to look at it, though. He conjures herds of deer,
C01 1100  3    and wild birds crowding the air.
C01 1100  9       He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories
C01 1110  8    of Tudor splendor. The stained-glass windows may have
C01 1120  4    developed unpremeditated patinas, the paneling may
C01 1130  2    be no more durable than the planks in a political platform.
C01 1140  1    The vast, dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using
C01 1140 10    except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand
C01 1150  8    unexpected guests for lunch.
C01 1160  1       Larkin has an answer to all that. The spaciousness
C01 1160 10    of the Tudor cooking areas, for example, will provide
C01 1170  7    needed space for the extra television sets required
C01 1180  4    by modern butlers, cooks and maids. Also, perhaps,
C01 1190  1    table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit
C01 1190 11    and contented.
C01 1200  1       It's a wonder, really, to how much mendacious trouble
C01 1210  1    Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous
C01 1210 10    manse. He doesn't really need the immense sum of money
C01 1220 10    (probably converted from American gold on the London
C01 1230  7    Exchange) he makes them pay.
C01 1240  1       For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with
C01 1240  8    his lot. He has a glorious wife and many children.
C01 1250  7    When he needs money to buy something like, say, the
C01 1260  4    Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch, he takes
C01 1270  2    a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies. One of
C01 1270 13    those capital-gains ventures, in fact, has saddled
C01 1280  6    him with Gore Court. He is willing to sell it just
C01 1290  6    to get it off his hands.
C01 1290 12       And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it.
C01 1300  8    They plan to become county people who know the proper
C01 1310  5    way to terminate a fox's life on earth.
C01 1320  1    #FIRST ONE, THEN THE OTHER#
C01 1320  5    If, in Larkin's eyes, they are nothing but Piccadilly
C01 1330  3    farmers, he has as much to learn about them as they
C01 1340  1    have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.
C01 1340 11       Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads
C01 1350  8    its inevitable havoc. Oneupmanship is practiced by
C01 1360  4    both sides in a total war.
C01 1360 10       First the Larkins are ahead, then the Jerebohms.
C01 1370  8    After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled
C01 1380  5    acres with pheasants, he poaches only what he needs
C01 1390  3    for the nourishment of his family and local callers.
C01 1390 12    One of the local callers, a retired brigadier apparently
C01 1400  9    left over from Kipling's tales of India, does not approve
C01 1410  7    of the way Larkin gets his birds.
C01 1420  3       He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair
C01 1430  1    on the south side of the house with a quart glass of
C01 1430 13    beer for sustenance is entirely sporting. But the brigadier
C01 1440  7    dines on the birds with relish.
C01 1460  1       IT is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome
C01 1460 11    and impressive film yet made from Miguel de Cervantes'
C01 1470  8    "Don Quixote" is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done
C01 1480  7    in wide screen and color, which opened yesterday at
C01 1490  5    the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses.
C01 1500  2       More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious
C01 1510  2    adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant
C01 1520  1    and his squire, Sancho Panza, in seventeenth-century
C01 1520  9    Spain, this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the
C01 1530  5    classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and
C01 1540  4    human exposition of character.
C01 1540  8    #@#
C01 1540  9    Nikolai Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played
C01 1550  8    such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the
C01 1560  5    Terrible, performs the lanky Don Quixote, and does
C01 1570  3    so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility
C01 1580  1    and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.
C01 1580  9       His addle-brained knight-errant, self-appointed
C01 1590  5    to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had
C01 1600  5    already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous
C01 1610  1    code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes
C01 1610 12    no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good,
C01 1620  9    moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics,
C01 1630  6    hypocrites and rogues.
C01 1630  9       Cherkasov does not caricature him, as some actors
C01 1640  8    have been inclined to do. He treats this deep-eyed,
C01 1650  5    bearded, bony crackpot with tangible affection and
C01 1660  2    respect. Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that
C01 1660 11    is studiously slow, he develops a sense of a high tradition
C01 1680 10    shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious
C01 1690  6    world.
C01 1690  7       The complexities of communication have been considerably
C01 1700  6    abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English
C01 1710  3    language that has been excellently dubbed in place
C01 1720  2    of the Russian dialogue. The voices of all the characters,
C01 1720 12    including that of Cherkasov, have richness, roughness
C01 1730  7    or color to conform with the personalities. And the
C01 1740  6    subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed.
C01 1750  3    Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish,
C01 1760  1    there is no violation of artistry or logic here.
C01 1760 10       Splendid, too, is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev,
C01 1770  8    one of Russia's leading comedians, as Sancho Panza,
C01 1780  5    the fat, grotesque "squire". Though his character is
C01 1790  4    broader and more comically rounded than the don, he
C01 1800  2    gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant
C01 1800 12    dignity- too. It is really as though the Russians have
C01 1810 10    seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality
C01 1820  4    and courage of supposed buffoons.
C01 1830  1       The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the
C01 1830  9    joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put
C01 1840  8    in command of an "island" is one of the best in the
C01 1850  7    film.
C01 1850  8    #@#
C01 1850  9    True, the pattern and flow of the drama have strong
C01 1860  5    literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the
C01 1870  2    first half, before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court.
C01 1870 12    But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth, and
C01 1880  7    the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads
C01 1890  5    of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy.
C01 1900  4       There are other good representations of peasants
C01 1910  1    and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed
C01 1910 12    and magnificently photographed in this last of the
C01 1920  7    Russian films to reach this country in the program
C01 1930  5    of joint cultural exchange.
C01 1930  9       Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a
C01 1940  9    nice ten-minute color film called "Sunday in Greenwich
C01 1950  4    Village", a tour of the haunts and joints.
