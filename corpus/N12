N12 0010  1       When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't
N12 0010  9    emerged from the livery stable, Brenner reentered the
N12 0020  7    hotel and faced Summers across the counter.
N12 0030  3       "I have a little job for you, Charlie. I'm sure
N12 0040  2    you won't mind doing me a small favor".
N12 0040 10       Brenner's voice was oily, but Summers wasn't fooled.
N12 0050  8    He moistened his lips uneasily.
N12 0060  2       "What is it you want me to do, Mr. Brenner"?
N12 0070  1       Brenner shrugged carelessly.
N12 0070  4       "It's very simple. I just want you to take a message
N12 0080  9    to Diane Molinari. Tell her to come here to the hotel".
N12 0090  7       Vastly relieved, Summers nodded and started toward
N12 0100  4    the door.
N12 0100  6       "One thing, Summers", Brenner said. "You're not
N12 0110  4    to mention my name. Tell her Curt Adams wants to see
N12 0120  4    her".
N12 0120  5       Summers pulled up short, and turned around.
N12 0130  1       "I don't know, Mr. Brenner", he said haltingly,
N12 0140  1    beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans. "It
N12 0140 10    doesn't seem quite right, telling her a thing like
N12 0150  8    that. Couldn't I just"- His voice trailed off into
N12 0160  8    silence.
N12 0160  9       Brenner continued to smile, but his eyes were cold.
N12 0170  6    He turned and looked around at the lobby as though
N12 0180  3    seeing things he hadn't before noticed.
N12 0180  9       "You know, Summers", he said thoughtfully. "Eagle's
N12 0190  6    Nest ought to have a fire company. If someone were
N12 0200  7    to drop a match in here, this place would go up like
N12 0210  5    a haystack". He started toward the stairway, then turned
N12 0220  2    to add, "Tell her to come to Adams's room, that Adams
N12 0230  1    is in trouble. Tell her to hurry".
N12 0230  8       "Yes sir". His face pale, Summers headed for the
N12 0240  6    street.
N12 0240  7    ##
N12 0240  8    Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a
N12 0250  7    precaution in case anyone should be watching. He paused
N12 0260  3    only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin
N12 0270  1    was still missing and that his own gray was all right,
N12 0270 12    then climbed through a back window and dropped to the
N12 0280  9    ground outside.
N12 0280 11       The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned
N12 0290  9    to its stall could indicate that Diane's information
N12 0300  4    had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret it this way.
N12 0310  4    A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of
N12 0320  2    escape in case it was needed. Probably his horse would
N12 0320 12    be close to where he was hiding.
N12 0330  6       From the back of the barn it was a simple matter
N12 0340  2    to reach Black's house without using the street. Curt
N12 0350  1    approached the place cautiously, and watched it several
N12 0350  9    minutes from the protection of a grove of trees.
N12 0360  7       There was a light in Black's front room, but drawn
N12 0370  5    curtains prevented any view of the interior. Curt circled
N12 0380  3    the house and located a barn out back. He could hear
N12 0390  1    horses moving around inside, and nothing else. There
N12 0390  9    was no lock on the door, only an iron hook which he
N12 0400  8    unfastened. He opened the door and went in, pulling
N12 0410  4    it shut behind him.
N12 0410  8       Again he stood in the darkness listening, but there
N12 0420  4    was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor.
N12 0430  2    He moved ahead carefully, his left hand in front of
N12 0430 12    him, and came to a wooden partition. Horse smell was
N12 0440 10    very strong, and he could hear the crunch of grain
N12 0450  6    being ground between strong jaws. He found a match
N12 0460  3    in his pocket and lit it.
N12 0460  9       There were two horses in the barn, a sway-backed
N12 0470  6    dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin. Curt snuffed out the
N12 0480  3    match.
N12 0480  4       It was certain now that Jess was in the house, but
N12 0490  2    also, presumably, was Stacey Black. Curt wanted to
N12 0490 10    get Jess alone, without interference from anyone, even
N12 0500  7    as spineless a person as the store owner.
N12 0510  5       He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought
N12 0520  3    of a means by which it might be solved. Reaching across
N12 0530  1    the side of the stall, he slapped the buckskin on the
N12 0530 12    rump. The startled animal let out a terrified squeal
N12 0540  7    and thrashed around in the stall.
N12 0550  1       As Curt had hoped, the house door banged open. He
N12 0550 11    slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly, its
N12 0560  9    hoofs rattling the side of the stall.
N12 0570  3       Curt moved over beside the door and waited. Presently
N12 0580  1    he heard footsteps crossing the yard, and Jess's smothered
N12 0580 10    curses. The door swung open, and Jess said sourly,
N12 0590  9    "What the hell's the matter with you?"
N12 0600  5       The horse continued to snort. Curt doubted that
N12 0610  4    any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance
N12 0620  1    in its owner's voice.
N12 0620  5       Jess cursed again, and entered the barn. A match
N12 0630  5    flared, and he reached above his head to light a lantern
N12 0640  1    which hung from a wire loop. As he crossed to the side
N12 0640 13    of the stall, Curt drew his gun and clicked back the
N12 0650 10    hammer.
N12 0650 11       "Before you try anything", he said. "Remember what
N12 0660  8    happened to Gruller".
N12 0670  1       Jess caught his breath in surprise. He started to
N12 0670 10    reach for his gun, but apparently thought better of
N12 0680  9    it.
N12 0680 10       "That's the stuff", Curt said. "Just hold it that
N12 0690  9    way". He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten
N12 0700  8    it with a sliding bolt. "You and I have a little talking
N12 0710  6    to do, Jess. You won't be needing this". He moved up
N12 0720  4    and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster.
N12 0730  1       "Damn you, Adams"- Jess was beginning to recover
N12 0730  9    from his initial shock. "We ain't got nothing to talk
N12 0740  8    about. If I don't come back in the house, Breed's going
N12 0750  8    to"-
N12 0750  9       "Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house.
N12 0760  6    About now he's probably having supper. That long ride
N12 0770  6    the four of you took must've given him a good appetite.
N12 0780  5    Now turn around so I can see your face".
N12 0790  1       Jess turned. There was raw fury in his eyes, and
N12 0790 11    the veins of his neck were swollen.
N12 0800  4       "You're about as dumb as they come, Adams. I don't
N12 0810  3    know what you're up to, but when Brenner"-
N12 0820  1       "You can forget about Brenner, too", Curt said.
N12 0820  9    "It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about".
N12 0830  8       "Arbuckle"? Jess stiffened. "I don't know nothin'
N12 0840  7    about him".
N12 0850  1       "No? I suppose you don't know anything about a piece
N12 0850 10    of two-by-four, either; one with blood all over it,
N12 0860  8    Arbuckle's blood". Curt's fingers put a little more
N12 0870  7    pressure on the trigger of his gun. "So help me, Crouch,
N12 0880  5    I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, before I
N12 0890  3    do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him. Now start
N12 0900  1    talking. Who told you to do it? Was it Dutch Brenner"?
N12 0910  1       Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand. He
N12 0910 11    drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's
N12 0920  8    face, but didn't finish the motion. Pistol-whipping
N12 0930  5    an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess,
N12 0940  3    but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it.
N12 0940 11       Apparently sensing this, and realizing that it gave
N12 0950  8    him an advantage, Jess became bold.
N12 0960  3       "Having all the guns makes you a big man, don't
N12 0970  1    it, Adams? If we was both armed, you wouldn't talk
N12 0970 11    so tough".
N12 0980  1       "No"? Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol
N12 0990  1    back into the holster. He retreated a step and holstered
N12 0990 11    his own.
N12 1000  1       "All right, Crouch; we're on even terms. Now draw"!
N12 1010  1       Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face. The fingers
N12 1010 10    of his right hand twisted into a claw, but he didn't
N12 1020 11    reach for the gun.
N12 1030  1       Curt, angry enough to be a little reckless, raised
N12 1030 10    his hands shoulder high.
N12 1040  3       "Does this make it any easier, coward"?
N12 1050  1       "I ain't drawin' against you", Jess said thickly.
N12 1050  9    "I heard how you outdrew Chico. I ain't a gunslinger".
N12 1070  1       "No. You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on
N12 1070 10    a man from behind and hits him with a club. I just
N12 1080  9    wanted to hear you say so".
N12 1090  1       Jess stared at him without answering and let his
N12 1090 10    hands fall to his sides. He had found Curt's weakness,
N12 1100  7    or what to Jess was a weakness, and was smart enough
N12 1110  5    to take advantage of it.
N12 1110 10       Somewhere in the distance, a woman screamed. Curt
N12 1120  7    was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention.
N12 1130  5    He had to make Jess talk, and he had to do it before
N12 1140  4    Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate. Once
N12 1150  1    more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster, only this
N12 1150 11    time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened
N12 1160  8    buckskin. He dropped his own beside it.
N12 1170  3       "We'll do it another way, then", he said harshly.
N12 1180  1       Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin
N12 1180  9    which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist. With
N12 1190 10    a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack.
N12 1200  7       Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing
N12 1210  3    fist, and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section.
N12 1220  1    It was like hitting a sack of salt. Pain shout up Curt's
N12 1230  1    arm clear to the shoulder, but Jess seemed hardly aware
N12 1230 11    that he had been hit. He slammed into the wall, bounced
N12 1240  9    back, and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which
N12 1250  5    sent him spinning. An inch lower and it would have
N12 1260  3    knocked him out. As it was, his vision blurred and
N12 1260 13    for a moment he was unable to move. When his eyes began
N12 1270 10    to focus, he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork.
N12 1280  7       Curt twisted to one side, and the tines of the fork
N12 1290  7    bit into the floor. Jess wasted a few seconds trying
N12 1300  2    to yank them loose. It gave Curt time to stagger to
N12 1300 13    his feet.
N12 1310  1       The tines broke off under Jess's twisting, and he
N12 1310 10    swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains
N12 1320 10    out. His aim was hurried; so the pitchfork whistled
N12 1330  6    over Curt's head.
N12 1330  9       By now Curt was seeing clearly again. He stepped
N12 1340  9    inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big
N12 1350  8    man's belly, putting everything he had behind them.
N12 1360  4    They made Jess double over. When his head came down,
N12 1370  1    Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head
N12 1370 11    first into the wall.
N12 1380  2       The building shook, setting the lantern to swaying,
N12 1380 10    and the buckskin to pitching again. Even Black's old
N12 1390  9    crowbait began to snort, and from the house Black yelled,
N12 1400  9    "Jess! What's going on out there"?
N12 1410  4       Jess didn't seem too sure himself. He lurched drunkenly
N12 1420  3    to his feet, lowered his head, and took one step away
N12 1430  1    from the wall. Curt caught him flush on the nose with
N12 1430 12    a blow which started at the floor.
N12 1440  5       Jess had had enough. Blood gushed from his nose,
N12 1450  3    and he backed off as rapidly as he could, stumbling
N12 1450 13    over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away
N12 1460 10    from Curt's fists.
N12 1470  1       Curt was in almost as bad shape, but he wouldn't
N12 1470 11    quit. He backed Jess into a corner, grabbed a handful
N12 1480  8    of the man's shirtfront, and drew back his right fist.
N12 1490  6       "Tell me about Arbuckle! You killed him, didn't
N12 1500  4    you"?
N12 1500  5       "It was Brenner's idea", Jess mumbled, dabbing at
N12 1510  5    his nose. "He found out about you and Arbuckle talking.
N12 1520  2    He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone
N12 1520 12    who tried to start trouble".
N12 1530  5       "You mean anyone who stood up for his rights", Curt
N12 1540  5    said. He let go of the shirt, and Jess slumped to the
N12 1550  3    floor. Turning his back, Curt crossed to the stall,
N12 1550 12    reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope, and
N12 1560  9    waved his hand in the animal's face.
N12 1570  3       The buckskin bolted out of the stall. Curt moved
N12 1580  2    in and picked up his gun. He shook loose straw out
N12 1580 13    of the action, and placed the gun in his holster. Leaving
N12 1590  9    Jess's where it lay, he left the stall.
N12 1600  5       "Get up, Crouch. We're going someplace".
N12 1610  1       Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled
N12 1610 10    the door.
N12 1620  2       "Who's in there"? Black called fearfully.
N12 1630  1       Curt opened the door, grabbed Black by the shoulder,
N12 1630 10    and pulled him into the barn.
N12 1640  4       "You're staying right here for a while. This dirty
N12 1650  3    coward just admitted killing Arbuckle. I'm going to
N12 1650 11    let him tell it to somebody else". He shoved Black
N12 1660 10    toward the stall, and pointed his pistol at Jess.
N12 1670  7       "Get out of here. You're coming along peacefully,
N12 1680  4    or I'll put a bullet in your leg".
N12 1690  1       Jess stumbled through the door. Curt followed, reaching
N12 1690  9    behind him to shut the door and hook it. Black would
N12 1700 10    have little trouble getting out, but it might delay
N12 1710  6    him a few minutes.
N12 1710 10       "Where're you takin' me"? Jess asked worriedly.
N12 1720  6       "We're going to Marshal Woods's house. Maybe if
N12 1730  6    the marshal hears this himself, it'll make a difference.
N12 1740  5    Somebody in this town must still have some backbone".
