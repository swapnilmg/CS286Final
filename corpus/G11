G11 0010  1    As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new "unnatural"
G11 0010 10    and internally controlled environments to cope even
G11 0020  7    more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties
G11 0030  5    of the external world. The useful suggestion of Professor
G11 0040  4    David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage
G11 0050  3    in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then
G11 0050 10    with our suggestion that science has provided us with
G11 0060  9    a rather successful technique for building protective
G11 0070  4    artificial environments. One wonders about its applicability
G11 0080  4    to people. Will advances in human sciences help us
G11 0090  2    build social structures and governments which will
G11 0090  9    enable us to cope with people as effectively as the
G11 0100  8    primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built
G11 0110  5    a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt
G11 0120  2    to a sea of molecular interaction? The answer is of
G11 0120 12    course yes. For the family is the simplest example
G11 0130  8    of just such a unit, composed of people, which gives
G11 0140  5    us both some immunity from, and a way of dealing with,
G11 0150  2    other people. Social invention did not have to await
G11 0150 11    social theory any more than use of the warmth of a
G11 0160 11    fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection
G11 0170  5    of a boat the formulations of Archimedes. But it has
G11 0180  4    been during the last two centuries, during the scientific
G11 0190  1    revolution, that our independence from the physical
G11 0190  8    environment has made the most rapid strides. We have
G11 0200  8    ample light when the sun sets; the temperature of our
G11 0210  5    homes is independent of the seasons; we fly through
G11 0220  2    the air, although gravity pulls us down; the range
G11 0220 11    of our voice ignores distance. At what stage are social
G11 0230  9    sciences then? Is the future of psychology akin to
G11 0240  7    the rich future of physics at the time of Newton? There
G11 0250  4    is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause
G11 0260  3    in Copernicus and in Freud. And it is certainly no
G11 0260 13    slight to either of them to compare both their achievements
G11 0270 10    and their impact.
G11 0280  1       Political theoretical understanding, although almost
G11 0280  6    at a standstill during this century, did develop during
G11 0290  7    the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and resulted
G11 0300  4    in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility
G11 0310  3    for man to coexist with man. Consitutional government,
G11 0320  1    popular vote, trial by jury, public education, labor
G11 0320  9    unions, cooperatives, communes, socialized ownership,
G11 0330  4    world courts, and the veto power in world councils
G11 0340  5    are but a few examples. Most of these, with horrible
G11 0350  2    exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an
G11 0350 12    attempt to quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny
G11 0360  9    its force, but as a means to survive and enjoy it.
G11 0370  5    The most effective political inventions seem to make
G11 0380  2    maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining
G11 0380 12    breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole
G11 0390 10    scheme. Just as present technology had to await the
G11 0400  6    explanations of physics, so one might expect that social
G11 0410  4    invention will follow growing sociological understanding.
G11 0420  1    We are desperately in the need of such invention, for
G11 0420 11    man is still very much at the mercy of man. In fact
G11 0430 11    the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is
G11 0440  5    day by day increasing our fear of each other.
G11 0450  1    #III#
G11 0450  2    I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different
G11 0460  1    fruit of science, the connection between scientific
G11 0460  8    understanding and fear. There are certainly large areas
G11 0470  8    of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves
G11 0480  5    and even without political invention can help to dispel
G11 0490  5    our present fears. Lucretius has remarked: "The reason
G11 0500  2    why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they
G11 0500 13    see all sorts of things happening in the earth and
G11 0510  9    sky with no discernable cause, and these they attribute
G11 0520  5    to the will of God". Perhaps things were even worse
G11 0530  4    then. It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears
G11 0540  1    of man. We get some clue from a few remembrances of
G11 0540 12    childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably
G11 0550  8    not much more afraid of people now than man ever was.
G11 0560  6    We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way
G11 0570  4    that people once feared comets. The bombs are as harmless
G11 0580  1    as an automobile in a garage. We are worried about
G11 0580 11    what people may do with them- that some crazy fool
G11 0590  8    may "push the button".
G11 0600  1       I am certainly not adequately trained to describe
G11 0600  8    or enlarge on human fears, but there are certain features
G11 0610  7    of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that
G11 0620  3    stand out quite clearly. They are in general those
G11 0630  2    fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer
G11 0630 12    or ritual. They include both individual fears and collective
G11 0640  8    ones. They arise in situations in which one believes
G11 0650  7    that what happens depends not only on the external
G11 0660  5    world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior
G11 0670  1    of the individual or group. Often it is recognized
G11 0670 10    that all the details of the pattern may not be essential
G11 0680  8    to the outcome but, because the pattern was empirically
G11 0690  5    determined and not developed through theoretical understanding,
G11 0700  2    one is never quite certain which behavior elements
G11 0710  1    are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized.
G11 0710  9    Yet often fear persists because, even with the most
G11 0720  8    rigid ritual, one is never quite free from the uneasy
G11 0730  6    feeling that one might make some mistake or that in
G11 0740  3    every previous execution one had been unaware of the
G11 0740 12    really decisive act. To say that science had reduced
G11 0750  8    many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent
G11 0760  5    statement that science eliminated much of magic and
G11 0770  4    superstition. But a somewhat more detailed analysis
G11 0780  1    of this process may be illuminating.
G11 0780  7       The frequently postulated antique worry that the
G11 0790  5    daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently
G11 0800  2    gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still
G11 0800 12    recognize. It is curious that even centuries of repetition
G11 0810  9    of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree
G11 0820  8    of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies
G11 0830  5    of the winter solstice. This and other fears of the
G11 0840  4    solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with
G11 0840 11    the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity
G11 0850  9    and then, more firmly, with the Newtonian innovation
G11 0860  6    of an universal force that could account quantitatively
G11 0870  3    for both terrestial and celestial motions. This understanding
G11 0880  3    provides a very simple example of the fact that one
G11 0890  1    can eliminate fear without instituting any controls.
G11 0890  8    In fact, although we have dispelled the fear, we have
G11 0900  8    not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no
G11 0910  5    dangers. There is still the remote possibility of planetoid
G11 0920  3    collision. A meteor could fall on San Francisco. Solar
G11 0930  1    activities could presumably bring long periods of flood
G11 0930  9    or drought. Our understanding of the solar system has
G11 0940  8    taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with
G11 0950  5    the appropriate action which, in this case, amounts
G11 0960  2    to doing nothing. Yet we no longer feel uneasy. This
G11 0960 12    almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive,
G11 0970  6    for there are some elements in common between the antique
G11 0980  6    fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and
G11 0990  4    our present fear of war. We, in our country, think
G11 1000  1    of war as an external threat which, if it occurs, will
G11 1000 12    not be primarily of our own doing. And yet we obviously
G11 1010  9    also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends
G11 1020  5    in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details
G11 1030  4    of how we behave. What elements of our behavior are
G11 1030 14    decisive? Our weapons production, our world prestige,
G11 1040  7    our ideas of democracy, our actions of trust or stubbornness
G11 1050  7    or secrecy or espionage? We have staved off a war and,
G11 1060  8    since our behavior has involved all these elements,
G11 1070  3    we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring
G11 1080  1    to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest
G11 1080 13    notion which parts are effective.
G11 1090  4       I think that we are here also talking of the kind
G11 1100  3    of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who
G11 1100 16    are approaching at night along the streets of a large
G11 1110  9    city. If an automobile were approaching him, he would
G11 1120  6    know what was required of him, even though he might
G11 1130  3    not be able to act quickly enough. With the group of
G11 1130 14    boys it is different. He does not know whether to look
G11 1140 11    up or look aside, to put his hands in his pockets or
G11 1150  9    to clench them at his side, to cross the street, or
G11 1160  4    to continue on the same side. When confronted with
G11 1170  1    a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what
G11 1170 13    any one of them might do to me or to himself or to
G11 1180 10    others. I believe that what I do has some effect on
G11 1190  5    his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune
G11 1200  1    with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble
G11 1200 10    more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the
G11 1210  9    carrying out of an experiment in physics. I am usually
G11 1220  6    filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting
G11 1230  2    slip all hell may break loose. Our inability to explain
G11 1240  1    why certain people are fond of us frequently induces
G11 1240 10    the same kind of ritual and malaise. We are forced,
G11 1250  7    in our behavior towards others, to adopt empirically
G11 1260  3    successful patterns in toto because we have such a
G11 1270  1    minimal understanding of their essential elements.
G11 1270  7       Our collective policies, group and national, are
G11 1280  6    similarly based on voodoo, but here we often lack even
G11 1290  6    the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged
G11 1300  2    in determing them. We use terms from our personal experience
G11 1310  1    with individuals such as "trust", "cheat", and "get
G11 1310  9    tough". We talk about national character in the same
G11 1320  9    way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial
G11 1330  7    bodies to move in circles. We perform elaborate international
G11 1340  4    exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding
G11 1350  3    of social cause and effect. Small wonder, then, that
G11 1360  2    we fear.
G11 1360  4       The achievements which dispelled our fears of the
G11 1370  2    cosmos took place three centuries ago. What additional
G11 1370 10    roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th
G11 1380  7    and 20th centuries played? In the physical sciences,
G11 1390  5    these achievements concern electricity, chemistry,
G11 1400  1    and atomic physics. In the life sciences, there has
G11 1400 10    been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease,
G11 1410  8    in the mechanisms of heredity, and in bio- and physiological
G11 1420  8    chemistry. The major effect of these advances appears
G11 1430  5    to lie in the part they have played in the industrial
G11 1440  2    revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding
G11 1450  1    has given us to build and manipulate a more protective
G11 1450 11    environment. In addition, our way of dealing directly
G11 1460  7    with natural phenomena has also changed. Even in domains
G11 1470  5    where detailed and predictive understanding is still
G11 1480  3    lacking, but where some explanations are possible,
G11 1480 10    as with lightning and weather and earthquakes, the
G11 1490  7    appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately
G11 1500  5    indicated.
G11 1500  6       Apparently the population as a whole eventually
G11 1510  5    acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the
G11 1520  3    scientists to modify its procedures and its fears.
G11 1520 11    How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting
G11 1530  9    separate subject for study. In some areas, the progress
G11 1540  8    is slower than in others. In agriculture, for example,
G11 1550  4    despite the advances in biology, elaborate rituals
G11 1560  2    tend to persist along with a continued sense of the
G11 1560 12    imminence of some natural disaster. In child care,
G11 1570  8    the opposite extreme prevails; procedures change rapidly
G11 1580  4    and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted
G11 1590  3    by established psychological theory. There are many
G11 1600  2    domains in which understanding has brought about widespread
G11 1600 10    and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear.
G11 1610  7    Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with
G11 1620  4    visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared.
G11 1630  3    The persistent horror of having a malformed child has,
G11 1640  2    I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained
G11 1640 11    any control over this misfortune, but precisely because
G11 1650  7    we have learned that we have so little control over
G11 1660  6    it. In fact, the recent warnings about the use of X-rays
G11 1670  5    have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which
G11 1680  1    now require more detailed understanding, and thus in
G11 1680  9    this instance, science has momentarily aggravated our
G11 1690  6    fears. In fact, insofar as science generates any fear,
G11 1700  5    it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets
G11 1710  3    but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise,
G11 1720  1    which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.
G11 1720  8       Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction
G11 1730  8    of fear through understanding is derived from our increased
G11 1740  6    knowledge of the nature of disease. The situation with
G11 1750  4    regard to our attitude and "control" of disease contains
G11 1760  2    close analogies to problems confronting us with respect
G11 1770  1    to people. The fear of disease was formerly very much
G11 1770 11    the kind of fear I have tried to describe.
