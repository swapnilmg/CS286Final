G44 0010  1       THE late R. G. Collingwood, a philosopher whose
G44 0010  9    work has proved helpful to many students of literature,
G44 0020  9    once wrote "We are all, though many of us are snobbish
G44 0030  9    enough to wish to deny it, in far closer sympathy with
G44 0040  5    the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with
G44 0050  3    Chaucer and Cimabue, or even Shakespeare and Titian.
G44 0050 11    By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our
G44 0060 10    minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien
G44 0070  9    present, and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese
G44 0080  4    colour-prints; but the possibility of this effort is
G44 0100  2    bound up with that development of historical thought
G44 0100 10    which is the greatest achievement of our civilization
G44 0110  6    in the last two centuries, and it is utterly impossible
G44 0120  6    to people in whom this development has not taken place.
G44 0130  3    The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy
G44 0140  1    contemporary art, to despise and dislike the art of
G44 0140 10    the recent past, and wholly to ignore everything else".
G44 0150  7       One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary
G44 0160  6    scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism
G44 0170  2    that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general
G44 0180  1    public, of the newspaper critic, and of the creative
G44 0180 10    artist himself. There results a study of literature
G44 0190  7    freed from the tyranny of the contemporary. Such study
G44 0200  4    may take many forms. The study of ideas in literature
G44 0210  2    is one of these. Of course, it goes without saying
G44 0210 12    that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the
G44 0220  8    contemporary scene. He will frequently return to it.
G44 0230  5    The continuities, contrasts, and similarities discernible
G44 0240  2    when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible
G44 0250  1    and the one is often understood through the other.
G44 0250 10       When we assert the value of such study, we find
G44 0260 10    ourselves committed to an important assumption. Most
G44 0270  5    students of literature, whether they call themselves
G44 0280  2    scholars or critics, are ready to argue that it is
G44 0280 12    possible to understand literary works as well as to
G44 0290  9    enjoy them. Many will add that we may find our enjoyment
G44 0300  8    heightened by our understanding. This understanding,
G44 0310  2    of course, may in its turn take many forms and some
G44 0320  1    of these- especially those most interesting to the
G44 0320  9    student of comparative literature- are essentially
G44 0330  3    historical. But the historian of literature need not
G44 0340  4    confine his attention to biography or to stylistic
G44 0350  1    questions of form, "texture", or technique. He may
G44 0350  9    also consider ideas. It is true that this distinction
G44 0360  8    between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary
G44 0370  4    since in the end we must admit that style and content
G44 0380  2    frequently influence or interpenetrate one another
G44 0380  8    and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight.
G44 0390  8    But, in general, we may argue that the student can
G44 0400  7    direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward
G44 0410  2    one or the other.
G44 0410  6       At this point a working definition of idea is in
G44 0420  5    order, although our first definition will have to be
G44 0430  2    qualified somewhat as we proceed. The term idea refers
G44 0430 11    to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness
G44 0440  6    as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional
G44 0450  5    experience. It is through such reflection that literature
G44 0460  3    approaches philosophy. An idea, let us say, may be
G44 0470  1    roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our
G44 0470 11    reflection may be concerned. In this essay, we are,
G44 0480  1    along with most historians, interested in the more
G44 0490  4    general or more inclusive ideas, that are so to speak
G44 0500  1    "writ large" in history of literature where they recur
G44 0500 10    continually. Outstanding among these is the idea of
G44 0510  8    human nature itself, including the many definitions
G44 0520  4    that have been advanced over the centuries; also secondary
G44 0530  3    notions such as the perfectibility of man, the depravity
G44 0540  1    of man, and the dignity of man. One might, indeed,
G44 0540 11    argue that the history of ideas, in so far as it includes
G44 0550 10    the literatures, must center on characterizations of
G44 0560  4    human nature and that the great periods of literary
G44 0570  2    achievement may be distinguished from one another by
G44 0570 10    reference to the images of human nature that they succeed
G44 0580 10    in fashioning.
G44 0590  1       We need not, to be sure, expect to find such ideas
G44 0590 12    in every piece of literature. An idea, of the sort
G44 0600  7    that we have in mind, although of necessity readily
G44 0610  3    available to imagination, is more general in connotation
G44 0620  1    than most poetic or literary images, especially those
G44 0620  9    appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment
G44 0630  9    of personal experience. Thus Burns's "My love is like
G44 0640  6    a red, red rose" and Hopkins' "The thunder-purple sea-beach,
G44 0650  6    plumed purple of thunder" although clearly intelligible
G44 0660  5    in content, hardly present ideas of the sort with which
G44 0670  7    we are here concerned. On the other hand, Arnold's
G44 0680  2    "The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea", taken in its
G44 0690  4    context, certainly does so.
G44 0690  8       Understanding a work of art involves recognition
G44 0700  5    of the ideas that it reflects or embodies. Thus the
G44 0710  3    student of literature may sometimes find it helpful
G44 0710 11    to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or
G44 0720 11    in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical
G44 0730  5    of its period. Again, he may discover embodied within
G44 0740  2    its texture a theme or idea that has been presented
G44 0740 12    elsewhere and at other times in various ways. Our understanding
G44 0750 10    will very probably require both these commentaries.
G44 0760  6    Very likely it will also include a recognition that
G44 0770  4    the work we are reading reflects or "belongs to" some
G44 0780  3    way of thought labelled as a "school" or an "-ism",
G44 0790  1    i.e. a complex or "syndrome" of ideas occurring together
G44 0800  1    with sufficient prominence to warrant identification.
G44 0800  7    Thus ideas like "grace", "salvation", and "providence"
G44 0810  5    cluster together in traditional Christianity. Usually
G44 0820  5    the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized
G44 0830  5    rendering or treatment of the ideas in question, so
G44 0840  3    that the student finds it necessary to distinguish
G44 0840 11    carefully between the several expressions of an "-ism"
G44 0850  9    or mode of thought. Accordingly we may speak of the
G44 0860  7    Platonism peculiar to Shelley's poems or the type of
G44 0870  6    Stoicism present in Henley's "Invictus", and we may
G44 0880  4    find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism
G44 0890  1    and contrasting each with other expressions of the
G44 0890  9    same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and
G44 0900  8    challenging enterprise. After all, Shelley is no "orthodox"
G44 0910  5    or Hellenic Platonist, and even his "romantic" Platonism
G44 0920  3    can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries.
G44 0930  1    Again, Henley's attitude of defiance which colors his
G44 0930  9    ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of
G44 0940  9    a Stoic thinker like Marcus Aurelius, whose gentle
G44 0950  5    acquiescence is almost Christian, comparable to the
G44 0960  4    patience expressed in Milton's sonnet on his own blindness.
G44 0970  2       In recent years, we have come increasingly to recognize
G44 0980  1    that ideas have a history and that not the least important
G44 0980 12    chapters of this history have to do with thematic or
G44 0990 10    conceptual aspects of literature and the arts, although
G44 1000  5    these aspects should be studied in conjunction with
G44 1010  2    the history of philosophy, of religion, and of the
G44 1010 11    sciences. When these fields are surveyed together,
G44 1020  7    important patterns of relationship emerge indicating
G44 1030  4    a vast community of reciprocal influence, a continuity
G44 1040  3    of thought and expression including many traditions,
G44 1040 10    primarily literary, religious, and philosophical, but
G44 1050  6    frequently including contact with the fine arts and
G44 1060  7    even, to some extent, with science.
G44 1070  1       Here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy
G44 1070 11    of history is built on the assumption that ideas are
G44 1080  9    the primary objectives of the historian's research.
G44 1090  5    Let us quote once more from R. G. Collingwood: "History
G44 1100  3    is properly concerned with the actions of human beings
G44 1110  4    ... Regarded from the outside, an action is an event
G44 1120  1    or series of events occurring in the physical world;
G44 1120 10    regarded from the inside, it is the carrying into action
G44 1130  8    of a certain thought ... The historian's business is
G44 1140  4    to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which
G44 1150  3    he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the
G44 1150 12    thoughts which constituted them. It is a characteristic
G44 1160  8    of thoughts that ... in re-thinking them we come, ipso
G44 1170  8    facto, to understand why they were thought". Such an
G44 1180  4    understanding, although it must seek to be sympathetic,
G44 1190  1    is not a matter of intuition. "History has this in
G44 1190 11    common with every other science: that the historian
G44 1200  8    is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge,
G44 1210  6    except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting
G44 1220  3    to himself in the first place, and secondly to any
G44 1220 13    one else who is both able and willing to follow his
G44 1230 11    demonstration, the grounds upon which it is based.
G44 1240  6    This is what was meant, above, by describing history
G44 1250  2    as inferential. The knowledge in virtue of which a
G44 1250 11    man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence
G44 1260 11    at his disposal proves about certain events". It is
G44 1270  6    obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the
G44 1280  4    ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout
G44 1290  1    a given period will find the art and literature of
G44 1290 11    that age one of his central and major concerns, by
G44 1300  7    no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant
G44 1310  3    historical research.
G44 1310  5       The student of ideas and their place in history
G44 1320  5    will always be concerned with the patterns of transition,
G44 1330  2    which are at the same time patterns of transformation,
G44 1330 11    whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another.
G44 1340 10    Let us survey for a moment the development of modern
G44 1350  8    thought- turning our attention from the Reformation
G44 1360  4    toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that
G44 1370  2    follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades.
G44 1370 10    We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy
G44 1380  7    from its manifestation in religious practice and theological
G44 1390  4    reflection through practical politics and political
G44 1400  3    theory into literature and the arts. Finally we may
G44 1400 12    note that the idea appears in educational theory where
G44 1410  9    its influence is at present widespread. No one will
G44 1420  7    deny that such broad developments and transitions are
G44 1430  4    of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas
G44 1440  1    in literature would be woefully incomplete without
G44 1440  8    frequent reference to them. Still, we must remember
G44 1450  7    that we cannot construct and justify generalizations
G44 1460  2    of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special
G44 1470  1    instances of influence moving between such areas as
G44 1470  9    theology, philosophy, political thought, and literature.
G44 1480  5    The actual moments of contact are vitally important.
G44 1490  4    These moments are historical events in the lives of
G44 1500  3    individual authors with which the student of comparative
G44 1500 11    literature must be frequently concerned.
G44 1510  5       Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring
G44 1520  5    literary influence on the Western world has been that
G44 1530  4    of the Old and New Testament. Certainly one of the
G44 1540  2    most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual
G44 1540 12    and cultural life of any period of Western civilization
G44 1550  8    during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has
G44 1560  5    to do with the way in which its leaders have read and
G44 1570  4    interpreted the Bible. This reading and the comments
G44 1580  1    that it evoked constitute the influence. A contrast
G44 1580  9    of the scripture reading of, let us say, St. Augustine,
G44 1590  8    John Bunyan, and Thomas Jefferson, all three of whom
G44 1600  6    found in such study a real source of enlightenment,
G44 1610  1    can tell us a great deal about these three men and
G44 1610 12    the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious
G44 1620  9    expression. In much the same way, we recognize the
G44 1630  8    importance of Shakespeare's familarity with Plutarch
G44 1640  3    and Montaigne, of Shelley's study of Plato's dialogues,
G44 1650  2    and of Coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings
G44 1660  1    of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to
G44 1660  9    Schelling and William Godwin, through which so many
G44 1670  8    abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English
G44 1680  6    men of letters.
G44 1680  9       We may also recognize cases in which the poets have
G44 1690  7    influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the
G44 1700  4    scientists. English philosopher Samuel Alexander's
G44 1710  1    debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting
G44 1710 10    example, as also A. N. Whitehead's understanding of
G44 1720  8    the English romantics, chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth.
G44 1730  5    Hegel's profound admiration for the insights of the
G44 1740  6    Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical
G44 1750  3    influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy. Again
G44 1750  9    the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating,
G44 1760  9    if to our minds grotesque, anticipation of the theory
G44 1770  6    of chance variations and the natural elimination of
G44 1780  4    the unfit in Lucretius, who in turn seems to have borrowed
G44 1790  3    the concept from the philosopher Empedocles.
G44 1790  9       Here an important caveat is in order. We must avoid
G44 1800 10    the notion, suggested to some people by examples such
G44 1810  7    as those just mentioned, that ideas are "units" in
G44 1820  4    some way comparable to coins or counters that can be
G44 1830  2    passed intact from one group of people to another or
G44 1830 12    even, for that matter, from one individual to another.
