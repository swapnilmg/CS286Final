N02 0010  1       Gavin paused wearily. "You can't stay here with
N02 0010  9    me. It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn".
N02 0020 10       "You can't make me go".
N02 0030  4       Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to
N02 0040  2    rock. He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had
N02 0040 12    left him there, to rock to death on the porch of the
N02 0050 11    Splendide. It was the only thing in his life for which
N02 0060  7    he felt guilt. Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders
N02 0070  4    shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat, the
N02 0080  1    stored pain shattering free in slow gasps, terrible
N02 0080  9    to see. Clayton tried to call back the face of the
N02 0090  9    man he had known. Against that other man he could rally
N02 0100  5    his anger; against this bent man in the chair he was
N02 0110  3    powerless.
N02 0110  4       Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop
N02 0120  3    to catch the words. "Do you remember Big Charlie"?
N02 0120 12    he whispered. "He stuck with me all these years. Just
N02 0130 10    a half-breed 'pache, never said much, never meant anythin
N02 0140  8    to me, but he stuck with me. He got into a fight with
N02 0150  8    Tom English, your brother's son. It was a fair fight,
N02 0160  6    the boy provoked it- Big Charlie told me so. I believed
N02 0170  3    him. They killed Big Charlie, dumped his body in my
N02 0170 13    rose garden two nights ago. My men, they all left me.
N02 0180 11    Just cleared out. I didn't understand why, Clay. They
N02 0190  7    just all cleared out. I treated them fair ..."
N02 0210  1       He wiped his lips with a sleeve, then stared at
N02 0220  2    Clayton in a childish kind of wonder. "Do you mean"-
N02 0220 12    he asked almost shyly- "you want me to go with you,
N02 0230 11    wherever you're goin"?
N02 0240  2       "Yes".
N02 0240  3       "You don't hate me any more"?
N02 0250  1       Clayton choked, shook his head, murmuring, "No".
N02 0260  1       "Come here". The old man beckoned with one finger
N02 0260 10    and Clayton went forward to him. Gavin slipped his
N02 0270  8    arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely. "All
N02 0280  5    my life", he said, "I tried. I tried. I saw you driftin
N02 0290  5    away- but I tried. And you wanted no part of me when
N02 0300  4    I had so much to give. Now there's nothin left of me.
N02 0310  1    Laurel is gone, my men are gone, Ed is dead- and you
N02 0310 13    come to me, to help me. Oh! God in Heaven, I can't
N02 0320  9    refuse you now. That would mock me too much! Can't
N02 0330  6    let you go way from me again ..." He closed his eyes,
N02 0340  4    ashamed of his tears.
N02 0340  8       "I'll go, Clay".
N02 0350  1       Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped
N02 0350  9    back. The eyes followed him fearfully. "The horses.
N02 0360  7    There isn't much time. I'll saddle the horses and bring
N02 0370  7    them round. You get ready".
N02 0380  1       He burst from the hot confinement of the room into
N02 0380 11    the cold night air. Gavin's stallion was in the barn
N02 0390  9    and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket,
N02 0400  5    working by touch in the darkness, comforting the animal
N02 0410  3    with easy words. When he had finished he led him and
N02 0420  1    the mare to the porch. The stallion had smelled the
N02 0420 11    mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf, shaking
N02 0430  9    his head. Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the
N02 0450  4    veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck.
N02 0460  2    The mare had backed away. "You take it easy, boy",
N02 0460 12    Clayton whispered. "She doesn't want you now. You take
N02 0470  9    it easy, your time will come".
N02 0480  3       Gavin stood on the porch, a thin figure. He had
N02 0490  2    taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from
N02 0490 13    his hand, the stock bumping on the wood floor. Clayton
N02 0500  9    called to him and he came slowly down the steps.
N02 0510  5       "Clay", he said, "where are we goin"?
N02 0520  2       "To a ranch in the valley. There's someone there
N02 0530  1    I have to see. We may take her with us- to California.
N02 0530 13    I don't know yet, it's crazy; I have to think about
N02 0540 10    it. But California is where we're goin".
N02 0550  5       "California". Gavin began to nod. "That's a new
N02 0560  5    land. A man could make a mark there. two men, together
N02 0570  2    like us, we could do somethin fine out there, maybe
N02 0570 12    find a place where no one's ever been. Start out fresh,
N02 0580 10    the two of us, like nothin had ever happened".
N02 0590  5       "Yes, like a father and son".
N02 0600  1       "I made you what you are", Gavin whispered. "I made
N02 0610  1    you so you could stand up. I made you a man".
N02 0610 12       "Yes, Gavin, you did".
N02 0620  3       He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's
N02 0630  2    quivering neck. "Help me up, Clay. Help me up, I feel
N02 0640  2    kind of stiff". Clayton lifted him gently into the
N02 0640 11    saddle, like a child. "I hate to leave my garden",
N02 0650  9    Gavin said. "They'll trample it down. I loved my garden".
N02 0660  8       "It will grow again- in California".
N02 0670  5       "I loved this valley", he whispered huskily. "Lived
N02 0680  2    alone here for three years, before any man came. Lived
N02 0690  1    alone by the river. It was nice then, so peaceful and
N02 0690 12    quiet. There was no one but me. I don't want to leave
N02 0700 11    it".
N02 0700 12       Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's
N02 0710  9    rump. The two horses broke from the yard, from the
N02 0720  7    circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the
N02 0730  4    house, into the darkness.
N02 0730  8    #THIRTY-FIVE#
N02 0730 10    THEY RODE at a measured pace through the valley. Dawn
N02 0740 10    would come soon and the night was at its coldest. The
N02 0750  9    moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains
N02 0760  4    and the land, seen through eyes that had grown accustomed
N02 0770  1    to the absence of light, looked primeval, as if no
N02 0770 11    man had ever trespassed before. It looked as Gavin
N02 0780  7    had first seen it years ago, on those nights when he
N02 0790  6    slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the
N02 0800  3    hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in
N02 0800 16    the moon's wind- a savage land, untenanted and brooding,
N02 0810  7    too strong to be broken by the will of men. Gavin sighed
N02 0820  9    bitterly. In that inert landscape the caravan of his
N02 0830  5    desires passed before his mind. He saw them ambushed,
N02 0840  2    strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying.
N02 0840 12    In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of
N02 0850  9    the relationships he had sought so desperately, but
N02 0860  5    they would not come to life. The silence oppressed
N02 0870  1    him, made him bend low over the horse's neck as if
N02 0870 12    to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away
N02 0880 11    and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its
N02 0890  5    slow search.
N02 0890  7       They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against
N02 0900  6    the black hills. Then at last the darkness began to
N02 0910  3    dissolve. A bold line of violet broke loose from the
N02 0920  1    high ridge of the mountains, followed by feathers of
N02 0920 10    red that swept the last stars from the sky. The wan
N02 0930  8    light spread over the ground and the valley revealed
N02 0940  3    in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences
N02 0950  1    and palely shadowed gullies.
N02 0950  5    ##
N02 0950  6    THEY HAD been seen as soon as they left the ranch,
N02 0960  6    picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful
N02 0970  2    eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in
N02 0970 13    the windless shelter of the trees. The two men whipped
N02 0980  9    their horses into town and flung themselves up the
N02 0990  6    steps of the saloon, crying their intelligence.
N02 1000  1       The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's
N02 1010  1    drinking, their faces red and baggy. But the liquor
N02 1010 10    had flushed their courage. They greeted the news angrily,
N02 1020  7    as though they had been cheated of purpose. Lester
N02 1030  4    heard their muttering, saw their eyes reveal their
N02 1040  1    desire. He worked his tongue round and round in the
N02 1040 11    hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat,
N02 1050 10    dry and cracked. "He's leavin. That's what you wanted,
N02 1060  6    isn't it? Clayton is with him, takin him out of the
N02 1070  7    valley. You can't"-
N02 1070 10       "Keep out of this", Purvis snarled. "He's not your
N02 1080  8    brother, he's Gavin's son. You see, he lied to us when
N02 1090  8    he said he was leavin alone".
N02 1100  1       Joe Purvis was thinking back many years. First he
N02 1100 10    thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told
N02 1110 10    him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end
N02 1120  6    of the valley. He remembered Gavin's smirk, his own
N02 1130  3    cringing feeling, his impotence. Then he thought of
N02 1130 11    a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the
N02 1140  9    Gap. His wife had said to him: "Nellie is in love with
N02 1150  9    Clayton Roy. He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's
N02 1160  7    party. He treats her like she was dirt. And you stand
N02 1170  5    by like a fool and let him do it ..."
N02 1180  1       He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon
N02 1180  8    when he had asked him what he would do if they brought
N02 1190  9    their cattle to water. It was the night Clayton had
N02 1200  5    tricked them in the poker game. "You're Gavin's son",
N02 1210  2    Joe Purvis had said.
N02 1210  6       He turned to Lester. "You brought him back to this
N02 1220  7    valley thinkin he would help you find your boy. He
N02 1230  4    meant to help Gavin all the time. He made a fool of
N02 1240  1    you, Lester". He swung round to the other men- "We
N02 1240 11    can catch him easy! There are plenty of fresh horses
N02 1250  9    halfway at my place. If we let them go, they won't
N02 1260  7    stay away, they'll find men to ride with them and they'll
N02 1270  4    be back. There's only one way they can get out now
N02 1280  2    and that's through the Gap- if we ride hard we can
N02 1280 13    take them".
N02 1290  1       Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder. The
N02 1300  1    boy jerked away.
N02 1300  4       "He killed Tom- do you understand that"? Cabot turned
N02 1310  3    back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they
N02 1320  1    would do, wild to break from the cloying warmth of
N02 1320 11    the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night. He fled
N02 1330  8    through the door and down the steps, running, and the
N02 1340  4    men grunted and followed, pushing Lester to one side
N02 1350  2    where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of
N02 1350 12    his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light.
N02 1360  9    Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave.
N02 1370  6    They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at
N02 1380  3    a safe distance.
N02 1380  6    #THIRTY-SIX#
N02 1380  8    IN THE cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground,
N02 1390  8    then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley
N02 1400  5    clear. The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight
N02 1410  1    swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white
N02 1410 11    and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses
N02 1420 10    flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow. When
N02 1430  6    they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind
N02 1440  5    them, strung out on the prairie in a flat black line.
N02 1450  1    The wind of their running was cold and wild, the horses
N02 1450 12    were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black
N02 1460  8    pennants in the wind.
N02 1470  1       The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray
N02 1470 11    of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion. He looked
N02 1480  8    over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers.
N02 1490  5    They neither gained nor fell back. He rode low on the
N02 1500  4    mare's neck. Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off
N02 1500 13    the trail and pointed for the Gap, no more than a mile
N02 1510 12    away.
N02 1510 13       Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement. He did
N02 1520  8    not look back; he could feel more than hear the staccato
N02 1530  8    beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to
N02 1540  5    the north. He knew who was riding after him- the men
N02 1550  3    he had known all his life, the men who had worked for
N02 1550 15    him, sworn their loyalty to him. Now they were riding
N02 1560  9    to kill him. And he was fleeing, running- fleeing his
N02 1570  5    death and his life at the same time. The land over
N02 1580  4    which he sped was the land he had created and lived
N02 1580 15    in: his valley. With every leaping stride of the horse
N02 1590 10    beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that
N02 1600  8    had been his, that he would never see again. The Gap
N02 1610  5    looming before him- the place where had confronted
N02 1620  1    Jack English on that day so many years ago- was his
N02 1620 12    exit from all that had meaning to him.
N02 1630  7       California is too far, he thought. He would never
N02 1640  4    reach California. He was too old- when he passed up
N02 1650  2    and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail
N02 1650 12    he could see ahead, he was passing from life.
