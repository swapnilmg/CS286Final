A25 0010  1    _ASILOMAR, MARCH 26_
A25 0010  4       Vast spraying programs conducted by "technicians
A25 0020  1    with narrow training and little wisdom" are endangering
A25 0020  9    crops and wildlife, Carl W. Buchheister, president
A25 0030  7    of the National Audubon Society, said today.
A25 0040  4       "It is like handing a loaded .45 automatic to an
A25 0050  4    8-year-old and telling him to run out and play", he
A25 0060  1    commented.
A25 0060  2       Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon
A25 0070  1    Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed
A25 0070  8    to destroy its target, the fire ant.
A25 0080  6       "But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer
A25 0090  5    and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane
A25 0100  1    crop", he said.
A25 0100  4       The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying
A25 0110  3    had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming. There
A25 0120  1    have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service,
A25 0130  1    whose officials pride themselves in their scientific
A25 0140  7    training, he added.
A25 0150  1       "The news of their experiments reach the farmers
A25 0150  9    who, forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural
A25 0160  8    enemies of insects and rodents, are encouraged to try
A25 0170  5    to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their
A25 0180  3    grapes or their blueberries", Buchheister told the
A25 0180 10    delegates.
A25 0190  1       In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial
A25 0190  9    spraying, Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness
A25 0200  8    bill, creation of national seashore parks, including
A25 0210  6    Point Reyes; preservation of the wetlands where birds
A25 0220  6    breed; a pesticides co-ordination act; stronger water
A25 0230  3    pollution control programs, and Federal ratification
A25 0240  1    of an international convention to halt pollution of
A25 0240  9    the sea by oil.
A25 0260  1       The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in
A25 0260 10    Marin county on Friday officially became the property
A25 0270  8    of the National Audubon Society.
A25 0280  2       Mrs. Norman Livermore, president of the Marin Conservation
A25 0290  2    League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands
A25 0300  1    tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister,
A25 0300 10    president of the Society.
A25 0310  4       The presentation was made before several hundred
A25 0320  2    persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney
A25 0320 12    Hall, College of Marin, Kentfield.
A25 0330  5       Buchheister pledged the land would be an "inviolate"
A25 0340  5    sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.
A25 0360  1       Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy
A25 0360  8    Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed
A25 0370  6    in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly
A25 0380  6    of a Heinkel bomber.
A25 0380 10       The World War II German bomber rolled down a runway
A25 0390  9    and took off.
A25 0400  1       The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive
A25 0400 11    was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the
A25 0410  9    airstrip. This had never been done before.
A25 0420  2       Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is
A25 0420 11    an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and
A25 0430  7    Space Division at Sunnyvale, where he played a key
A25 0440  8    role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile.
A25 0450  4       He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that
A25 0460  3    historic flight in 1944.
A25 0460  7       "The first two pilots had crashed", he said. "I
A25 0470  6    had developed the machines and therefore knew them.
A25 0480  3    It was time to go up myself".
A25 0480 10       Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's
A25 0490  5    super-secret "Reichenberg project", which remained
A25 0500  3    unknown to the Allies until after the war.
A25 0510  1       About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were
A25 0510 11    to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive
A25 0520  7    warhead. The target was Allied shipping- a desperate
A25 0530  3    effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe.
A25 0540  2       The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's
A25 0550  1    flight.
A25 0550  2       Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled
A25 0550 10    by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist
A25 0560  8    waited while the bomber gained altitude.
A25 0570  5       At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled "release", and
A25 0580  3    started the roaring pulse-jet engine- then streaked
A25 0590  1    away from beneath the Heinkel.
A25 0590  6       To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became
A25 0600  5    a faint black speck, hurtling through the sky at the
A25 0610  4    then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h.
A25 0610 10       It was probably man's first successful flight in
A25 0620  6    a missile. "She flew beautifully", said Fiedler. "There
A25 0630  4    was only one power control- a valve to adjust the fuel
A25 0640  5    flow. I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test
A25 0650  3    strip".
A25 0650  4       Using a steering system that controlled the modified
A25 0660  2    rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons,
A25 0670  1    Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially
A25 0670 11    bolted under the fuselage.
A25 0680  2       He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing
A25 0680 11    speed of 200 m.p.h.- fast even for a modern jet plane
A25 0690 11    touchdown- and banked into the airfield.
A25 0700  8       Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing
A25 0710  4    strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown- then
A25 0720  4    in a streamer of dust it landed.
A25 0720 11       Fiedler went on to make several other test flights
A25 0730  5    before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles.
A25 0740  2       The missiles were to be armed with an underwater
A25 0750  1    bomb. Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into
A25 0750 11    the water, striking below the waterline of individual
A25 0760  7    ships.
A25 0760  8       A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks
A25 0770  9    of volunteers, but the project was halted before the
A25 0780  5    end of the war, and the missiles later fell into Allied
A25 0790  2    hands.
A25 0790  3       Now a family man with three children, Fiedler lives
A25 0800  2    in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant
A25 0800 11    at Sunnyvale. His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.
A25 0810  9       "It's so quiet", he said, "so slow, serene- and
A25 0820  9    so challenging".

A25 0940  1       Dr. Albert Schweitzer, world-famous theologian and
A25 0945  1    medical missionary, has endorsed an Easter March for
A25 0950  8    Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale.
A25 0960  4       Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service,
A25 0970  3    a Quaker organization, will march to San Francisco
A25 0980  1    for a rally in Union Square at 2 p. m. Saturday.
A25 0990  1       In a letter to the American Friends Service, Dr.
A25 0990 10    Schweitzer wrote:
A25 1000  2       "Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep
A25 1010  1    busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves
A25 1010  9    in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war
A25 1020  6    should break out.
A25 1020  9       "They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of
A25 1030  9    each other since these weapons imply the possibility
A25 1040  4    of such grisly surprise attack. The only way out of
A25 1050  4    this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear
A25 1050 13    weapons; otherwise no peace is possible.
A25 1060  6       "Governments apparently do not feel obligated to
A25 1070  6    make the people adequately aware of this danger; therefore
A25 1080  2    we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly
A25 1090  1    stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out
A25 1090 10    of their complacency".
A25 1110  1       A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday
A25 1110  9    in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein, 47,
A25 1120  8    who collected big fees as a "labor consultant" and
A25 1130  5    operator of a janitors' service.
A25 1140  1       Before he testified for 20 minutes, Stein, who lives
A25 1140  9    at 3300 Lake Shore dr., admitted to reporters that
A25 1150  7    he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums.
A25 1160  4    #GLIMCO A BUDDY#
A25 1160  7    Among his gangland buddies, he said, were Joseph [Joey]
A25 1170  3    Glimco, a mob labor racketeer, and four gang gambling
A25 1180  5    chiefs, Gus [Slim] Alex, Ralph Pierce, Joe [Caesar]
A25 1190  3    DiVarco, and Jimmy [Monk] Allegretti.
A25 1200  1       Another hoodlum, Louis Arger, drew $39,000 from
A25 1200  8    Stein's janitor firm, the National Maintenance company,
A25 1210  6    in three years ending in 1959, Stein disclosed in an
A25 1220  5    interview.
A25 1220  6       "I put Arger on the payroll because he promised
A25 1230  4    to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier",
A25 1240  2    Stein said. "But Arger never was able to produce it,
A25 1240 12    so I cut him off my payroll".
A25 1250  7    #CONNECTION IS SOUGHT#
A25 1250 10    Other witnesses, after appearances before the jury,
A25 1260  6    which reportedly is probing into possible income tax
A25 1270  5    violations, disclosed that government prosecutors were
A25 1280  2    attempting to connect Stein and his company with a
A25 1280 11    number of gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.
A25 1290  6       The federal lawyers, according to their witnesses,
A25 1300  5    also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant.
A25 1310  3    Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments
A25 1320  1    and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at
A25 1320  9    543 Madison st.
A25 1330  2       The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick
A25 1340  1    Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses.
A25 1340  9    #LEE A WITNESS#
A25 1350  3    Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee, director of McCormick
A25 1360  2    Place; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor
A25 1370  1    company, 3247 S. Kedzie av., Dominic Senese, a teamster
A25 1370 10    union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin
A25 1380 11    of Tony Accardo, onetime gang chief; and Frank W. Pesce,
A25 1390  7    operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm, the
A25 1400  4    Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215 Blue Island
A25 1410  3    av.
A25 1410  4       Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement
A25 1420  3    in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors
A25 1430  1    in McCormick Place. Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per
A25 1430 11    cent of the janitors' pay. Stein estimated this amount
A25 1440  8    at "about $1,500 or $1,600 a month".
A25 1450  5    #A $12,500 PAYMENT#
A25 1450  8    Leavitt, as he entered the jury room, said he was prepared
A25 1460  8    to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm
A25 1470  4    paid to Stein for "labor consultant work" with five
A25 1480  2    unions which organized Leavitt's workers. Leavitt identified
A25 1490  1    the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters
A25 1490  9    union, a salesman's union, the janitors' union, and
A25 1500  6    a bottling workers' union.
A25 1510  1       Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned
A25 1510  7    him closely about "five or six loans" totaling about
A25 1520  8    $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the
A25 1530  7    last year.
A25 1530  9       All of the loans, in amounts up to $5,000 each,
A25 1540  7    have been repaid by Stein, according to Leavitt. Stein
A25 1550  4    said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to "meet the
A25 1560  2    payroll" at National Maintenance company.
A25 1560  7       The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the
A25 1570  9    headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers'
A25 1580  4    union at 1213-15 Blue Island av.
A25 1590  1       The radiation station of the Chicago board of health
A25 1590 10    recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation
A25 1600  9    per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday.
A25 1610  3       The reading, which has been watched with interest
A25 1620  2    since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was
A25 1620 11    4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below
A25 1630 11    the danger point, according to the board of health.
A25 1640  7       The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive
A25 1650  3    fallout from the test might arrive here next week.
A25 1660  1    A board of health spokesman said there is no reason
A25 1660 11    to believe that an increase in the level here will
A25 1670  8    occur as a result of the detonation.
A25 1690  1       Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av., Wilmette,
A25 1690 10    was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant
A25 1700  7    charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount
A25 1710  4    of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association,
A25 1720  4    1 S. Dearborn st., where he formerly was employed as
A25 1730  2    an attorney.
A25 1730  4       Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may
A25 1740  3    total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association
A25 1740 11    estimated its loss at approximately $10,000.
A25 1750  6    #LIEN PAYMENTS INVOLVED#
A25 1750  9    Huff's attorney, Antone F. Gregorio, quoted his client
A25 1760  8    as saying that part of the embezzlement represented
A25 1770  7    money paid to Huff, as attorney for the loan association,
A25 1780  6    in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on
A25 1790  4    which the association held mortgages.
A25 1790  9       Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay
A25 1800  9    "the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living".
A25 1810  5       Huff, who received a salary of $109 a week from
A25 1820  5    the loan association from October of 1955 until September
A25 1830  1    of this year, said that his private practice was not
A25 1830 11    lucrative. Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their
A25 1840  9    four children, 6 to 10 years old, in a $25,000 home
A25 1850  6    with a $17,000 mortgage.
A25 1850 10    #CHARGE LISTS 3 CHECKS#
A25 1860  2    The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed
A25 1860 12    by Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.
A25 1870  8       The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to
A25 1880  6    report for work on Sept. 18. On that date, according
A25 1890  4    to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room in
A25 1900  2    the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av. There,
A25 1900 11    Gregorio said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his
A25 1910  9    offense.
A25 1910 10       Later, Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at
A25 1920  9    the Sherman House, using a credit card. All bounced.
A25 1930  6       When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there
A25 1940  4    Monday, hotel officials called police.
A25 1950  1    _BONN, OCT. 24 (UPI)_
A25 1950  5       - Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement
A25 1960  3    under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims
A25 1970  2    of Nazi persecution, it was announced today.
