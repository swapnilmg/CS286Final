G56 0010  1       Criticism is as old as literary art and we can set
G56 0010 12    the stage for our study of three moderns if we see
G56 0020  9    how certain critics in the past have dealt with the
G56 0030  5    ethical aspects of literature. I have chosen five contrasting
G56 0040  2    pairs, ten men in all, and they are arranged in roughly
G56 0050  1    chronological order. Such a list must naturally be
G56 0050  9    selective, and the treatment of each man is brief,
G56 0060  7    for I am interested only in their general ideas on
G56 0070  3    the moral measure of literature. Altogether, the list
G56 0080  1    will give us considerable variety in attitudes and
G56 0080  9    some typical ones, for these critics range all the
G56 0090  7    way from censors to those who consider art above ethics,
G56 0100  4    all the way from Plato to Poe. And most of the great
G56 0110  2    periods are represented, because we will compare Plato
G56 0110 10    and Aristotle from the golden age of Greece; Stephen
G56 0120  8    Gosson and Sir Philip Sidney from renaissance England;
G56 0130  5    Dr. Johnson and William Hazlitt of the eighteenth and
G56 0140  6    early nineteenth centuries in England; and James Russell
G56 0150  4    Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth century American
G56 0160  3    letters.
G56 0160  4    #PLATO AND ARISTOTLE#
G56 0160  7    Plato and Aristotle agree on some vital literary issues.
G56 0170  7    They both measure literature by moral standards, and
G56 0180  5    in their political writings both allow for censorship,
G56 0190  2    but the differences between them are also significant.
G56 0190 10    While Aristotle censors literature only for the young,
G56 0200  8    Plato would banish all poets from his ideal state.
G56 0210  7    Even more important, in his Poetics, Aristotle differs
G56 0220  3    somewhat from Plato when he moves in the direction
G56 0230  2    of treating literature as a unique thing, separate
G56 0230 10    and apart from its causes and its effects.
G56 0240  7       All through The Republic, Plato attends to the way
G56 0250  6    art relates to the general life and ultimately to a
G56 0260  3    good life for his citizens. In short, he is constantly
G56 0260 13    concerned with the ethical effects. When he discusses
G56 0270  8    the subject matter of poetry, he asks what moral effect
G56 0280  8    the scenes will have. When he turns briefly to literary
G56 0290  5    style, in the Third Book, he again looks to the effect
G56 0300  3    on the audience. He explains that his citizens must
G56 0300 12    not be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of
G56 0310  9    the gods or heroes that one finds in much poetry, and
G56 0320  7    he observes that all "these pantomimic gentlemen" will
G56 0330  3    be sent to another state. Only those story tellers
G56 0340  1    will remain who can "imitate the style of the virtuous".
G56 0350  1       Plato is, at times, just as suspicious of the poets
G56 0350 11    themselves as he is of their work. When he discusses
G56 0360  8    tyrants in the Eighth Book of The Republic, he pictures
G56 0370  5    the poets as willing to praise the worst rulers. But
G56 0380  3    the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears
G56 0390  1    in the Tenth Book, and it is derived from his doctrine
G56 0390 12    of ideal forms. In Plato's mind there is an irresolvable
G56 0400  8    conflict between the poet and the philosopher, because
G56 0410  6    the poet imitates only particular objects and is incapable
G56 0420  4    of rising to the first level of abstraction, much less
G56 0430  2    the highest level of ideal forms. True reality, of
G56 0430 11    course, is the ideal, and the poet knows nothing of
G56 0440  9    this; only the philosopher knows the truth.
G56 0450  4       Poets, moreover, dwell on human passions. And with
G56 0460  2    this point about the passions, we encounter Plato's
G56 0460 10    dualism. The same sort of thinking plays so large a
G56 0470 10    part in both Babbitt and More, that we must examine
G56 0480  6    it in some detail. Plato feels that man has two competing
G56 0490  4    aspects, his rational faculty and his irrational. We
G56 0500  2    can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures,
G56 0500 12    the passions in this case, and strengthen our rational
G56 0510  8    side; and poetry, with all its emphasis on the passions,
G56 0520  6    encourages the audience to give way to emotion. For
G56 0530  3    this reason, then, poetry tends to weaken the power
G56 0530 12    of control, the reason, because it tempts one to indulge
G56 0540 10    his passions, and even the best of men, he maintains,
G56 0550  8    may be corrupted by this subtle influence.
G56 0560  2       Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something
G56 0570  1    of an enigma, because he is so completely sensitive
G56 0570 10    to its charm. His whole objection, indeed, seems to
G56 0580  7    rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have
G56 0590  6    great power to influence, but Plato seldom pays any
G56 0600  3    attention to what might be called the poem itself.
G56 0600 12    He is, rather, concerned with the effect on society
G56 0610  8    and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice.
G56 0620  7    He wants them to use their great power to strengthen
G56 0630  3    man's rational side, to teach virtue, and to encourage
G56 0640  1    religion.
G56 0640  2       While Plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns
G56 0650  1    to the gods and famous men, still he clearly leaves
G56 0650 11    the way open for further discussion of the issue. He
G56 0660  7    even calls upon the poets to defend the Muse and to
G56 0670  5    show that poetry may contribute to virtue. He says:
G56 0675  1    "
G56 0675  1       We may further grant to those of her [Poetry's]
G56 0680  9    defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets,
G56 0690 10    the permission to speak in prose on her behalf: let
G56 0700  8    them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful
G56 0710  4    to States and to human life, and we will listen in
G56 0720  2    a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall
G56 0720 13    surely be the gainers- I mean, if there is a use in
G56 0730  9    poetry as well as a delight".
G56 0740  1       When we turn to Aristotle's ideas on the moral measure
G56 0750  1    of literature, it is at once apparent that he is at
G56 0750 12    times equally concerned about the influence of the
G56 0760  6    art. In the ideal state, for instance, he argues that
G56 0770  4    the young citizens should hear only the most carefully
G56 0780  1    selected tales and stories. For this reason, he would
G56 0780 10    banish indecent pictures and speeches from the stage;
G56 0790  7    and the young people should not even be permitted to
G56 0800  6    see comedies till they are old enough to drink strong
G56 0810  3    wine and sit at the public tables. By the time they
G56 0810 14    reach that age, however, Aristotle no longer worries
G56 0820  8    about the evil influence of comedies.
G56 0830  3       In Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the Poetics,
G56 0840  2    we find an attempt to isolate the art, to consider
G56 0840 12    only those things proper to it, to discover how it
G56 0850 10    differs from other arts, and to deal with the effects
G56 0860  7    peculiar to it. He assures us, early in the Poetics,
G56 0870  4    that all art is "imitation" and that all imitation
G56 0880  1    gives pleasure, but he distinguishes between art in
G56 0880  9    general and poetic art on the basis of the means, manner,
G56 0890 10    and the objects of the imitation. Once the poetic arts
G56 0900  6    are separated from the other forms, he lays down his
G56 0910  5    famous definition of tragedy, which sets up standards
G56 0920  1    and so lends direction to the remainder of the work.
G56 0920 11    A tragedy, by his definition, is an imitation of an
G56 0930  8    action that is serious, of a certain magnitude, and
G56 0940  3    complete in itself. It should have a dramatic form
G56 0950  1    with pleasing language, and it should portray incidents
G56 0950  9    which so arouse pity and fear that it purges these
G56 0960  8    emotions in the audience. Any tragedy, he maintains,
G56 0970  4    has six elements: plot, character, and thought (the
G56 0980  2    objects of imitation), diction and melody (the means
G56 0980 10    of imitation), and spectacle (the manner of imitation).
G56 0990  7    Throughout the rest of the Poetics, Aristotle continues
G56 1000  5    to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and
G56 1010  3    their interrelationship, and he refers frequently to
G56 1010 10    the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.
G56 1020  8       Aristotle's method in the Poetics, then, does suggest
G56 1030  8    that we should isolate the work. The Chicago contingent
G56 1040  6    of modern critics follow Aristotle so far in this direction
G56 1050  6    that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem
G56 1060  3    with another for the purpose of evaluation. But there
G56 1060 12    are, however, several features of Aristotle's approach
G56 1070  7    which open the way for the moral measure of literature.
G56 1080  8    For one thing, Aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt
G56 1090  5    the audience. In addition, his definition of a tragedy
G56 1100  4    invites our attention, because a serious and important
G56 1110  1    action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber
G56 1110 12    of the author or of the characters. And there is one
G56 1120  9    other point in the poetics that invites moral evaluation:
G56 1130  4    Aristotle's notion that the distinctive function of
G56 1140  3    tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity
G56 1150  1    and fear. He rejects certain plots because they do
G56 1150 10    not contribute to that end. The point is that an ethical
G56 1160  9    critic, with an assist from Freud, can seize on this
G56 1170  5    theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless
G56 1180  3    outlet for our hostile urges. In his study Samuel Johnson,
G56 1190  1    Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that
G56 1190 11    what Aristotle really means by his theory of catharsis
G56 1200  8    is that our evil passions may be so purged by the dramatic
G56 1210  8    ritual that it is "less likely that we shall indulge
G56 1220  5    them through our own acts". In Krutch's view, this
G56 1230  2    is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect
G56 1230 14    without employing the explicit methods of a moralist.
G56 1240  8    And we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation
G56 1250  5    is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will
G56 1260  5    encourage our passions. If Krutch is correct, tragedy
G56 1270  2    may have quite the opposite effect. It may allay our
G56 1270 12    passions and so restore the rule of reason. Or in more
G56 1280 11    Freudian terms, the experience may serve to sublimate
G56 1290  7    our destructive urges and strengthen the ego and superego.
G56 1300  5    #GOSSON AND SIDNEY#
G56 1300  8    The second half of the sixteenth century in England
G56 1310  6    was the setting for a violent and long controversy
G56 1320  2    over the moral quality of renaissance literature, especially
G56 1330  1    the drama. No one suggested that the ethical effects
G56 1330 10    of the art were irrelevant. Both sides agreed that
G56 1340  7    the theater must stand a moral test, but they could
G56 1350  5    not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad
G56 1360  3    influence. Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle
G56 1360 11    supported their cause. Those who wanted to close the
G56 1370  9    theaters, for example, pointed to Plato's Republic
G56 1380  5    and those who wished to keep them open called on the
G56 1390  5    Plato of the Ion to testify in their behalf.
G56 1400  1       The most famous document that comes out of this
G56 1400 10    dispute is perhaps Sir Philip Sidney's An Apologie
G56 1410  6    for Poetrie, published in 1595. Many students of literature
G56 1420  7    know that classical defense. What is not so well known,
G56 1430  7    however, and what is quite important for understanding
G56 1440  2    the issues of this early quarrel, is the kind of attack
G56 1450  1    on literature that Sidney was answering. For this reason,
G56 1450 10    then I want to describe, first, two examples of the
G56 1460  8    puritanical attacks: Stephen Gosson's The School of
G56 1470  5    Abuse, 1579, and his later Playes Confuted, published
G56 1480  3    in 1582. Second, we will see how Sidney answered the
G56 1490  3    charges, for while Sidney's essay was not specifically
G56 1500  1    a reply to Gosson, his arguments do support the new
G56 1500 11    theater.
G56 1510  1       According to William Ringler's study, Stephen Gosson,
G56 1510  8    the theater business in London had become a thriving
G56 1520  8    enterprise by 1577, and, in the opinion of many, a
G56 1530  7    thoroughly bad business. Aroused by what they considered
G56 1540  3    an evil influence, some members of the clergy, joined
G56 1550  1    by city authorities, merchants, and master craftsmen,
G56 1550  8    began the attack on the plays and the actors for what
G56 1560  9    they called "the abuses of the art", but by 1582 some
G56 1570  6    of them began to denounce the whole idea of acting.
G56 1580  2    Although this kind of wholesale objection came at first
G56 1580 11    from some men who were not technically Puritans, still,
G56 1590  9    once the Puritans gained power, they climaxed the affair
G56 1600  7    by passing the infamous ordinance of 1642 which decreed
G56 1610  5    that all "public stage-plays shall cease and be forborne".
G56 1620  4    With that act of Parliament the opponents of the stage
G56 1630  2    won the day, and for more than two decades after that
G56 1630 13    England had no legitimate public drama.
G56 1640  6       In the early days of this controversy over the theater
G56 1650  4    one of the interested parties, Stephen Gosson, published
G56 1660  2    a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses
G56 1670  1    of art, rather than the art itself. But his opposition
G56 1670 11    hardened and by 1579, in The School of Abuse, he was
G56 1680 10    ready to banish all "players". He advises women to
G56 1690  5    beware "of those places which in sorrows cheere you
G56 1700  3    and beguile you in mirth". He does not really approve
G56 1710  1    of levity and laughter, but sex is the deadly sin.
G56 1710 11    He warns that a single glance can lead us into temptation,
G56 1720  9    for "Looking eies have lyking hartes, and lyking hartes
G56 1730  6    may burne in lust".
