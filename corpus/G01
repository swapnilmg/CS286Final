G01 0010  1       NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil
G01 0010  9    rights and of integration. They have also led the nation
G01 0020 10    in the direction of a welfare state. And both in their
G01 0030  9    objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress
G01 0040  5    they have had ranged against them the Southerners who
G01 0050  2    are called Bourbons. The name presumably derives from
G01 0050 10    the French royal house which never learned and never
G01 0060  9    forgot; since Bourbon whiskey, though of Kentucky origin,
G01 0070  6    is at least as much favored by liberals in the North
G01 0080  6    as by conservatives in the South.
G01 0080 12       The nature of the opposition between liberals and
G01 0090  8    Bourbons is too little understood in the North. The
G01 0100  6    race problem has tended to obscure other, less emotional,
G01 0110  3    issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.
G01 0120  1    It is these other differences between North and South-
G01 0120 10    other, that is, than those which concern discrimination
G01 0130  8    or social welfare- which I chiefly discuss herein.
G01 0140  8       I write about Northern liberals from considerable
G01 0150  3    personal experience. A Southerner married to a New
G01 0160  3    Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut
G01 0160 13    commuting town with a high percentage of artists, writers,
G01 0170  9    publicity men, and business executives of egghead tastes.
G01 0180  7    Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider
G01 0190  5    themselves, and are viewed as, liberals. This is puzzling
G01 0200  3    to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of
G01 0210  1    liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats
G01 0210  9    who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the
G01 0220  7    liberal Jefferson, who held that the best government
G01 0230  4    was the least government. Yet paradoxically my liberal
G01 0250  1    friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their
G01 0250 10    patron saints. When I question them as to what they
G01 0260  9    mean by concepts like liberty and democracy, I find
G01 0270  4    that they fall into two categories: the simpler ones
G01 0280  2    who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith
G01 0280 11    without analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones
G01 0290  7    who scornfully reply that these things don't count
G01 0300  5    any more in the world of to-day. I am naive, they say,
G01 0310  3    to make use of such words.
G01 0310  9       I take this to mean that the intelligent- and therefore
G01 0320  6    necessarily cynical?- liberal considers that the need
G01 0330  5    for a national economy with controls that will assure
G01 0340  2    his conception of social justice is so great that individual
G01 0350  1    and local liberties as well as democratic processes
G01 0350  9    may have to yield before it. This seems like an attitude
G01 0360  8    favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which,
G01 0370  3    under a President of the same stamp, would try to coerce
G01 0380  3    an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court. As for
G01 0380 11    states' rights, they have never counted in the thinking
G01 0390  9    of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor
G01 0400  7    and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms.
G01 0410  5       The American liberal may, in the world of to-day,
G01 0420  4    have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so
G01 0420 14    enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.
G01 0430 10    Why, in the first place, call himself a liberal if
G01 0440  6    he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian
G01 0450  3    central government with womb-to-tomb controls over
G01 0460  1    everybody? If he attaches little importance to personal
G01 0460  9    liberty, why not make this known to the world? And
G01 0470 10    if he is so scornful of the rights of states, why not
G01 0480  7    advocate a different sort of constitution that he could
G01 0490  4    more sincerely support?
G01 0490  7       I am concerned here, however, with the Northern
G01 0500  5    liberal's attitude toward the South. It appears to
G01 0510  3    be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort
G01 0520  1    to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends.
G01 0520 10    His assumption seems to be that any such friends, being
G01 0530  9    tolerable humans, must be more liberal than most Southerners
G01 0540  5    and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his
G01 0550  3    views. Time's editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book,
G01 0560  1    The Waist-High Culture, wrote: "... most of what was
G01 0570  1    different about it (the Deep South) I found myself
G01 0570 10    unsympathetic to ...". This, for the liberals I know,
G01 0580  8    would be an understatement. Theirs is no mere lack
G01 0590  6    of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate
G01 0600  1    hatred that was directed against Fascism.
G01 0600  7       I do not think that my experience would be typical
G01 0610  7    for Southerners living in the North. In business circles,
G01 0620  5    usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere would
G01 0630  2    hardly be found. But in our case- and neither my wife
G01 0630 13    nor I have extreme views on integration, nor are we
G01 0640 10    given to emotional outbursts- the situation has ruined
G01 0650  5    one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking
G01 0660  5    several more. In fact it has caused us to give serious
G01 0670  2    thought to moving our residence south, because it is
G01 0670 11    not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly
G01 0680  9    by when his host is telling a roomful of people that
G01 0690  8    the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration
G01 0700  4    is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down.
G01 0710  2       Accounts have been published of Northern liberals
G01 0710  9    in the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially
G01 0720  8    in state-supported universities where pressure may
G01 0730  5    be strong to uphold the majority view. But these accounts
G01 0740  5    do not show that Northerners have been subjected to
G01 0750  2    embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed
G01 0750  9    in social gatherings. From my wife's experience and
G01 0760  8    other sources, this seems to be rarely encountered
G01 0770  6    in educated circles. The strong feeling is certainly
G01 0780  3    there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among
G01 0790  1    college graduates throughout the South, especially
G01 0790  7    among those who studied in the North. And social relations
G01 0800  8    arising out of business ties impose courtesy, if not
G01 0810  6    sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners.
G01 0820  1    Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire
G01 0820 10    the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.
G01 0830  8       There are of course many Souths; but for this discussion
G01 0840 10    the most important division is between those who have
G01 0850  7    been reconstructed and those who haven't. My definition
G01 0860  4    of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed
G01 0870  1    rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War.
G01 0870 13    Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this
G01 0880  9    category. I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed
G01 0890  7    ones than the North likes to believe. I never heard
G01 0900  5    of a poll being taken on the question. No doubt such
G01 0910  2    a thing would be considered unpatriotic. Prior to 1954
G01 0910 11    I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have
G01 0920  8    voted against the Confederacy. Since the Supreme Court's
G01 0930  5    decision of that year this is more doubtful; and if
G01 0940  5    a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch
G01 0950  3    of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would
G01 0960  1    have been for the Old South.
G01 0960  7       Belief in the traditional way of life persists much
G01 0970  4    more in the older states than in the new ones. Probably
G01 0980  1    a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians
G01 0980  9    remain unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia,
G01 0990  6    North Carolina, and Alabama following along after them.
G01 1000  6    Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater
G01 1010  4    than the Piedmont; so that a line running down the
G01 1020  3    length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater
G01 1030  1    would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but
G01 1030 11    with, of course, important minority enclaves.
G01 1040  4       The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and
G01 1050  4    South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to
G01 1060  2    its richest flowering, and there the memory is more
G01 1060 11    precious, and the consciousness of loss the greater.
G01 1070  7    Also, we should not even to-day discount the fact that
G01 1080  5    a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on
G01 1090  2    Charleston had closer ties with England and the West
G01 1090 11    Indies than with the North even after independence.
G01 1100  8    The social and psychological consequences of this continue
G01 1110  5    to affect the area. In certain respects defeat increased
G01 1120  4    the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South. Poor where
G01 1130  3    they had once been rich, humbled where they had been
G01 1140  1    arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the
G01 1140 11    leadership of the nation, the rebels who would not
G01 1150  7    surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy
G01 1160  3    they felt extended to them by the mother country. And
G01 1170  1    no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and
G01 1170 11    Georgia, which were among the most Tory in sentiment
G01 1180  8    in the eighteenth century, bitterly regretted the revolt
G01 1190  4    against the Crown.
G01 1190  7       Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to
G01 1200  8    do with their remaining unreconstructed than other
G01 1210  3    factors. All Southerners agree that slavery had to
G01 1220  1    go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern
G01 1220 10    meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia
G01 1230  9    years before it did. Southern resentment has been over
G01 1240  5    the method of its ending, the invasion, and Reconstruction;
G01 1250  3    their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political
G01 1260  2    control in many counties. But apart from racial problems,
G01 1270  1    the old unreconstructed South- to use the moderate
G01 1270  9    words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith- finds itself
G01 1280  6    unsympathetic to most of what is different about the
G01 1290  5    civilization of the North. And this, in effect, means
G01 1300  2    most of modern America.
G01 1300  6       It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise.
G01 1310  5    And therein, I feel, many Northerners delude themselves
G01 1320  3    about the South. For one thing, this is not a subject
G01 1330  1    often discussed or analyzed. There seems to be almost
G01 1330 10    a conspiracy of silence veiling it. I suppose the reason
G01 1340  9    is a kind of wishful thinking: don't talk about the
G01 1350  6    final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care
G01 1360  5    of themselves. Or else the North really believes that
G01 1370  2    all Southerners except a few quaint old characters
G01 1370 10    have come around to realizing the errors of their past,
G01 1380  9    and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream,
G01 1390  5    like everybody else.
G01 1390  8       If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not
G01 1400  7    reasonable to expect this to be true. The situation
G01 1410  4    of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western
G01 1420  1    world. Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population
G01 1420  9    and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War-I great
G01 1430  9    power have been, following conquest, ruled against
G01 1440  3    their will by a neighboring people, and have had imposed
G01 1450  2    upon them social and economic controls they dislike.
G01 1450 10    And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon
G01 1460 10    or Celtic descent. This is the only case in modern
G01 1470  8    history of a people of Britannic origin submitting
G01 1480  3    without continued struggle to what they view as foreign
G01 1490  1    domination. The fact is due mainly to international
G01 1490  9    wars, both hot and cold. In every war of the United
G01 1500  9    States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent
G01 1510  6    than the rest of the country. So instead of being tests
G01 1520  4    of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the two World
G01 1530  3    Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old
G01 1530 13    grievances and cement reunion. And there is no section
G01 1540  9    of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold
G01 1550  8    war against Communism. Had the situation been reversed,
G01 1560  4    had, for instance, England been the enemy in 1898 because
G01 1570  3    of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there
G01 1570 12    is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would
G01 1580  9    have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms
G01 1590  6    to fight as allies of Britain. It is extraordinary
G01 1600  3    that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should
G01 1610  2    have been as docile as they have. The North should
G01 1610 12    thank its stars that such has been the case; but at
G01 1620 10    the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom.
G01 1630  5       The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons
G01 1640  4    by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries.
G01 1650  2    There is much truth in both these charges, and not
G01 1660  1    many Bourbons deny them. Whatever their faults, they
G01 1660  9    are not hypocrites. Most of them sincerely believe
G01 1670  6    that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world
G01 1680  5    and that it should remain pure. Many Northeners believe
G01 1690  2    this, too, but few of them will say so publicly. The
G01 1690 13    Bourbon economic philosophy, moreover, is not very
G01 1700  7    different from that of Northern conservatives. But
G01 1710  3    those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed
G01 1720  1    go much further than this. They believe that if the
G01 1720 11    South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization
G01 1730 11    superior to that of modern America. As it is, they
G01 1740  8    consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of
G01 1750  5    excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high standard
G01 1760  2    of living the "American way" has been proved inferior
G01 1770  1    to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they
G01 1770  9    disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter.
G01 1780  6       The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes
G01 1790  5    such charges as poor manners, harsh accents, lack of
G01 1800  4    appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy
G01 1810  1    and the use of leisure. Their own easier, slower tempo
G01 1810 11    is especially dear to Southerners; and I have heard
G01 1820  8    many say that they are content to earn a half or a
G01 1830  7    third as much as they could up North because they so
G01 1840  3    much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.
