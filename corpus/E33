E33 0010  1       SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded
E33 0010 11    hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the
E33 0020 10    Hudson River there is a new home development called
E33 0030  7    "Oakwood Heights". As a matter of fact you could probably
E33 0040  6    find a new home development in every populated county
E33 0050  2    in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages
E33 0060  1    in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique
E33 0060 10    in one particular ... its oil for heating is metered
E33 0070  8    monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central
E33 0080  6    storage point.
E33 0080  8       This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity
E33 0090  6    chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation,
E33 0100  3    with principal offices in New York State. Its president
E33 0110  3    is Otis M. Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen
E33 0120  1    + Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg., New York City. Vice-president
E33 0130  1    is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark
E33 0130 10    Ritter. Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and
E33 0140  9    president of Kahler-Craft Distributors, Inc., Newburgh,
E33 0150  4    N.Y.
E33 0150  5       The idea of a central tank with lines to each house
E33 0160 10    is not in itself a novelty. Not a year goes by but
E33 0170  7    what several local companies in the U. S. and Canada,
E33 0180  3    even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire
E33 0190  1    if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors
E33 0190 12    only knew of one example to point to, a public housing
E33 0200 11    development of 278 homes in New Haven described by
E33 0210  7    John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue. This has survived
E33 0220  4    the years but there has been considerable concern among
E33 0230  2    the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.
E33 0230 13    Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and
E33 0240  8    charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons
E33 0250  7    in the family.
E33 0250 10       Common complaints included "Mrs. Murphy" leaving
E33 0260  5    her windows open all the time, a fresh air fan, or
E33 0270  6    the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with the house
E33 0280  3    shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil.
E33 0280 14    As a result of that attitude, others have been discouraged
E33 0290  9    from trying central distribution.
E33 0300  2       A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks
E33 0310  1    the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo"
E33 0310 10    meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries
E33 0320 11    of Los Angeles, a key individual being Don Nelson.
E33 0330  7    Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for
E33 0340  5    the northern, principal heating states.
E33 0350  1       There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State
E33 0350 11    headed by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development
E33 0360  9    was public housing, so it easily leaped over the problems
E33 0370  8    met in a private venture. These have to do with property
E33 0380  6    rights, municipal official attitudes and a host of
E33 0390  4    others. In working out the practical legal conclusions
E33 0390 12    President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot
E33 0400  9    project, for it is planned to duplicate this program
E33 0410  6    or system in other builder developments nationally.
E33 0420  2       It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming,
E33 0430  1    to get approval of any kind of line under a public
E33 0430 12    street, as one example. To overcome this, the builder
E33 0440  7    lays and completes the street himself, then deeds it
E33 0450  5    to the community while retaining a perpetual easement
E33 0460  2    for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title
E33 0460 14    is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For
E33 0470  9    the central storage, Tri-State buys one acre, Buries
E33 0480  7    its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that
E33 0490  4    piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline
E33 0500  1    system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the
E33 0500 11    town but rather to Tri-State.
E33 0510  4       How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan?
E33 0520  2    It leases the whole facility to a large oil company,
E33 0520 12    at least large enough to have a strong credit position.
E33 0530  9    This first test is being leased for ten years but future
E33 0540  8    projects will require at least 15 years. The amount
E33 0550  5    paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of
E33 0560  2    its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying
E33 0560 11    all the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally
E33 0570  9    must be profitable to both parties.
E33 0580  4       On this first venture the central storage is 20,000
E33 0590  2    gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons
E33 0590 12    for each of the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at
E33 0600  8    his convenience in transport loads, so as to maintain
E33 0610  6    two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies.
E33 0620  2    However, that is not all he has to do. He must undertake
E33 0630  2    complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure
E33 0630 10    fine heating. In the present project the heating is
E33 0640  9    by circulating hot water form Paragon boiler-burner
E33 0650  5    units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups.
E33 0660  3    Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals
E33 0670  1    as he finds best.
E33 0670  5       For this first development the supplier signing
E33 0680  2    the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal
E33 0680 14    is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil
E33 0690  8    distributor. The major gets the assured gallonage for
E33 0700  6    the life of the lease and the distributor apparently
E33 0710  2    can do well because delivery cost is low.
E33 0710 10    #INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS#
E33 0720  2    The officers of the new corporation have naturally
E33 0730  1    explored many angles, as well as personalities that
E33 0730  9    might be affected. For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie
E33 0740  7    town (township) where the project is located think
E33 0750  5    highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing
E33 0760  2    problem. The central storage is near a main artery
E33 0760 11    quite easy to reach with large transports on a short
E33 0770 10    crescent swing, with fewer trucks in the residential
E33 0780  5    streets.
E33 0780  6       The Public Service Commission has ruled that this
E33 0790  5    is not a public utility, subject to their many regulations.
E33 0810  3       Several financial institutions, both banks and insurance
E33 0820  3    companies, have been sounded out. They like it and
E33 0820 12    would supply most of the capital because of the long
E33 0830 10    term leases by strong oil companies.
E33 0840  3       The Government housing agencies consider it feasible
E33 0850  2    with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction
E33 0850 11    in the deed to provide that the customer may not be
E33 0860 11    charged more than the current market price for the
E33 0870  6    oil ... an obvious precaution, since the account is
E33 0880  3    permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.
E33 0890  1       For a few details of the system ... the lines are
E33 0890 12    1-1/4'' X-Tru-Coat, a product of Republic Steel Corp.,
E33 0900 10    and all lines are welded. They are laid a minimum of
E33 0910  9    24'' deep and in some areas four feet down, particularly
E33 0920  6    under roads, to stay clear of all other piping such
E33 0930  4    as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy
E33 0940  1    trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement
E33 0940 10    wall. Its figures are a half inch high and very easy
E33 0950  9    to read, even into tenth gallons. It will accommodate
E33 0960  4    firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.
E33 0970  1       Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total
E33 0970  9    cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution
E33 0980  7    system is no greater than would be gas heating systems
E33 0990  6    in the houses plus their lines and meters. He believes
E33 1000  3    that this is a sound approach to gas competition in
E33 1000 13    builder developments where gas is available.
E33 1010  6       It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State
E33 1020  7    system in old neighborhoods, and that's an understatement.
E33 1030  3    The job of getting property easements and street easements
E33 1040  2    and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.
E33 1050  1    But in a new development where everything starts from
E33 1050 10    scratch the solutions are simple.
E33 1060  5    #FUTURE PLANS#
E33 1060  7    What does Tri-State actually want to do, now that it
E33 1070  7    has the meters under franchise and certain phases of
E33 1080  3    its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage?
E33 1090  1    It wants to interest builders and oil companies in
E33 1090 10    the idea of including its facility in their new home
E33 1100  7    projects, by financing and installing the storage,
E33 1110  3    piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years,
E33 1120  1    with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may
E33 1120 11    also work in one other way- by licensing its system
E33 1130  7    patents and supplying the meters, letting the oil company
E33 1140  5    or even the builder install the facilities.
E33 1150  1       This whole development is certain to be of interest
E33 1150 10    to the readers, for the idea has so often been mentioned,
E33 1160  9    somewhat wistfully. But it's too early yet to go visit
E33 1170  9    Oakwood Heights. Only eight of the 50 houses were completed
E33 1180  6    at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th; others
E33 1190  4    were building. The big tanks were at the site but still
E33 1200  2    sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running
E33 1200 10    the trenches, and the town building inspector was paying
E33 1210  8    a friendly, if curious, visit.
E33 1220  2       The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a
E33 1220 11    revival of research and development. A primary ingredient
E33 1230  8    in these fields is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline
E33 1240  7    Corporation deserves a very good mark.
E33 1260  1       EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your
E33 1260  9    Cooling System week rolls around. It pays in the long
E33 1270 10    (hot) run to take good care of the water works. Do
E33 1280  7    it this way for the summer gargle:
E33 1290  1       @ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.
E33 1290 11    Don't save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive
E33 1300 10    "permanent" type. The word means it won't boil away
E33 1310  8    easily, nothing else. The rust inhibitors in the fluid
E33 1320  5    are used up after one year, and you don't want to risk
E33 1330  3    the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.
E33 1340  1       @ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good
E33 1340 14    flushing cleaner.
E33 1350  1       @ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor.
E33 1350 11    Of course, you'll want to use the softest water you
E33 1360 10    can in your radiators.
E33 1370  1       @ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections,
E33 1380  1    around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals
E33 1380 10    and heater fittings.
E33 1390  2       @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the
E33 1390 14    thermostat opens, and then look for leaks again. Be
E33 1400  9    sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator
E33 1410  8    fins. Use the air hose for this job. Check the temperature
E33 1420  4    gage and be sure it is working.
E33 1420 11       If you use one of the new year-round cooling system
E33 1430 10    fluids such as "Dowguard" be sure to check it. Dow
E33 1440  7    says that the fluid can be used now for two years.
E33 1450  4    Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it
E33 1450 11    in during the summer.
E33 1460  4       Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid those
E33 1470  2    unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature
E33 1470 10    zooms this summer.
E33 1480  3       Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out
E33 1490  2    of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs
E33 1490 10    of yours. Spring and summer may be here officially,
E33 1500  8    but those thermos stay in.
E33 1510  2       The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat
E33 1510 12    from any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase
E33 1520  8    the fuel consumption, reduce power and contribute to
E33 1530  6    spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive
E33 1540  3    carbon deposits on the insulators.
E33 1540  8       If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck,
E33 1550  9    check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat. The
E33 1560  5    thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating
E33 1570  3    temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its
E33 1570 12    most efficient temperature through the proper circulation
E33 1580  7    of the coolant.
E33 1590  1       Are you paying too much for your truck insurance?
E33 1590 10    There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage,
E33 1600 10    not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting
E33 1610  7    some corners that can be cut.
E33 1620  1       Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful
E33 1620 10    that you keep adequate coverage, but look for places
E33 1630  7    to save money. First go over the type of coverage you
E33 1640  5    now have. Look for these features which may mean you
E33 1650  2    can save:
E33 1650  4       @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up on the same
E33 1660  4    item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for
E33 1660 14    medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health
E33 1670 11    and accident policy.
E33 1680  1       @ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means
E33 1680 12    that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than
E33 1690 11    30 days, insurance can be suspended and a proportionate
E33 1700  7    return of your premium made to you. This applies to
E33 1710  5    repair work or winter storage.
E33 1710 10       The figure five is important in insurance. With
E33 1720  7    many company policies you get a fleet discount if you
E33 1730  6    insure five or more rigs. This means either cars or
E33 1740  2    trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.
E33 1740 10       Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying
E33 1750  7    deductibles to your liability plan. For example: If
E33 1760  5    your bodily injury claims start payment after the first
E33 1770  3    $250, a 25% premium saving is often made.
