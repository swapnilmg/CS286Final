J56 0010  1    The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south
J56 0010 11    of the location of the former electric light plant.
J56 0020  7       The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares
J56 0030  6    of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in
J56 0040  5    that locality, and assessments were made for its maintenance.
J56 0050  1    It has given considerable trouble at times and empties
J56 0050 10    right into the Battenkill. Fire District No. 1 discussed
J56 0060  9    its possible purchase in 1945, but considered it an
J56 0070  8    unwise investment.
J56 0070 10       The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when
J56 0080  8    there were only a few houses on the street. as new
J56 0090  6    homes were built they were connected so that all residences
J56 0100  3    south of School Street are served by it. B. J. Connell
J56 0110  2    is the present treasurer and manager.
J56 0110  8       The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen
J56 0120  7    appoint a committee to investigate and report on the
J56 0130  5    feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a
J56 0140  2    disposal plant to serve Manchester Center, Depot, and
J56 0140 10    Way's Lane. The committee submitted a report signed
J56 0150  8    by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published
J56 0160  7    in the 1946 town report. The layout of the sewer lines
J56 0170  5    was designed by Henry W. Taylor, who was the engineer
J56 0180  2    for the Manchester Village disposal plant. No figures
J56 0180 10    were submitted with the report and no action was taken
J56 0190 10    on it by the town.
J56 0200  1       The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities
J56 0200  8    to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct
J56 0210  8    a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with
J56 0220  4    its attendant facilities. The final step was a vote
J56 0230  1    for a $230,000 bond issue for the construction of a
J56 0230 11    sewage system by the 1959 town meeting, later confirmed
J56 0240  7    by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June
J56 0250  4    21, 1960.
J56 0250  6       There the matter stands with the prospect that soon
J56 0260  5    Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns
J56 0270  2    contributing raw sewage to its main streams.
J56 0270  9    #@ TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH#
J56 0280  2    MANCHESTER'S unusual interest in telegraphy has often
J56 0290  2    been attributed to the fact that the Rev. J. D. Wickham,
J56 0300  1    headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary, was a personal
J56 0300 10    friend and correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F.
J56 0310  7    B. Morse. At any rate, Manchester did not lag far behind
J56 0320  8    the first commercial system which was set up in 1844
J56 0330  7    between Baltimore and Washington.
J56 0340  1       In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin, jeweler and watchmaker,
J56 0340  8    became the town's first telegrapher in a dwelling he
J56 0350  7    built for himself and his business "two doors north
J56 0360  4    of the Equinox House" or "one door north of the Bank,
J56 0370  4    Manchester, Vermont". Goodwin was telegrapher for the
J56 0380  2    "American Telegraph Company" and the "Troy and Canada
J56 0390  1    Junction Telegraph Company". Shares of capital stock
J56 0390  8    at $15 each in the latter company were payable at the
J56 0400  9    Bank of Manchester or at various other Vermont banks.
J56 0410  5    A message of less than fifteen words to Bennington
J56 0420  2    cost twenty-five cents.
J56 0420  6       By 1871 L. C. Orvis, manager of the "Western Union
J56 0430  6    Telegraph Company", expressed willingness to send emergency
J56 0440  5    telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore. Orvis
J56 0450  3    even needed to hire an assistant, Clark J. Wait. The
J56 0460  2    Manchester Journal commented editorially on the surprising
J56 0470  1    amount of local telegraphic business.
J56 0470  6       In the fall of 1878, the "Popular Telegraph Line"
J56 0480  5    was established between Manchester and Factory Point
J56 0490  4    by the owners, Paul W. Orvis, Henry Gray, J. N. Hard,
J56 0500  4    and Clark J. Wait. The line soon lived up to its name,
J56 0510  4    as local messages of moderate length could be sent
J56 0510 13    for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare
J56 0520 10    very liberal dividends on its capital stock.
J56 0530  5       In 1879 the same Clark Wait, with H. H. Holley of
J56 0540  4    South Dorset, formed the "American Telegraph Line",
J56 0550  2    extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and
J56 0560  1    South Dorset to Dorset. Besides being most convenient,
J56 0560  9    the line "soon proved a good investment for the owners".
J56 0570  8    Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron C.
J56 0580  8    Burr and Mark Manley of "Burr and Manley", dealers
J56 0590  4    in lumber and dry goods.
J56 0590  9       Early equipment was very flimsy; the smallest gusts
J56 0600  7    of wind toppled poles, making communications impossible.
J56 0610  4    But companies continued to spring up. By 1883 the "Battenkill
J56 0620  6    Telegraph Company" was in existence and Alvin Pettibone
J56 0630  4    was its president. Operating in 1887 was the "Valley
J56 0640  2    Telegraph Line", officers of which were E. C. Orvis,
J56 0650  1    president; H. K. Fowler, vice-president and secretary;
J56 0660  1    J. N. Hard, treasurer; F. H. Walker, superintendent;
J56 0670  1    H. S. Walker, assistant superintendent. Two companies
J56 0670  8    now had headquarters with Clark J. Wait, who by then
J56 0680  9    had his own drugstore at Factory Point- the "Northern
J56 0690  6    Union Telegraph Company" and the "Western Union". Operators
J56 0700  6    were Arthur Koop and Norman Taylor. Still existing
J56 0710  4    on a "Northern Union" telegraph form is a typical peremptory
J56 0720  5    message from Peru grocer J. J. Hapgood to Burton and
J56 0730  4    Graves' store in Manchester- "Get and send by stage
J56 0740  3    sure four pounds best Porterhouse or serloin stake,
J56 0740 11    for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges".
J56 0750  6       About 1888 J. E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E.
J56 0760  6    G. Bacon became proprietors of the "Green Mountain
J56 0770  5    Telegraph Company", connecting all offices on the Western
J56 0780  4    Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville
J56 0790  2    to Peru, Londonderry, South Londonderry, Lowell Lake,
J56 0800  1    Windham, North Windham, Grafton, Cambridgeport, Saxton's
J56 0810  1    River, and Bellows Falls.
J56 0810  5       From 1896 until 1910 John H. Whipple was manager
J56 0820  4    of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore he
J56 0830  2    purchased from Clark Wait. The Village office of Western
J56 0830 11    Union with George Towsley as manager and telegrapher
J56 0840  8    continued in Hard's drugstore until 1905. During the
J56 0850  6    summers, Towsley often needed the assistance of a company
J56 0860  6    operator.
J56 0860  7       These were the years when people flocked to Manchester
J56 0870  5    not only to play golf, which had come into vogue, but
J56 0880  4    also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments.
J56 0890  1    New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters
J56 0890 10    who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily
J56 0900  7    to the metropolitan newspapers. This boosted local
J56 0910  4    telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the
J56 0920  3    free advertising. In 1914 when the town was chosen
J56 0920 12    for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament, a representative
J56 0930  8    hurried here from the Boston manager's office. In his
J56 0940  7    wake came the District Traffic Supervisor and the cream
J56 0950  5    of the telegraphic profession, ten of Boston's best,
J56 0960  3    chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge
J56 0970  1    of golf. During that tournament alone, some 250,000
J56 0970  9    words winged their way out of Manchester.
J56 0980  6       The old Morse system was replaced locally by the
J56 0990  4    Simplex modern automatic method in 1929, when Ellamae
J56 1000  1    Heckman (Wilcox) was manager of the Western Union office.
J56 1000 10    During summers, business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox
J56 1010  9    had two assistants and a messenger. She was succeeded
J56 1020  7    by Clarence Goyette. Since that time the telegraph
J56 1030  5    office has shifted in location from the railroad station
J56 1040  2    at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town
J56 1040 14    clerk's office and drugstore at the Village. After
J56 1050  8    being located for some years in the Village at the
J56 1060  8    Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs. Harry
J56 1070  4    Mercier, it is presently located in the Hill and Dale
J56 1080  3    Shop, Manchester Center.
J56 1080  6       The first known telephone line in Manchester was
J56 1090  5    established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley's
J56 1100  2    store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and Root Marble
J56 1110  1    Company in South Dorset. This was extended the following
J56 1110 10    year to include the railroad station agent's office
J56 1120  8    and Thayer's Hotel at Factory Point. In November 1887
J56 1130  7    a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset
J56 1140  4    was extended to Manchester Depot. Telephone wires from
J56 1150  3    Louis Dufresne's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne
J56 1160  1    lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895. Eber
J56 1160 11    L. Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting
J56 1170  7    of phone poles in East Dorset and Barnumville in his
J56 1180  6    diary for 1906. These must have been for local calls
J56 1190  4    strictly, as in May 1900 the "only long distance telephone"
J56 1200  2    in town was transferred from C. B. Carleton's to Young's
J56 1210  2    shoe store.
J56 1210  4       A small single switchboard was installed in the
J56 1220  3    Village over Woodcock's hardware store (later E. H.
J56 1230  1    Hemenway's). George Woodcock was manager and troubleshooter;
J56 1240  1    Elizabeth Way was the first operator; and a night operator
J56 1240 11    was also employed. Anyone fortunate enough to have
J56 1250  7    one of those early phones advertised the fact along
J56 1260  5    with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal.
J56 1270  2       In 1918 the New England Telephone Company began
J56 1280  2    erecting a building to house its operations on the
J56 1280 11    corner of U. S. Rte. 7 and what is now Memorial Avenue
J56 1290 10    at Manchester Center. Service running through Barnumville
J56 1300  5    and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains
J56 1310  6    was in the hands of the "Gleason Telephone Company"
J56 1320  2    in 1925, but major supervision of telephone lines in
J56 1330  2    Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph
J56 1330 11    Company, which eventually gained all control. More
J56 1340  7    aerial and underground equipment was installed as well
J56 1350  6    as office improvements to take care of the expanding
J56 1360  4    business.
J56 1360  5       In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs, agent and chief operator,
J56 1370  5    who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service,
J56 1380  2    led agency offices in sales for the year with $2,490.
J56 1390  1    William Hitchcock, who retired in 1938, was a veteran
J56 1390 10    of thirty-four years' local service. Another veteran
J56 1400  6    telephone operator was Edith Fleming Blackmer, who
J56 1410  4    had been in the office forty years at the time of her
J56 1420  3    death in 1960.
J56 1420  6       In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange, which
J56 1430  2    made business easier for the Manchester office, but
J56 1430 10    it was not until February 1953 that area service was
J56 1440  9    extended to include Manchester and Dorset. This eliminated
J56 1450  5    toll calls between the two towns. Within a month, calls
J56 1460  5    were up seventy per cent.
J56 1460 10    #@ ELECTRIC POWER#
J56 1470  2    ELECTRICITY plays such an important part in community
J56 1470 10    life today that it is difficult to envision a time
J56 1480 10    when current was not available for daily use. Yet one
J56 1490  7    has to go back only some sixty years.
J56 1500  1       The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester
J56 1500 10    seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin's and Houghton's
J56 1510 10    gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point. No records
J56 1520 10    are available as to the date or extent of installation,
J56 1530  8    but it may have been in 1896.
J56 1540  1       On June 14, 1900 the Manchester Journal reported
J56 1540  9    that an electrical engineer was installing an electric
J56 1550  8    light plant for Edward S. Isham at "Ormsby Hill". This
J56 1560  7    was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory
J56 1570  6    service.
J56 1570  7       In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden
J56 1580  7    on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible
J56 1590  6    to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric
J56 1600  3    power plant. Nothing came of it, perhaps due to lack
J56 1600 13    of opportunity for water storage.
J56 1610  5       The next step was construction by the Manchester
J56 1620  4    Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank
J56 1630  2    of the Battenkill south of Union Street bridge. This
J56 1630 11    was nearly completed May 23, 1901 with a promise of
J56 1640  9    lights by June 10, but the first light did not go on
J56 1650  8    until September 28. It was at the end of the sidewalk
J56 1660  4    in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage.
J56 1670  1       The first directors of the Manchester Light and
J56 1670  8    Power Company were John Marsden, M. L. Manley, William
J56 1680  7    F. Orvis, George Smith, and John Blackmer. The officers
J56 1690  6    were John Marsden, president; John C. Blackmer, vice-president;
J56 1700  6    George Smith, treasurer; and William F. Orvis, secretary.
J56 1710  6    Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and
J56 1720  6    manager of its successor company, the Colonial Light
J56 1730  2    and Power Company, for one year.
J56 1730  8       At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting
J56 1740  6    under way, the Vail Light and Lumber Company started
J56 1750  4    construction of a chair stock factory on the site of
J56 1760  3    the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery, intending
J56 1760 10    to use its surplus power for generating electricity.
J56 1770  8    Manchester then had two competing power companies until
J56 1780  6    1904, when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased
J56 1790  5    the transmission system of the Vail Company. This was
J56 1800  4    fortunate, as the Vail plant burned in 1905.
J56 1810  1       The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded
J56 1810  9    by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation, which in
J56 1820  6    turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service
J56 1830  5    Corporation. The latter now furnishes the area with
J56 1840  4    electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at
J56 1850  1    Manchester Depot which was put into operation February
J56 1850  9    19, 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation
J56 1860  9    of larger transformers.
J56 1870  1       For a time following the abandonment of the local
J56 1870 10    plant, electric current for Manchester was brought
J56 1880  7    in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the
J56 1890  7    Vermont Marble Company system to the north.
