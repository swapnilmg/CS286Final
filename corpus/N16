N16 0010  1       Over the rattling of fenders, humming of tires and
N16 0010 10    chattering of gears there was a charming melody of
N16 0020  9    whispers and tiny giggles. Cool air moving slowly through
N16 0030  5    the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming
N16 0040  3    roadside vegetation, and occasionally a faint fragrance
N16 0050  1    of perfume swirled from the back seat.
N16 0050  8       "Moriarty", my driver suddenly exclaimed with something
N16 0060  5    so definite, so final in his tone I once more repeated
N16 0080  4    the absurdity, mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy
N16 0090  2    to sound convinced.
N16 0090  5       We were coming to an intersection, turning right,
N16 0100  3    chuffing to a stop.
N16 0100  7       Forced to realize that this was the end of a very
N16 0110  8    short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what
N16 0120  2    the end of a slightly longer line would be for the
N16 0120 13    old Mexican: Moriarty, New Mexico.
N16 0130  5       "Gracias. Adios", I said, exhausting my Spanish
N16 0140  5    vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped
N16 0150  5    store of smiles with my host's daughters. I waved with
N16 0160  3    discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces
N16 0160 11    fading through rising dust and the distortions of the
N16 0170  9    back window glass. Then I saw the father's head slightly
N16 0180  7    turn; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals
N16 0190  4    of gold.
N16 0190  6    ##
N16 0190  7    Autos whizzed past. White-shirted and conservatively-cravated
N16 0200  4    drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon
N16 0210  4    and past my supplicating and accusing gaze.
N16 0220  1       Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled,
N16 0220  9    and, thumbing hopefully, I saw emergent in windshield
N16 0230  6    flash: red lips, streaming silk of blonde hair and-
N16 0240  5    ah, trembling confusion of hope, apprehension, despair-
N16 0250  1    the leering face of old Herry.
N16 0250  7       "Mor-ee-air-teeeee", he shrieked, his white teeth
N16 0260  6    grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde.
N16 0270  4       Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat
N16 0280  4    piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was
N16 0280 12    just discernible, near, or enviably near that spot
N16 0290  8    where- hidden- more delicately-textured, most beautifully
N16 0300  5    tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool, oh
N16 0310  5    cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca
N16 0320  1    flowers and engine fumes.
N16 0320  5       Damn his luck. I would have foregone my romantic
N16 0330  3    chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty
N16 0340  1    and- Well, at least I wouldn't have shouted back a
N16 0340 10    taunt.
N16 0350  1       Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that
N16 0350 10    was slowly approaching, its pre-war chrome nearly blinding
N16 0360  8    me. It was stopping.
N16 0370  1       Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag, I
N16 0370 11    heard: "Sahjunt Yoorick, meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck".
N16 0380  8    The voice was that of Johnson, tail gunner off another
N16 0400  9    crew.
N16 0400 10       Squeezing a look between Johnson's fat jowls and
N16 0410  8    the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady
N16 0420  5    inquired "Y'all drahve"?
N16 0430  1       I nodded.
N16 0430  2       "Onleh one thiihng", Mrs. Roebuck continued. "Ahm
N16 0440  2    goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe, an y'all
N16 0440 12    maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt. But Corporal Johnson
N16 0450  8    has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im".
N16 0460  7       I said that it didn't make any difference to me
N16 0470  6    either, as far as I knew.
N16 0470 12       How far I knew will shortly become apparent. Let
N16 0480  8    me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of
N16 0490  5    the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck "wonduh if the
N16 0500  4    wahtahm speed limit" (35 m.p.h.) "is still in ee-faket".
N16 0510  4       I let up on the accelerator, only to gradually reach
N16 0520  2    again the 60 m.p.h. which would, I hoped, overhaul
N16 0520 11    Herry and the blonde, and as there were cars whose
N16 0530 10    drivers apparently had something more important to
N16 0540  5    catch than had I, Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to
N16 0550  4    practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles
N16 0560  1    she would need when making her duty call on Colonel
N16 0560 11    and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe.
N16 0570  4       When Johnson ejaculated "Howsabout my buying us
N16 0580  3    all a nice cold Co-cola, Ma'am"? Mrs. Roebuck smilingly
N16 0590  1    declined and began suddenly to go on about her son,
N16 0590 11    who was "onleh a little younguh than you bawhs".
N16 0600  7       Johnson never would have believed she had a son
N16 0610  7    that age. Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a "sweet
N16 0620  4    bawh t'lah lahk thet", but her Herman was getting to
N16 0630  2    be a man, there was no getting around it. "Just befoh
N16 0630 13    he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on
N16 0640 10    the vuhranduh, Major Roebuck an Ah, an Huhmun says
N16 0650  6    'May Ah hev one too'? just as p'lite an- an cohnfidunt,

N16 0680  4    Ah said 'Aw right, Ah gay-ess, an his fathuh didn uttuh

N16 0710  7    but just the same it was behahn mah back, an Ah doan
N16 0720  6    think thet's nahce at all, d'you"?
N16 0730  1       "No, I don't", Johnson said. "I'm a good Baptist,
N16 0740  1    and drinking ..."
N16 0740  4    ##
N16 0740  5    Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante
N16 0750  3    Fe to a road which would, she said, lead us to Taos
N16 0760  1    and then Raton and "eventshahleh" out of New Mexico.
N16 0760 10    How lightly her "eventshah-leh" passed into the crannies
N16 0770  8    where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely
N16 0780  6    dreamed opus, and how the word would echo. And re-echo.
N16 0790  6       Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty
N16 0800  5    pick-up truck, father or grandfather of Senor "Moriarty's"
N16 0810  2    Ford sedan, came screeching to a dust-swirling stop,
N16 0820  1    and a brown face appeared, its nose threatened by shards
N16 0820 11    of what had once been the side window.
N16 0830  7       "Get in, buddies. Get in". The straight, black hair
N16 0840  5    flopped in a vigorous nod, the slender nose plunged
N16 0850  2    toward glass teeth and drew safely back.
N16 0850  9       Johnson unwired the right hand door, whose window
N16 0860  7    was, like the left one, merely loosely-taped fragments
N16 0870  2    of glass, and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow
N16 0880  1    seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer.
N16 0880 11       "In back, buddy", the driver said to me.
N16 0890  8       Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over
N16 0900  6    the low side-rack, I stepped on the running board;
N16 0910  2    it flopped down, sprang back up and gouged my shin.
N16 0910 12    The truck was hurtling forward. I seized the rack and
N16 0920  9    made a western-style flying-mount just in time, one
N16 0930  7    of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag- and
N16 0940  2    merely wrecking my camera, I was to discover later-
N16 0950  1    my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards
N16 0950 11    and- but this is no medical report.
N16 0960  5       I was again in motion and at a speed which belied
N16 0970  3    the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle. Maybe
N16 0980  2    I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all. Whatever
N16 0980 12    satisfaction that might offer.
N16 0990  4       Something pulled my leg.
N16 1000  1       I drew back, drawing back my foot for a kick. But
N16 1000 11    it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken
N16 1010  6    fencing, which half covered the truck cab's glassless
N16 1020  3    rear window. The way his red rubber lips were stretched
N16 1030  1    across his pearly little teeth I though he was only
N16 1030 11    having a little joke, but, no, he wanted me to bend
N16 1040 10    down from the roar of wind so he could roar something
N16 1050  6    into my ear.
N16 1050  9       "Wanna beer"?
N16 1060  1       "Hell, yes", I roared back between dusty lips. Did
N16 1060 10    I want a beer? Did an anteater want ants?
N16 1070  9       "Bueno, amigo. Gracias", I hollered, my first long
N16 1080  7    swallow filling me with confidence and immediately
N16 1090  3    doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary.
N16 1100  1       At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I
N16 1100 13    took to be Spanish, but- the driver's white teeth flashing
N16 1110  6    at me, the road wildly veering beyond his glistening
N16 1120  5    hair, beyond his gesticulating bottle- it could have
N16 1140  1    been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing;
N16 1140 10    I wouldn't have known the difference.
N16 1150  6       Johnson was trying to grab the wheel, though the
N16 1160  6    swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it.
N16 1170  2    White teeth suddenly vanishing, the driver slammed
N16 1170  9    the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear.
N16 1180  6       We were off the road, gleaming barbed wire pulling
N16 1190  4    taut. I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere
N16 1200  2    down the line and came whipping over the sideboards.
N16 1200 11    We were in a field, in a tight, screeching turn. Prairie
N16 1210 11    dogs were popping up and popping down. When I fell
N16 1220  8    on my back, I saw a vulture hovering.
N16 1230  1       Just as I got to my knees, there was again the sound
N16 1240  1    of the fence stretching, and I had time only to start
N16 1240 12    taking my kneeling posture seriously. This time no
N16 1250  6    wire came whipping into the truck.
N16 1260  1       We were back on the road. I regained my squatting
N16 1260 11    position behind the truck cab's rear window. Johnson's
N16 1270  8    left hand was pressed against the side of his head,
N16 1280  7    red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers.
N16 1290  1       "Tee-wah", the driver cackled, his black eyes glittering
N16 1300  1    behind dull silver chicken fencing. "That was Tee-wah
N16 1300 10    I was talking. You thought I was a Mexican, didn't
N16 1310  9    you, buddy"?
N16 1320  1       I nodded.
N16 1320  3       "Hell, that's all right, buddy", the Indian (I now
N16 1330  3    guessed) said. "Drink your beer".
N16 1330  8       Miraculously, the bottle was still in my hand, foam
N16 1340  9    still geysering over my (luckily) waterproof watch.
N16 1350  3    No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started
N16 1360  2    zigzagging the truck. The beer foamed furiously. I
N16 1360 10    drank furiously. A long time. Emptied the bottle.
N16 1370  8       Teeth again flashing back at me, the driver released
N16 1380  7    a deluge of Spanish in which "amigo" appeared every
N16 1390  3    so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding
N16 1400  2    sound. I bobbed my head each time it appeared.
N16 1410  1       Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which
N16 1410  8    only one word emerged with clarity and precision, "son
N16 1420  6    of a bitch", sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of
N16 1430  5    a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs.
N16 1440  1       A big car was approaching, its chrome teeth grinning.
N16 1440 10    Beyond it the gray road stretched a long, long way.
N16 1450 10    The car was just about to us, its driver's fat, solemn
N16 1460  6    face intent on the road ahead, on business, on a family
N16 1470  4    in Sante Fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck in
N16 1480  2    which two human beings desperately needed rescue.
N16 1480  9       I tossed the bottle. High, so it would only bounce
N16 1490  9    harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof. Too
N16 1500  6    high. On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into
N16 1510  3    a small amber flash.
N16 1510  7       "Aye-yah-ah-ah"!
N16 1520  1       The Indian was again raising his bottle, but to
N16 1520 10    my astonished relief- probably only a fraction of Johnson's-
N16 1530  9    the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips.
N16 1540  6       Another car was coming, a tiny, dark shape on a
N16 1550  5    far hill. I started looking on the splintery truck
N16 1560  1    bed for a piece of board, a dirt clod- anything I could
N16 1560 13    throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer
N16 1570 10    bottle.
N16 1570 11       We were slowing. In the ditch sand was white and
N16 1580  8    soft-looking, only an occasional pebble discernible,
N16 1590  3    faintly gleaming. But Johnson couldn't quickly unwire
N16 1600  2    the truck door, and if I escaped, he might suffer.
N16 1610  1       The car was approaching fast. On the truck bed there
N16 1610 10    was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery;
N16 1620  7    with more time I could have loosened a small burr or
N16 1630  6    cotter pin-
N16 1630  8       Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of
N16 1640  6    the coins in my pocket. There was no time to pick out
N16 1650  3    a penny; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger,
N16 1650 14    leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner
N16 1660 10    on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile.
N16 1670  7       There was a blur just under my focus of vision,
N16 1680  5    a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned into
N16 1690  2    a silver web with a dark hole in the center.
N16 1690 12       I heard the screech of brakes behind me, an insane
N16 1700  9    burst of laughter beneath me. Looking back I saw a
N16 1710  6    gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying
N16 1720  3    to read our license number.
N16 1720  8       "S-s-sahjunt". Johnson's fat hand, another bottle
N16 1730  5    were protruding from the truck cab, and that self-proclaimed
N16 1740  5    Baptist teetotaler, had a bottle at his own lips.
N16 1750  2       Two cars came over a crest, their chrome and glass
N16 1750 12    flashing. The Indian's arm whipped sidewise- there
N16 1760  7    was a flash of amber and froth, the crash of the bottle
N16 1770  8    shattering against the side of the first car.
N16 1780  4       Brakes shrieked behind us. I saw Johnson's bottle
N16 1790  2    snatched from his hand, saw it go in a swirl of foam
N16 1790 14    just behind the second car. This time there was no
N16 1800  9    sound of brakes but the shrieking of women. I looked
N16 1810  5    back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of
N16 1820  3    the car's rear window.
N16 1820  7       "Drink, you son of a bitch"! I quickly turned around
N16 1830  5    and began to drink. But the Indian was jabbing another
N16 1840  3    bottle toward Johnson.
