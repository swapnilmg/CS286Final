J11 0010  1    Many other (probably nearly all) snakes at maturity
J11 0010  9    are already more than half their final length. Laurence
J11 0020  7    M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the
J11 0030  5    ultimate length for some rattlesnakes, and Charles
J11 0040  1    C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes
J11 0050  1    (Thamnophis) show that the smallest gravid females
J11 0050  8    are more than half as long as the biggest adults. Felix
J11 0060  9    Kopstein states that "when the snake reaches its maturity
J11 0070  6    it has already reached about its maximal length", but
J11 0080  3    goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception,
J11 0090  1    with maximum length approximately three times that
J11 0090  8    at maturity. It is hard to understand how he concluded
J11 0100  9    that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining
J11 0110  4    maturity; he was working with species of Java, so perhaps
J11 0120  5    some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect. Certain
J11 0130  2    individual giants recorded later did fail to show a
J11 0130 11    reasonable difference after maturity, but it is impossible
J11 0140  8    to know whether this is due to captive conditions.
J11 0150  6    Additional records of slow growth have been omitted.
J11 0160  3       It is possible to make a few generalizations about
J11 0170  1    the six giants themselves. There seems to be a rough
J11 0170 11    correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths,
J11 0180  7    starting with the smallest (boa constrictor) and ending
J11 0190  5    with the largest (anaconda). Data on the former are
J11 0200  3    scanty, but there can be little doubt that the latter
J11 0200 13    is sometimes born at a length greater than that of
J11 0210  9    any of the others, thereby lending support to the belief
J11 0220  6    that the anaconda does, indeed, attain the greatest
J11 0230  3    length. For four of the six (the anaconda and the amethystine
J11 0240  1    python cannot be included for lack of data) there is
J11 0240 11    also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum
J11 0250  7    length, the boa constrictor being the smallest and
J11 0260  5    the Indian python the next in size at the former stage.
J11 0270  3       Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of
J11 0280  2    the anaconda. If, in a certain part of the range, it
J11 0280 13    starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other
J11 0290  9    (relatively large) giants, and reaches maturity at,
J11 0300  3    let us guess, 18 inches longer than the others, a quadrupling
J11 0310  2    of the maturity length would result in a maximum of
J11 0310 12    (nearly) 40 feet.
J11 0320  3       When it comes to rate of early growth, the Indian
J11 0330  1    python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches
J11 0330 12    per year for the first two years, more or less. The
J11 0340  8    African rock python, a close second, is followed in
J11 0350  4    turn by the reticulate python. There are few data on
J11 0360  2    the boa constrictor, those for the anaconda are unconvincing,
J11 0360 11    and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python.
J11 0370 10    It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead
J11 0380  7    because records of its growth have been made more carefully
J11 0390  5    and frequently; it responds exceptionally well to captivity
J11 0400  4    and does not reach proportions that make it hard to
J11 0410  1    keep.
J11 0410  2       I cannot make sense out of the figures for post
J11 0410 12    maturity growth; at best the annual increase appears
J11 0420  8    to be a matter of inches rather than feet. Until better
J11 0430  6    records have been kept over longer periods of time
J11 0440  4    and much more is known about the maximum dimensions,
J11 0450  1    it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.
J11 0450 10       It is often stated that the largest snakes require
J11 0460  6    five years to attain maturity, but this apparently
J11 0470  3    is an overestimation. The best way to determine the
J11 0480  1    correct figure (in captives) is by direct observation
J11 0480  9    of pairs isolated from birth, a method that produced
J11 0490  7    surprising results: maturing of a male Indian python
J11 0500  5    in less than two years, his mate in less than three;
J11 0510  1    data on the boa constrictor about match this.
J11 0510  9       Another approach is to estimate from the rate of
J11 0520  8    growth and the smallest size at maturity. Results from
J11 0530  4    this approach amply confirm the direct observations:
J11 0540  1    about three years are required, there being a possible
J11 0540 10    slight difference between males and females in the
J11 0550  8    time required. Only the amethystine python and the
J11 0560  5    anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data.
J11 0570  3       The following information on snakes varying greatly
J11 0580  1    in size (but all with less than a 10-foot maximum)
J11 0580 12    shows, when considered with the foregoing, that there
J11 0590  6    is probably no correlation between the length of a
J11 0600  5    snake and the time required for it to mature. Oliver,
J11 0610  1    in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United
J11 0610 13    States, could supply data on the maturing period for
J11 0620  9    only three species in addition to the rattlers, which
J11 0630  5    I shall consider separately. These three were much
J11 0640  3    alike: lined snake (Tropidoclonion), one year and nine
J11 0650  2    months; red-bellied snake (Storeria), two years; cottonmouth
J11 0660  1    (Ancistrodon), two years. Klauber investigated the
J11 0660  7    rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized
J11 0670  6    what others have found. He concluded that in the southern
J11 0680  6    species, which are rapidly growing types, females mate
J11 0690  3    at the age of two and a half and bear the first young
J11 0700  1    when they are three. Other herpetologists have ascertained
J11 0700  9    that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake
J11 0710  8    may not give first birth until it is four or even five
J11 0720  9    years old, and that the young may be born every other
J11 0730  5    year, rather than annually. Carpenter's study showed
J11 0740  2    that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan
J11 0740 11    mature at about the age of two.
J11 0750  7    #MAXIMUM LENGTH#
J11 0750  9    Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive
J11 0760  6    or preserved, and field measurements are obviously
J11 0770  3    open to doubt because of the universal tendency to
J11 0770 12    exaggerate dimensions. Measurements of skins are of
J11 0780  7    little value; every snake hide is noticeably longer
J11 0790  6    than its carcass and intentional stretching presents
J11 0800  2    no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.
J11 0800  8       In spite of all the pitfalls, there is a certain
J11 0810 10    amount of agreement on some of the giants. The anaconda
J11 0820  7    proves to be the fly in the ointment, but the reason
J11 0830  4    for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions
J11 0840  1    still found in tropical South America might be responsible.
J11 0850  1       There are three levels on which to treat the subject.
J11 0850 11    The first is the strictly scientific, which demands
J11 0860  6    concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative
J11 0870  5    side by waiting for evidence in the flesh. This approach
J11 0880  2    rejects virtually all field measurements. The next
J11 0880  9    level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to
J11 0890  9    a balanced, sensible conclusion; field measurements
J11 0900  3    by experienced explorers are not rejected, and even
J11 0910  3    reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated.
J11 0920  1    The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke
J11 0920 13    means some fire. The argument against this last approach
J11 0930  7    is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop
J11 0940  5    snakes, about snakes that break themselves into many
J11 0950  3    pieces and join up again, or even of ghosts that chase
J11 0950 14    people out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony
J11 0960 10    does not prove, to the scientific mind, the existence
J11 0970  7    of hoop snakes, joint snakes, or ghosts.
J11 0980  3       Oliver has recently used the second-level approach
J11 0990  1    with the largest snakes, and has come to these conclusions:
J11 0990 11    the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet,
J11 1000  9    the reticulate python 33, the African rock python 25,
J11 1010  6    the amethystine python at least 22, the Indian python
J11 1020  2    20, and the boa constrictor 18-1/2.
J11 1020  9       Bernard Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes,
J11 1030  7    but on the third level, and is chiefly concerned with
J11 1040  5    the anaconda. He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet
J11 1050  3    long are often found, some might be 38, and occasional
J11 1050 13    "monstrous freaks" over 50. He rejects dimensions of
J11 1060  8    70 feet and more. His thirteenth chapter includes many
J11 1070  6    exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious
J11 1080  3    strength, but these seem to be given to complete his
J11 1090  1    picture, not to be believed.
J11 1090  6       Detailed information on record lengths of the giants
J11 1100  5    is given in the section that follows.
J11 1100 12    #GROWTH OF THE SIX GIANTS#
J11 1110  5    Discussions of the giants one by one will include,
J11 1120  1    as far as possible, data on these aspects of growth:
J11 1120 11    size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity
J11 1130  9    is reached; time required to reach maturity; rate of
J11 1140  6    growth both before and after this crucial stage; and
J11 1150  3    maximum length, with confirmation or amplification
J11 1160  1    of Oliver's figures. Definite information on the growth
J11 1160  9    of senile individuals is lacking.
J11 1170  4    _ANACONDA:_
J11 1170  5       At birth, this species varies considerably in size.
J11 1180  4    A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo, near
J11 1190  3    Chicago, ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches
J11 1190 13    and averaged 29 inches. Lawrence E. Griffin gives measurements
J11 1200  8    of nineteen young anacondas, presumably members of
J11 1210  6    a brood, from "South America"; the extreme measurements
J11 1220  4    of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield
J11 1230  4    brood and its average. Raymond L. Ditmars had two broods
J11 1250  3    that averaged 27 inches. R. R. Mole and F. W. Urich
J11 1260  2    give approximately 20 inches as the average length
J11 1260 10    of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco
J11 1270  9    estuaries. William Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4
J11 1280  6    ounces (this snake must have been emaciated) for the
J11 1290  3    length and the weight of a young anaconda from British
J11 1290 13    Guiana. In contrast, Ditmars recorded the average length
J11 1300  8    of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches,
J11 1310 10    and four young were born in London at a length of 35
J11 1320  6    or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces.
J11 1330  1    Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces.
J11 1330 12    A difference between subspecies might explain the great
J11 1340  7    range in size.
J11 1350  1       I have little information on the anaconda's rate
J11 1350  9    of growth. Hans Schweizer had one that increased from
J11 1370  7    19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years, and
J11 1380  5    J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet
J11 1390  4    to nearly 10 in about six years. It is very unlikely
J11 1390 15    that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal
J11 1400 10    rate.
J11 1400 11       In 1948, Afranio do Amaral, the noted Brazilian
J11 1410  7    herpetologist, wrote a technical paper on the giant
J11 1420  6    snakes. He concluded that the anaconda's maximum length
J11 1430  3    is 12 or 13 (perhaps 14) meters, which would approximate
J11 1440  1    from 39 to 42 feet (14 meters is slightly less that
J11 1440 12    46 feet). Thus, his estimate lies between Oliver's
J11 1450  6    suggestion of at least 37 feet and the 50-foot "monstrous
J11 1460  6    freaks" intimated by Heuvelmans.
J11 1470  1       The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda
J11 1470  9    was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon, a petroleum
J11 1480  8    geologist of the Richmond Oil Company, and reported
J11 1490  5    in 1944 by Emmett R. Dunn. However, as a field measurement,
J11 1500  5    it is open to question. Oliver's 37-1/2 feet is partly
J11 1510  4    based on this report and can be accepted as probable.
J11 1520  1    However, many herpetologists remain skeptical and would
J11 1520  8    prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet.
J11 1530  8       It is possible that especially large anacondas will
J11 1540  4    prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area.
J11 1550  4    In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic
J11 1560  1    of subspecies.
J11 1560  3    _BOA CONSTRICTOR:_
J11 1560  5       A Colombian female's brood of sixteen boa constrictors
J11 1570  5    born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 20 inches. This
J11 1580  4    birth length seems to be typical. When some thirteen
J11 1590  1    records of newly and recently born individuals are
J11 1590  9    collated, little or no correlation between length and
J11 1600  7    distribution can be detected. The range is from 14
J11 1610  5    to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat
J11 1620  1    unusual birth of four by a Central American female
J11 1620 10    (see chapter on Laying, Brooding, Hatching, and Birth),
J11 1630  7    the latter on a "normal" newly born individual. However,
J11 1640  5    as so many of the records are not certainly based on
J11 1650  5    newborn snakes, these data must be taken tentatively;
J11 1660  1    final conclusions will have to await the measurements
J11 1660  9    of broods from definite localities.
J11 1670  4       Alphonse R. Hoge's measurements of several very
J11 1680  4    young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the
J11 1690  1    female is slightly larger than the male.
J11 1690  8       I have surprisingly little information on the size
J11 1700  5    and age at maturity. Carl Kauffeld has written to me
J11 1710  4    of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in
J11 1710 14    March 1940. One female, collected on an island off
J11 1720  9    the coast of Nicaragua, was gravid and measured 4 feet
J11 1730  7    8 inches from snout to vent (her tail should be between
J11 1740  6    6 and 7 inches long). The female from Central America
J11 1750  2    which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches
J11 1750 13    long.
J11 1760  1       What data there are on growth indicate considerable
J11 1760  9    variation in rate; unfortunately, no one has kept complete
J11 1770  9    records of one individual, whereas many have been made
J11 1780  6    for a very short period of time. The results are too
J11 1790  5    varied to allow generalization.
