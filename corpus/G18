G18 0010  1       AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature
G18 0020  1    more than half are practically unknown to readers of
G18 0020 10    English. Of these there are surely few that would be
G18 0030  8    more rewarding discoveries than Verner von Heidenstam,
G18 0040  4    the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award
G18 0050  3    in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years
G18 0050 12    ago. Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates
G18 0060 10    the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into
G18 0070  8    the present. In the following sketch we shall present
G18 0080  4    a brief outline of his life and let him as much as
G18 0090  1    possible speak for himself.
G18 0090  5       Heidenstam was born in 1859, of a prosperous family.
G18 0100  4    On his father's side he was of German descent, on his
G18 0110  3    mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility. The family
G18 0120  1    estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va^ttern
G18 0120  9    in south central Sweden. It is a lonely, rather desolate
G18 0130  8    region, but full of legendary and historic associations.
G18 0140  4    As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary,
G18 0150  3    absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions
G18 0150 12    of Sweden's ancient glory. He liked to fancy himself
G18 0160  9    as a chieftain and to dress for the part. Being somewhat
G18 0170  9    delicate in health, at the age of sixteen he was sent
G18 0180  7    to Southern Europe, for which he at once developed
G18 0190  2    a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following
G18 0190 13    ten years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece,
G18 0200 10    Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine. In one of his summers
G18 0210  8    at home he married, to the great disapproval of his
G18 0220  5    father, who objected because of his extreme youth.
G18 0230  1       Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio
G18 0230 10    of Gerome in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the
G18 0240 10    artists, but soon found that whatever talent he might
G18 0250  6    have did not lie in that direction. He gives us an
G18 0260  5    account of this in his lively and humorous poem, "The
G18 0270  1    Happy Artists". "I scanned the world through printed
G18 0270  9    symbol swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove
G18 0280  9    to see The inner man. I looked unceasingly With my
G18 0290  6    cold mind and with my burning heart". In this final
G18 0300  4    line, we have the key to his nature. Few writers have
G18 0310  2    better understood their deepest selves. Heidenstam
G18 0310  8    could never be satisfied by surface. It may, however,
G18 0320  7    be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have
G18 0330  5    been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.
G18 0340  1       The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad
G18 0340  9    was a volume of poems, Pilgrimage and Wander-Years
G18 0350  9    (Vallfart och vandringsar), published in 1888. It was
G18 0360  6    a brilliant debut, so much so indeed that it aroused
G18 0370  5    a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's
G18 0380  1    Childe Harold. Professor Fredrik Bo^o^k, Sweden's foremost
G18 0390  2    critic of the period, acclaims it as follows: "In this
G18 0400  2    we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful,
G18 0400 11    plastic, racy, vivid. In a bold, sometimes careless,
G18 0410  7    form there is nothing academic; all is seen and felt
G18 0420  6    and experienced, the observation is sharp and the imagination
G18 0430  4    lively. The young poet-painter reproduces the French
G18 0440  1    life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand
G18 0440 11    and One Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars
G18 0450  9    of Damascus. In the care-free indolence of the East
G18 0460  7    he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence,
G18 0470  4    and for that reason he loves it. And yet amid all the
G18 0480  2    gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle
G18 0480 12    of short poems, "Thoughts in Loneliness", filled with
G18 0490  8    brooding, melancholy, and sombre longing".
G18 0500  4       Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable
G18 0510  5    as "Nameless and Immortal", which at once took rank
G18 0520  4    among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish
G18 0520 13    language. It celebrates the unknown architect who designed
G18 0530  8    the temple of Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon
G18 0540  8    the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in
G18 0550  5    existence. On the eve of his return to their native
G18 0560  2    Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which
G18 0560 12    rises before them in its completed perfection. The
G18 0570  8    supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled, says
G18 0580  6    the wife, her husband has achieved immortality. Not
G18 0590  2    so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple
G18 0600  1    that is immortal. "The man's true reputation is his
G18 0600 10    work".
G18 0610  1       The short poems grouped at the end of the volume
G18 0610 11    as "Thoughts in Loneliness" is, as Professor Bo^o^k
G18 0620  7    indicated, in sharp contrast with the others. It consists
G18 0630  6    of fragmentary personal revelations, such as "The Spark":
G18 0640  5    "There is a spark dwells deep within my soul. To get
G18 0650  5    it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both
G18 0660  3    first and last, the whole. It slips away, it burns
G18 0660 13    and tortures me. That little spark is all the wealth
G18 0670  9    I know, That little spark is my life's misery". A dominant
G18 0680  7    motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its
G18 0690  6    boyhood associations: "Not men-folk, but the fields
G18 0700  3    where I would stray, The stones where as a child I
G18 0700 14    used to play". He is utterly disappointed in himself
G18 0710  9    and in the desultory life he has been leading. What
G18 0720  7    he really wants is to find "a sacred cause" to which
G18 0730  5    he can honestly devote himself. This restless individualism
G18 0740  2    found its answer when he returned to live nearly all
G18 0750  1    the rest of his life in Sweden. His cause was to commemorate
G18 0750 13    the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate
G18 0760 11    it in the present.
G18 0770  1       He did not, however, find himself at once. His next
G18 0770 11    major work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic
G18 0780  9    epic in prose, entitled Hans Alienus, which Professor
G18 0790  5    Bo^o^k describes as a monument on the grave of his
G18 0800  6    carefree and indolent youth. The hero, who is himself,
G18 0810  2    is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of
G18 0810 12    the East, a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from
G18 0820 10    Professor Bo^o^k again, "even in the pleasure gardens
G18 0830  6    of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search
G18 0840  4    after the meaning of life. He is driven back by his
G18 0850  2    yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the
G18 0850 12    forest of Tiveden".
G18 0860  2       From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his
G18 0870  1    deeper self. By the death of his father in 1888 he
G18 0870 12    had come into possession of the family estate and had
G18 0880  7    re-assumed its traditions. He did not, however, settle
G18 0890  5    back into acquiescence with things as they were. Like
G18 0900  2    his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had
G18 0900 10    little patience with collective mediocrity. He saw
G18 0910  7    Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism,
G18 0920  5    indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory.
G18 0930  3    Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear
G18 0940  1    down the old structures and build anew from the ground
G18 0940 11    up. Heidenstam's conception, on the contrary, was to
G18 0950  7    revive the present by the memories of the past.
G18 0960  4    ##
G18 0960  5    Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's later
G18 0970  2    work was concerned with Sweden. With the first of a
G18 0970 12    group of historical novels, The Charles Men (Karolinerna),
G18 0980  8    published in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of
G18 0990  9    his career. In scope and power it can only be compared
G18 1000  8    to Tolstoy's War and Peace. About one-third as long,
G18 1010  6    it is less intimate and detailed, but better coordinated,
G18 1020  2    more concise and more dramatic. Though it centers around
G18 1030  1    the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles XII,
G18 1030  9    the true hero is not finally the king himself. Hence
G18 1040  8    the title of the book, referring to the soldiers and
G18 1050  5    subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava,
G18 1060  3    to quote from the novel, "the wreath he twined for
G18 1070  1    himself slipped down upon his people".
G18 1070  7       The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative
G18 1080  7    but of a group of short stories, each depicting a special
G18 1090  5    phase of the general subject. Somewhat uneven in interest
G18 1100  3    for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among
G18 1110  1    the finest of their kind in literature. They comprise
G18 1110 10    a great variety of scene and interest: grim episodes
G18 1120  7    of war, idyllic interludes, superb canvases of world-shaking
G18 1130  5    events, and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters.
G18 1140  4    The general effect is tragic. Almost nothing is said
G18 1150  3    of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme
G18 1150 10    being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their
G18 1160 10    idolized king in misfortune and defeat.
G18 1170  3       To carry out this exalted conception the author
G18 1180  2    has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power
G18 1180 10    we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them
G18 1190  8    out on a grand scale. His peculiar gift, as had been
G18 1200  6    suggested before, is his intensity. George Meredith
G18 1210  2    has said that fervor is the core of style. Of few authors
G18 1220  1    is this more true than of Heidenstam. The Charles Men
G18 1220 11    has a tremendous range of characters, of common folk
G18 1230  7    even more than of major figures. The career of Charles
G18 1240  6    XII is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon.
G18 1250  3    His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's was
G18 1260  2    Julius Caesar. His purpose, however, was not to establish
G18 1260 11    an empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice.
G18 1270 10    Each aspired to be a god in human form, but with each
G18 1280 11    it was a different kind of god. Each failed catastrophically
G18 1290  4    in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the
G18 1300  4    country that worshipped him. Each is still glorified
G18 1310  1    as a national hero.
G18 1310  5       The first half of The Charles Men, ending on the
G18 1320  4    climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically
G18 1330  1    coherent than the second. After the collapse of that
G18 1330 10    desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the
G18 1340  9    king degenerated for a time into a futility that was
G18 1350  7    not merely pitiable but often ridiculous. Like Napoleon,
G18 1360  3    he was the worst of losers. There are, however, some
G18 1370  1    wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part,
G18 1370 10    concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity.
G18 1380  8    Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude
G18 1390  6    and patient cheerfulness. This comes out in "When the
G18 1400  5    Bells Ring", which describes the rallying of the peasants
G18 1410  2    in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.
G18 1420  1       In "The King's Ride", Charles breaks out of a long
G18 1420 11    period of petulance and inertia, regains his old self,
G18 1430  9    escapes from Turkey, and finally reaches his own land
G18 1440  7    after an absence of eighteen years. He finds it in
G18 1450  5    utter misery and desolation. All his people ask for
G18 1460  1    is no more war. But he plunges into yet another, this
G18 1460 12    time with Norway, and is killed in an assault on the
G18 1470  9    fortress of Fredrikshall, being only thirty-six years
G18 1480  5    of age when he died. He had become king at fifteen.
G18 1490  1       Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of
G18 1490  9    popular feeling. From being a hated tyrant and madman
G18 1500  9    he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best
G18 1510  8    in the history of Sweden. This is brought out in the
G18 1520  5    next to last chapter of the book, "A Hero's Funeral",
G18 1530  2    written in the form of an impassioned prose poem. Slowly
G18 1540  1    the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through
G18 1540  9    the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly
G18 1550  8    lighted cathedral, the shrine of so many precious memories.
G18 1560  6    The guns are fired, the hymns are sung, and the body
G18 1570  5    of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside
G18 1580  1    the tombs of his ancestors. As he had longed to be,
G18 1580 12    he became the echo of a saga.
G18 1590  5       Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about
G18 1600  2    earlier figures revered in Swedish memory. Excellent
G18 1600  9    in their way, they lack the wide appeal of The Charles
G18 1610 10    Men, and need not detain us here. It is different with
G18 1620  9    his volume The Swedes and Their Chieftains (Svenskarna
G18 1630  5    och deras ho^vdingar), a history intended for the general
G18 1640  5    reader and particularly suited for high school students.
G18 1650  3    Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to
G18 1650 11    Swedish history for readers of other countries. Some
G18 1660  8    of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural,
G18 1670  6    as suited to the legendary background. These are suggestive
G18 1680  4    of Selma Lagerlo^f. Especially touching is the chapter,
G18 1690  4    "The Little Sister", about a king's daughter who became
G18 1700  3    a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta. The record teems
G18 1710  2    with romance and adventure. Gustaf Vasa is a superb
G18 1710 11    example, and Charles X, the conqueror of Denmark,
G18 1720  8    hardly less so. Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII
G18 1730  6    it is unnecessary to speak.
