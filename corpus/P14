P14 0010  1       She was moving through a screen of hemlocks, in
P14 0010 10    among the white birch and maples. The sounds from the
P14 0020  8    quarry began to pulse in her ears. She stood, once
P14 0030  2    more listening. She had never been here at this hour.
P14 0040  2    She felt as if some dark, totally unfamiliar shape
P14 0040 11    would clutch at her arm; but she found the path she
P14 0050 10    always used, the stubs of branches she had broken,
P14 0060  4    those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily now,
P14 0070  2    and more slowly, until she could see the dark glisten
P14 0070 12    of water beneath her.
P14 0080  3       If I ever committed suicide, she thought, I would
P14 0090  2    dive straight down from here- and no one would find
P14 0090 12    me for days. She smiled, and expertly let herself downward,
P14 0100  8    holding this known root or that, her sneakers sliding
P14 0110  7    in the leaves.
P14 0110 10       She jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and,
P14 0120  9    seating herself, shook her short-cut brown hair and
P14 0130  4    tilted her chin far upward. The reedy music of the
P14 0140  1    frogs had faded, but presently it began again, growing
P14 0140 10    in volume until it was vibrant. Julia felt at peace
P14 0150  8    and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly
P14 0160  4    around the bent knees. She had accomplished a miracle.
P14 0170  1    This was her place. The hour couldn't change it ...
P14 0170 11    Only- only- her thoughts were a little strange. They
P14 0180 11    were becoming confused. Perhaps it was because it was
P14 0190  8    so late, and because she had no business to be here
P14 0200  6    now.
P14 0200  7       She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago, in the
P14 0210  5    Easter holidays, with her at one of those awful Friday
P14 0220  1    Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her
P14 0220 10    attend. "Hello, Julie, how are you"? ... And then off
P14 0230 10    he went so casually, to someone else with breasts better
P14 0240  7    developed, more obvious in a lower-cut dress, someone
P14 0250  5    without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to
P14 0260  2    find words that would hold him. I wish he was with
P14 0260 13    me now, she thought, and that we were both the ages
P14 0270  9    we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute
P14 0280  5    embarrassment. Oh God! I wish I were older or younger,
P14 0290  4    Julia Bentley thought. I wish so much someone loved
P14 0300  1    me.
P14 0300  2    #CHAPTER 7#
P14 0300  4    George Rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime
P14 0310  3    during the night- Millie, in a white robe, standing
P14 0320  1    like a ghost at the threshold. She had vanished; he
P14 0320 11    must have slept again. He was staring at the blue china
P14 0330  9    lamp left on beside him. It seemed too much trouble
P14 0340  6    even to reach for the switch; but of course the impossible
P14 0350  3    effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday
P14 0360  1    morning. This room was like a prison. He would not
P14 0360 11    be indebted to Sam! Below him, as if at the end of
P14 0370 11    some remote tunnel, he heard the humming of a vacuum
P14 0380  6    cleaner. His fingers fumbled across the bandages. They
P14 0390  2    had left both of his eyes uncovered ... Well, he told
P14 0390 13    himself, let's put the show on the road.
P14 0400  8       He was walking across to the bathroom. He drank
P14 0410  6    a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands.
P14 0420  3    A fearful pain had come from his head, as if the water
P14 0430  1    were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding
P14 0430 10    them ... He recognized his jacket and trousers. The
P14 0450  6    fabric was dark; the stains weren't too apparent; and
P14 0460  4    there were his shoes, thank God, but his shirt was
P14 0470  2    one terrible mess.
P14 0470  5       He shivered, and then tore away the blood-soaked
P14 0480  3    parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf.
P14 0490  1    Sam would be amazed to find him gone. Millie would
P14 0490 11    have to understand. She must have put his clothes in
P14 0500  8    the closet. He found a lump rising in his throat because
P14 0510  5    of that one simple act of tidiness. He was on the verge
P14 0520  3    of tears. Alex Poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt
P14 0530  1    to that effete gentleman. At least Alex had told him
P14 0530 11    he wasn't dying. Perhaps George Rawlings would be better
P14 0540  7    off dead.
P14 0540  9       What time was it? He peered at his wristwatch. Strange,
P14 0550 10    it was still running. A quarter to seven. Too early
P14 0560  7    for a vacuum cleaner, but probably Sam wanted the whole
P14 0570  5    house in order before he came downstairs. He was kneeling
P14 0580  3    to tie his shoelaces. His fingers felt absurdly thick
P14 0590  1    and clumsy. He rose slowly and looked into the mirror
P14 0590 11    on the inside of the closet door. He barely knew himself.
P14 0600  8    This was some freak, two strands of adhesive tape across
P14 0610  6    his nose, like ugly roots from the mass of gauze, suddenly
P14 0620  4    moist over his cheekbones. The surface, however, was
P14 0630  2    perfectly white.
P14 0630  4       He was drinking another glass of water. It was after
P14 0640  4    seven o'clock. He was supposed to be in court this
P14 0640 14    afternoon, at City Hall. Who would take over? He'd
P14 0650  9    have to think, but the main thing, the imperative necessity,
P14 0660  8    was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about, and
P14 0670  7    before Millie detained him with sympathy.
P14 0680  1       He entered the hallway. He was actually walking
P14 0680  9    down the stairs. A plane up in the sky, above the clouds,
P14 0690 11    and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying
P14 0700  7    to get away.
P14 0700 10       "Father, is that you"? The voice issued from the
P14 0710  8    cavern of the hall below. George did not reply. "Is
P14 0720  5    that you, Father? ... Who's there"?
P14 0730  1       For a moment he felt like a thief discovered. Then
P14 0730 11    Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining
P14 0740  9    room. She stood gazing at him.
P14 0750  3       "Uncle George"!
P14 0750  5       He was trying to smile at her.
P14 0760  3       "Gosh! You shouldn't be up, should you"?
P14 0770  1       "I- I was just leaving here, Julie ... I'm all
P14 0770 10    set. Just about to call a taxi".
P14 0780  6       She was wearing some sort of gray blazer. She seemed
P14 0790  4    overly tall, her brow knitted in concern. "Well, at
P14 0800  2    least you won't have to do that", she was saying. "I'm
P14 0810  1    about to leave myself. I'll drop you off".
P14 0810  9       "You're leaving"?
P14 0820  2       "I'm going back to school", she answered. "Pietro's
P14 0830  2    driving me. I'm just finishing breakfast ... But have
P14 0840  2    you told Mother you were going"? she asked him.
P14 0840 11       "No ... I just don't want anyone disturbed, Julie.
P14 0850  9    That's my wish. It's quite a big one", he added.
P14 0860  8       Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright
P14 0870  6    shaft of sunlight. "Well, won't you come in then, have
P14 0880  5    a cup of coffee- or something? ... Or maybe a drink"?
P14 0890  3    she asked, in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated,
P14 0890 12    considerate, and yet perhaps partly scornful. He tried
P14 0900  8    to see her face more clearly.
P14 0910  3       "No- nothing at all", he said after a moment's hesitation.
P14 0920  2    "I'll just wait for you here".
P14 0920  8       He leaned his head against the wood paneling behind
P14 0930  8    him, but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves
P14 0940  6    against his eyelids. He raised them. Julia moved past.
P14 0950  4       "I have to say good-by upstairs. I won't be long".
P14 0960  3       "As a great favor, Julie", he said, "please don't
P14 0970  2    mention you've seen me".
P14 0970  6       "Not to anyone"?
P14 0980  1       "No- please ... "I'll call your mother as soon
P14 0980  9    as I get home. It'll be so much easier".
P14 0990  9       "All right ..." She was staring at him.
P14 1000  6       "I'm fine, Julie ... Please, you just go ahead".
P14 1010  5       She had disappeared. He could feel a pulse pounding
P14 1020  3    against the bandages. He imagined Sam's voice: "George,
P14 1030  1    what the hell goes on"? I wouldn't have the strength
P14 1040  1    to answer, he thought. Maybe I couldn't have called
P14 1040 10    a taxi.
P14 1050  1       He could hear the footsteps overhead. He saw the
P14 1050 10    suitcase, which Julia was holding. He stood up.
P14 1060  7       "I'll take that, Julie- for you".
P14 1070  5       "Oh no", she said. "I can manage".
P14 1080  1       She went ahead of him. Outside the Lincoln was parked.
P14 1080 11    He could hardly believe he was getting in. Pietro was
P14 1090  9    gazing at him in an insolent, disdainful fashion; but
P14 1100  4    that didn't matter.
P14 1100  7       We'll drop Mr. Rawlings off in Ardmore", Julia said,
P14 1110  9    and for the merest second George was reminded of her
P14 1120  7    father's tone with servants. To the manner born- odd
P14 1130  6    to have such a thought at a time like this; yet her
P14 1140  3    inflection seemed forced or rehearsed. He could not
P14 1140 11    stop to analyze. He had never felt particularly close
P14 1150  9    to her. Carrie seemed more affectionate, but obviously
P14 1160  5    Julia had respected his request. He took her hand.
P14 1170  5       "I wish I didn't have to go back to school", she
P14 1180  2    said, and then, "I wish you lived in New York. That's
P14 1190  1    in the opposite direction".
P14 1190  5       "I wish I did", he responded. "I wish I wasn't wearing
P14 1200  6    this ridiculous costume, and that we could go to a
P14 1210  6    theater together, or a nice restaurant, forget we knew
P14 1220  2    ..." He stopped speaking.
P14 1220  6       "Forget we ever knew what"?
P14 1230  1       "Oh, just sort of everything in general".
P14 1240  1       She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their
P14 1240  8    pace. "I know you feel badly, but that sounds like
P14 1250  7    such a queer thing for you to say".
P14 1260  1       "Does it"? he asked. "Yes, perhaps. I'm supposed
P14 1270  1    to joke about things, aren't I? ... But sometimes life
P14 1275  1    can be rather a disappointing business".
P14 1280  6       His voice seemed thick and purposeless. He relinquished
P14 1290  5    her hand. He could see the stone building where he
P14 1300  3    lived. Just a few more steps ... Abruptly he reached
P14 1310  1    into his pocket. Yes, there was the key.
P14 1310  9       "Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself"?
P14 1320  7    she asked him.
P14 1320 10       For a moment he smiled. "Yes, Julie dear. You've
P14 1330  8    done me the greatest possible service. By myself I'll
P14 1340  6    be fine".
P14 1340  8       "Take care of yourself then".
P14 1350  4       "I will ... you, also ... don't work too hard".
P14 1360  3       It was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through
P14 1370  1    the courtyard he regretted it. He should have discovered
P14 1370 10    a more tender farewell. Someone shouted at him, "Well!
P14 1380  8    Will you look at George Rawlings! What happened to
P14 1390  7    you"?
P14 1390  8       "I bumped into a door handle", George said.
P14 1400  7       Someone laughed. George walked steadily ahead into
P14 1410  5    his entry. His bandages seemed on fire. He had shut
P14 1420  4    his door with the brass number screwed to it. In the
P14 1420 15    kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp. Just one
P14 1430  9    or two swallows, he told himself, enough to lessen
P14 1440  6    some of the pain.
P14 1440 10       He was telephoning. "No, Millie, I'm home ... No,
P14 1450  7    really, right as rain ... Tell Sam not to worry about
P14 1460  8    the car. I'll get it hauled away ... No, please- no
P14 1470  4    visit today- I'll be asleep ... For God's sake, don't
P14 1480  3    worry. That upsets me more than anything ... Yes,
P14 1485  1    sure, I'll see the doctor- this evening, if you insist
P14 1490 10    ...".
P14 1500  1       There was one more call to make.
P14 1500  8       "Joan, did I wake you"? he asked. "Yes, I thought
P14 1510  6    you'd probably be up ... Look, sweetheart, some fool
P14 1520  3    was ... happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated
P14 1530  1    last night. Unfortunately it turned out to be me, but
P14 1530 11    I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss ... Oh
P14 1540 11    hell no, I'm not in a hospital. I won't be in town
P14 1550  6    for a couple of days, though, and there's that case
P14 1560  3    I was supposed to handle this afternoon. Too bad a
P14 1560 13    jury isn't involved. I might struggle in for a jury.
P14 1570 10    I'd win hands down. But I thought maybe Tony Elliott
P14 1580  7    could pinch-hit for me. He'll understand- you might
P14 1590  3    give him sort of a tactful nudge. He's got all the
P14 1600  4    facts. I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's
P14 1610  1    really just a routine thing ... What? ... No, darling
P14 1610 11    I'd rather you didn't come out". A smile pulled at
P14 1620  9    the lower strip of adhesive tape. "Don't even send
P14 1630  6    flowers. I'll see you Wednesday. I'll bribe you with
P14 1640  5    a nice"- He was about to say "double martini" but thought
P14 1650  4    better of it. "I'll take you out to dinner. Okay? ..."
P14 1660  1       He had put down the receiver. A strange relationship
P14 1670  1    between Joan Fulbright and himself. Who knew about
P14 1670  9    it? She lived alone in the older part of the city,
P14 1680 11    in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade
P14 1690  5    some early settler had constructed. She had two tiny
P14 1700  4    rooms on the second floor. She was a clever girl, a
P14 1700 15    most efficient secretary. She let him come and go as
P14 1710 10    he pleased, or as it pleased her. In the office you
P14 1720  8    might have thought them only casual friends; yet if
P14 1730  2    he said: Make an excuse yourself, come out here today,
P14 1740  1    she would have been on the next train- and, similarly,
P14 1740 11    if she had been in need, he would have gone to her.
