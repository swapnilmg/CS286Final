C08 0010  1       Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon.
C08 0010  9    Sat there and as a woman sang, she kept getting thinner
C08 0020 10    and thinner, right before my eyes, and the eyes of
C08 0030  8    some 5,500 other people.
C08 0030 12       I make this observation about the lady, Miss Judy
C08 0040  8    Garland, because she brought up the subject herself
C08 0050  5    in telling a story about a British female reporter
C08 0060  2    who flattered her terribly in London recently and then
C08 0060 11    wrote in the paper the next day:
C08 0070  7       "Judy Garland has arrived in London. She's not chubby.
C08 0080  6    She's not plump. She's fat".
C08 0090  1       But who cares, when the lady sings? Certainly not
C08 0090 10    the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had
C08 0100  7    at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet.
C08 0110  5    They applauded every number, not only at its conclusion
C08 0120  2    but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes
C08 0130  1    at the first chord.
C08 0130  5       And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which
C08 0140  2    seemed, at times, a blessed relief from the way-out
C08 0140 12    compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated
C08 0150  8    these proceedings. Things like "When You're Smiling",
C08 0170  6    "Almost Like Being In Love", "Do It Again", "Born to
C08 0180  7    Wander", "Alone Together", "Who Cares?", "Puttin' on
C08 0190  5    the Ritz", "How Long Has This Been Going On?" and her
C08 0200  9    own personal songs like "The Man That Got Away", and
C08 0210  8    the inevitable "Over the Rainbow".
C08 0220  2       Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers
C08 0230  1    of our time but she is one of the superb showmen. At
C08 0230 13    the start of her program there were evidences of pique.
C08 0240  8    She had held to the letter of her contract and didn't
C08 0250  6    come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m., the appointed
C08 0260  4    hour, although the Music at Newport people had tried
C08 0270  2    to get the program underway at 3. Then there was a
C08 0270 13    bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra
C08 0280  8    wedged into its chairs.
C08 0290  1       Along about 4:30, just when it was getting to be
C08 0290 11    about time to turn the audience over and toast them
C08 0300  9    on the other side, Judy came on singing, in a short-skirted
C08 0310  8    blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped
C08 0320  3    in the wind. Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately
C08 0330  1    combed on the left which happened to be the direction
C08 0330 11    from which a brisk breeze was blowing.
C08 0340  4       In her first song she waved away one encroaching
C08 0350  2    photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden
C08 0350  9    and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe
C08 0360  9    their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range.
C08 0370  6       There also came a brief contretemps with the sound
C08 0380  4    mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during
C08 0390  1    a quiet moment near the conclusion of "Do It Again",
C08 0390 11    and she made the tart observation that "I never saw
C08 0400 10    so much moving about in an audience".
C08 0410  4       But it didn't take Judy Garland, showman, long to
C08 0420  3    realize that this sort of thing was par for the course
C08 0420 14    at Newport and that you have to learn to live with
C08 0430 11    it. Before her chore was finished she was rescuing
C08 0440  6    wind-blown sheets of music, trundling microphones about
C08 0450  3    the stage, helping to move the piano and otherwise
C08 0450 12    joining in the informal atmosphere.
C08 0460  5       And time after time she really belted out her songs.
C08 0470  5    Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged-
C08 0480  3    which was the way I felt about her "Come Rain or Come
C08 0490  1    Shine"- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent,
C08 0490  8    like her shatteringly beautiful "Beautiful Weather".
C08 0500  5       To her partisan audience, such picayune haggling
C08 0510  5    would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving
C08 0520  4    to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their
C08 0530  1    haunches and cried for more, as though they could never
C08 0530 11    get enough.
C08 0540  1       They were rewarded with splendid, exciting, singing.
C08 0540  8    Her "Rockabye Your Baby" was as good as it can be done,
C08 0550 11    and her really personal songs, like "The Man That Got
C08 0560  8    Away" were deeply moving.
C08 0570  1       The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had
C08 0570 10    heard "Over The Rainbow"- although the fellow that
C08 0580  8    kept crying for "Get Happy" had to go home unhappy,
C08 0590  8    about that item anyway. She was generous with her encores
C08 0600  6    and the audience was equally so with its cheers and
C08 0610  4    applause and flowers.
C08 0610  7       All went home happy except the Newport police, who
C08 0620  5    feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet
C08 0630  3    head-on the night crowd drawing nigh, and those deprived
C08 0630 13    of their happy hour at the cocktail bar.
C08 0650  1       In Newport last night there were flashes of distant
C08 0650 10    lightning in the northern skies. This was perhaps symbolic
C08 0660  9    of the jazz of the evening- flashes in the distance,
C08 0670  5    but no storm.
C08 0670  8       Several times it came near breaking, and there were
C08 0680  8    in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's
C08 0690  4    big band, which is about as fine an aggregation as
C08 0700  2    has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond
C08 0710  1    found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap.
C08 0710 10       Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid
C08 0720  8    sense of swing, and what it does seems far more meaningful
C08 0730  6    than most of the noise generated by the big concert
C08 0740  3    aggregations.
C08 0740  4       But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and
C08 0750  4    wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's
C08 0760  1    baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's
C08 0760 10    arrangement of "Django's Castle".
C08 0770  4       For subtle swinging rhythms, I could admire intensely
C08 0780  5    Mulligan's version of "Weep", and the fireworks went
C08 0790  4    on display in "18 Carrots for Robert", a sax tribute
C08 0800  2    to Johnny Hodges.
C08 0800  5       There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan
C08 0810  4    performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers,
C08 0820  3    who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such
C08 0830  1    a small group. Unfortunately, Blakey doesn't choose
C08 0830  8    to work much of the time in this vein. He prefers to
C08 0840 10    have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief
C08 0850  7    glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.
C08 0860  1       What we did get, however, was impressive.
C08 0860  8       A few drops of rain just before midnight, when Sarah
C08 0870  8    Vaughan was in the midst of her first number, scattered
C08 0880  5    the more timid members of the audience briefly, but
C08 0890  2    at this hour and with Sarah on the stand, most of the
C08 0890 14    listeners didn't care whether they got wet.
C08 0900  7       Miss Vaughan was back in top form, somehow mellowed
C08 0910  6    and improved with the passage of time- like a fine
C08 0920  6    wine. After the spate of female vocalists we have been
C08 0930  1    having, all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure
C08 0930 12    and then tried to see what they could do that might
C08 0940  9    make her seem old hat, it seemed that all that has
C08 0950  5    happened is to make the real thing seem better than
C08 0960  1    ever.
C08 0960  2    #JAZZ THREE OPEN PROGRAM#
C08 0960  6    The evening program was opened by the Jazz Three, a
C08 0970  6    Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass,
C08 0980  3    Jack Warner, drums, and Don Cook, piano. This was a
C08 0990  1    continuation of a good idea which was first tried out
C08 0990 11    Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group, also local
C08 1000  8    talent, went on first.
C08 1010  1       Putting on local musicians at this place in the
C08 1010  9    program serves a triple purpose: it saves the top flight
C08 1020  7    jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot,
C08 1030  4    when the audience is cold, restless, and in flux; it
C08 1040  2    prevents late-comers from missing some of the people
C08 1040 11    they have come a long way to hear, and it gives the
C08 1050 11    resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous
C08 1060  6    Newport audience.
C08 1060  8       The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship,
C08 1070  5    not only in their own chosen set, but as the emergency
C08 1080  5    accompanists for Al Minns + Leon James, the superb
C08 1090  2    jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for
C08 1090 11    three successive years, gradually moving up from a
C08 1100  8    morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a
C08 1110  6    spot on the evening program.
C08 1110 11    #JULIE WILSON SINGS#
C08 1120  2    Julie Wilson, a vigorous vocalist without many wild
C08 1120 10    twists, sang a set, a large part of which consisted
C08 1130 10    of such seldom heard old oldies as "Hard-Hearted Hannah,
C08 1140  6    the Vamp of Savannah", and the delightful "Sunday".
C08 1150  4    She frosted the cake with the always reliable "Bill
C08 1160  2    Bailey".
C08 1160  3       From this taste of the 1920s, we leaped way out
C08 1170  4    to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz, which
C08 1180  2    did lovely, subtle things for "Baubles, Bangles and
C08 1180 10    Beads", and a couple of ballards.
C08 1190  6       Getz is a difficult musician to categorize. He plays
C08 1200  3    his sax principally for beauty of tone, rather than
C08 1210  1    for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations,
C08 1210  7    and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating
C08 1220  9    the melody after the improvising is over. In this he
C08 1230  6    is sticking with tradition, however far removed from
C08 1240  2    it he may seem to be.
C08 1240  8    #SHEARING TAKES OVER#
C08 1240 11    George Shearing took over with his well disciplined
C08 1250  7    group, a sextet consisting of vibes, guitar, bass,
C08 1260  4    drums, Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer. He met
C08 1270  3    with enthusiastic audience approval, especially when
C08 1270  9    he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the
C08 1280  9    Mambo. Shearing, himself, seemed to me to be playing
C08 1290  7    better piano than in his recent Newport appearances.
C08 1300  2       A very casual, pleasant program- one of those easy-going
C08 1310  3    things that make Newport's afternoon programs such
C08 1310 10    a relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies,
C08 1320  9    hot sun, and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least
C08 1330  8    a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music
C08 1340  6    rather than go to the beach.
C08 1340 12       Divided almost equally into two parts, it consisted
C08 1350  8    of "The Evolution of the Blues", narrated by Jon Hendricks,
C08 1360  7    who had presented it last year at the Monterey, Calif.,
C08 1370  6    Jazz Festival, and an hour-long session of Maynard
C08 1380  3    Ferguson and his orchestra, a blasting big band.
C08 1390  1       Hendricks' story was designed for children and he
C08 1390  9    had a small audience of small children right on stage
C08 1400  8    with him. Tracing the blues from its African roots
C08 1410  5    among the slaves who were brought to this country and
C08 1420  2    the West Indies, he stressed the close relationship
C08 1420 10    between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro
C08 1430 11    churches.
C08 1430 12    #SURPRISE ADDITION#
C08 1440  2    To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz
C08 1450  1    he had "Big" Miller, as a preacher-singer and Hannah
C08 1450 11    Dean, Gospel-singer, while Oscar Brown Jr., an extremely
C08 1460  7    talented young man, did a slave auctioneer's call,
C08 1470  7    a field-hands' work song, and a beautifully sung Negro
C08 1480  5    lullaby, "Brown Baby", which was one of the truly moving
C08 1490  4    moments of the festival.
C08 1490  8       One of those delightful surprise additions, which
C08 1500  4    so frequently occur in jazz programs, was an excellent
C08 1510  4    stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones, drumming
C08 1520  1    to "Old Man River", which seems to have been elected
C08 1520 11    the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this
C08 1530 10    year's concerts.
C08 1540  1       Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds
C08 1540  7    of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji, who plays
C08 1550  7    such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding
C08 1560  8    job slapping his own chest. He has been on previous
C08 1570  5    Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last
C08 1580  2    year's afternoon concerts.
C08 1580  5       Hendricks had Billy Mitchell, tenor sax; Pony Poindexter,
C08 1590  4    alto sax; Jimmy Witherspoon, blues singer (and a good
C08 1600  6    one), and the Ike Isaacs Trio, which has done such
C08 1610  2    wonderful work for two afternoons now, helping him
C08 1610 10    with the musical examples.
C08 1620  2       It all went very well.
C08 1630  1       PIANISTS who are serious about their work are likely
C08 1630 10    to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's
C08 1640  7    Sonatas. Music lovers who are not familiar with this
C08 1650  8    literature may hear an excellent example, played for
C08 1660  4    RCA by Emil Gilels. He has chosen Sonata Op. 53 in
C08 1670  4    D. The playing takes both sides of the disc. Perhaps
C08 1680  1    one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed
C08 1680 10    more often is their great length. Rhythmic interest,
C08 1690  7    melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing
C08 1700  4    are all qualities which hold one's attention with the
C08 1710  3    Gilels playing. His technique is ample and his musical
C08 1710 12    ideas are projected beautifully.
C08 1720  4       The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings
C08 1730  4    Sea Shanties in fine style. The group is superbly trained.
C08 1740  2    What a discussion can ensue when the title of this
C08 1740 12    type of song is in question. Do you say chantey, as
C08 1750 11    if the word were derived from the French word chanter,
C08 1760  6    to sing, or do you say shanty and think of a roughly
C08 1770  4    built cabin, which derives its name from the French-Canadian
C08 1780  1    use of the word chantier, with one of its meanings
C08 1780 11    given as a boat-yard? I say chantey. Either way, the
C08 1790 10    Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every
C08 1800  8    colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in
C08 1810  4    terms of agreeable listening. If your favorite song
C08 1820  1    is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.
C08 1820 10       The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore
C08 1830  6    Bastianini, a baritone whose fame is international.
