G46 0010  1    Trevelyan's Liberalism was above all a liberalism of
G46 0010  9    the spirit, a deep feeling of communion with men fighting
G46 0020  8    for country and for liberty. His passion and enthusiasm
G46 0030  5    convey the courage and high adventure of Garibaldi's
G46 0040  3    exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation
G46 0050  1    in the events described.
G46 0050  5       The three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic
G46 0060  5    of Trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous through
G46 0070  2    his later works- a genius for describing military action
G46 0080  1    with clarity and with authority. The confused rambling
G46 0080  9    of guerrilla warfare, such as most of Garibaldi's campaigns
G46 0090  8    were, was brought to life by Trevelyan's pen in some
G46 0100  8    of the best passages in the books. His personal familiarity
G46 0110  4    with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much
G46 0120  2    to the final result, but familiarity alone would not
G46 0120 11    have been enough without other qualities. Military
G46 0130  7    knowledge, love of detail, and a sure feeling for the
G46 0140  8    portrayal of action were the added ingredients.
G46 0150  2       But the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic
G46 0160  1    story. Trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge
G46 0160  7    of the issues connected with his subject. The outstanding
G46 0170  7    example was in Garibaldi and the Thousand, where he
G46 0180  6    made use of unpublished papers of Lord John Russell
G46 0190  4    and English consular materials to reveal the motives
G46 0200  1    which led the British government to permit Garibaldi
G46 0200  9    to cross the Straits of Messina.
G46 0210  5       In looking back over the volumes, it is possible
G46 0220  3    to find errors of interpretation, some of which were
G46 0220 12    not so evident at the time of writing. Thus Trevelyan
G46 0230 10    repeats the story which pictured Victor Emmanuel as
G46 0240  6    refusing to abandon the famous Statuto at the insistence
G46 0250  4    of General Radetzky. Later research has shown this
G46 0260  3    part of the legend of the Re Galantuomo to be false.
G46 0270  1    Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis,
G46 0270  8    he is unduly critical of papal and French policy, and
G46 0280  9    he is more than generous in assessing British policy.
G46 0290  5    But fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a
G46 0300  3    firm place in the list of standard works on the unification
G46 0310  1    of Italy, a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers
G46 0310 10    at the time of publication.
G46 0320  5       Trevelyan's Manin and the Venetian revolution of
G46 0330  3    1848, his last major volume on an Italian theme, was
G46 0340  2    written in a minor key. Published in 1923, it did not
G46 0340 13    gain the popular acclaim of the Garibaldi volumes,
G46 0350  6    probably because Trevelyan felt less at home with Manin,
G46 0360  7    the bourgeois lawyer, than with Garibaldi, the filibuster.
G46 0370  3    The complexities of Venetian politics eluded him, but
G46 0380  2    the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained
G46 0380 12    measures, with no superfluous passages and only an
G46 0390  8    occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading
G46 0400  7    figure. If it is not one of his best books, it can
G46 0410  4    only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with
G46 0410 11    his own Garibaldi.
G46 0420  3       Already Trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century
G46 0430  4    Italian studies with several works on English figures
G46 0440  2    of the same period. First The life of John Bright appeared
G46 0450  1    and seven years later Lord Grey of the Reform Bill.
G46 0450 11    Of the two, the life of Bright is incomparably the
G46 0460 10    better biography. Trevelyan centers too exclusively
G46 0470  4    on Bright, is insufficiently appreciative of the views
G46 0480  4    of Bright's opponents and critics, and makes light
G46 0490  1    of the genuine difficulties faced by Peel. Yet he is
G46 0490 11    right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew
G46 0500  8    the real features of the man, his tender and selfless
G46 0510  5    motives and his rugged fearless strength. In the story
G46 0520  3    of Bright and the Corn Law agitation, the Crimean War,
G46 0530  1    the American Civil War, and the franchise struggle
G46 0530  9    Trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which
G46 0540  7    enabled this independent man to exercise so immense
G46 0550  5    an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long.
G46 0560  2    Because Bright's speeches were so much a part of him,
G46 0560 12    there are long and numerous quotations, which, far
G46 0570  8    from making the biography diffuse, help to give us
G46 0580  6    the feel of the man. Associated in a sense with the
G46 0590  3    Manchester School through his mother's family, Trevelyan
G46 0600  1    conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction
G46 0600 10    and drive. Nineteenth-century virtues, however, seem
G46 0610  6    somehow to have gone out of fashion and the Bright
G46 0620  6    book has never been particularly popular.
G46 0630  1       The biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking
G46 0630  9    not a biography at all. It is a Whig history of the
G46 0640 10    "Tory reaction" which preceded the Reform Bill of 1832,
G46 0650  6    and it uses the figure of Grey to give some unity to
G46 0660  5    the narrative. The volume is a piece of passionate
G46 0670  1    special pleading, written with the heat- and often
G46 0670  9    with the wisdom, it must be said- of a Liberal damning
G46 0680  9    the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832.
G46 0690  5    Characteristically, Trevelyan enjoyed writing the work.
G46 0700  3    The theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter
G46 0710  1    of discontent and repression was, he has told us, congenial
G46 0710 11    to his artistic sense. And Grey's Northumberland background
G46 0720  6    was close to Trevelyan's own. But his concentration
G46 0730  6    on personalities and his categorical assessment of
G46 0740  3    their actions fail to convey the political complexities
G46 0750  1    of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and
G46 0750 11    confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented
G46 0760  9    industrial and social transformation. Some historians
G46 0770  4    have found his point of view not to their taste, others
G46 0780  5    have complained that he makes the Tory tradition appear
G46 0790  2    "contemptible rather than intelligible", while a sympathetic
G46 0800  1    critic has remarked that the "intricate interplay of
G46 0800  9    social dynamics and political activity of which, at
G46 0810  7    times, politicians are the ignorant marionettes is
G46 0820  4    not a field for the exercise of his talents". The Liberal-Radical
G46 0830  4    heritage which informs all of Trevelyan's interpretations
G46 0840  2    of history here seems clearly to have distorted the
G46 0840 11    issues and oversimplified the period. For once his
G46 0850  8    touch deserted him.
G46 0860  1       Research in the period of Grey and Bright led naturally
G46 0860 11    to a more ambitious work. Britain in the nineteenth
G46 0870  9    century is a textbook designed "to give the sense of
G46 0880  7    continuous growth, to show how economic led to social,
G46 0890  5    and social to political change, how the political events
G46 0900  2    reacted on the economic and social, and how new thoughts
G46 0900 12    and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated
G46 0910  9    process". The plan is admirably fulfilled for the period
G46 0920  9    up to 1832. More temperately than in the study of Grey
G46 0930  7    and despite his Liberal bias, Trevelyan vividly sketches
G46 0940  3    the England of pre-French Revolution days, portrays
G46 0950  2    the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period
G46 0950 10    in rich colors, and brings developments leading to
G46 0960  7    the Reform Bill into sharp and clear focus. His technique
G46 0970  6    is genuinely masterful. By what one reader called a
G46 0980  4    "series of dissolving views", he merges one period
G46 0990  1    into another and gives a sense of continuous growth.
G46 0990 10       But after 1832, the narrative tends to lose its
G46 1000  8    balanced, many-sided quality and to become a medley
G46 1010  6    of topics, often unconnected by any single thread.
G46 1020  1    Economic analysis was never Trevelyan's strong point
G46 1020  8    and the England of the industrial transformation cries
G46 1030  7    out for economic analysis. Yet after 1832, the interrelations
G46 1040  6    of economic and social and political affairs become
G46 1050  3    blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional
G46 1060  1    political account. Finally, the period after 1870 receives
G46 1070  1    little attention and that quite superficial. Yet Britain
G46 1070  9    in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of
G46 1080  7    beginning students of history, went through edition
G46 1090  5    after edition, and continues to be reprinted up to
G46 1100  3    the very present. Its success is a tribute, above all,
G46 1100 13    to Trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist.
G46 1110  7       In 1924 Trevelyan traveled to the United States,
G46 1120  6    where he delivered the Lowell lectures at Harvard University.
G46 1130  5    These lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey
G46 1140  4    of English development which took form afterward as
G46 1150  1    a History of England. In short order, the general history
G46 1150 11    became his most popular work and has remained, aside
G46 1160  9    from his later Social history, the work most widely
G46 1170  6    favored by the public.
G46 1170 10       The History of England has often been compared with
G46 1180  9    Green's Short history. Like Green, Trevelyan aimed
G46 1190  6    to write a history not of "English kings or English
G46 1200  6    conquests", but of the English people. The result was
G46 1210  4    fortunate. The History takes too much for granted to
G46 1220  3    serve as a text for other than English schoolboys,
G46 1220 12    and like Britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates
G46 1230  8    badly as it goes beyond 1870. Trevelyan's excursions
G46 1240  5    into contemporary history were rarely happy ones. But
G46 1250  5    as a stimulating, provocative interpretation of the
G46 1260  3    broad sweep of English development it is incomparable.
G46 1260 11    Living pictures of the early boroughs, country life
G46 1270  8    in Tudor and Stuart times, the impact of the industrial
G46 1280  7    revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language
G46 1290  4    and literature, the common law, parliamentary development.
G46 1300  1    The strength of the History is also its weakness. Trevelyan
G46 1310  1    is militantly sure of the superiority of English institutions
G46 1310 10    and character over those of other peoples. His nationalism
G46 1330  2    was not a new characteristic, but its self-consciousness,
G46 1340  1    even its self-satisfaction, is more obvious in a book
G46 1340 11    that stretches over the long reach of English history.
G46 1350  8    And yet the elements which capture his liberal and
G46 1360  5    humanistic imagination are those which make the English
G46 1370  2    story worth telling and worth remembering. Tolerance
G46 1370  9    and compromise, social justice and civil liberty, are
G46 1380  8    today too often in short supply for one to be overly
G46 1390  7    critical of Trevelyan's emphasis on their central place
G46 1400  4    in the English tradition. Like most major works of
G46 1410  2    synthesis, the History of England is informed by the
G46 1410 11    positive views of a first-class mind, and this is surely
G46 1420 11    a major work.
G46 1430  1       Four years after the publication of the History
G46 1430  9    of England, the first volume of Trevelyan's Queen Anne
G46 1440  7    trilogy appeared. By now he had become Regius Professor
G46 1450  6    of Modern History at Cambridge and had been honored
G46 1460  5    by the award of the Order of Merit. His academic duties
G46 1470  2    had little evident effect on his prolific pen. Blenheim
G46 1480  1    was followed in rapid succession by Ramillies and the
G46 1480 10    union with Scotland and by The peace and the Protestant
G46 1490  9    succession, the three forming together a detailed picture
G46 1500  7    of England under Queen Anne. Like his volume on Wycliffe,
G46 1510  6    the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected
G46 1520  5    group of documents, in this case illustrative of the
G46 1530  3    history of Queen Anne's reign down to 1707.
G46 1530 11       Trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the
G46 1540  9    period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the
G46 1550  6    story where Macaulay's History of England had broken
G46 1560  3    off. In addition, he believed in the "dramatic unity
G46 1570  2    and separateness of the period from 1702-14, lying
G46 1570 11    between the Stuart and Hanoverian eras with a special
G46 1580  7    ethos of its own". He saw the age as one in which Britain
G46 1590  8    "settled her free constitution" and attained her modern
G46 1600  5    place in the world. To most observers, there is little
G46 1610  3    doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of
G46 1610 12    unity upon the years of Anne's reign which in reality
G46 1620  9    existed only in the pages of his history.
G46 1630  4       Of the three volumes, Blenheim is easily the best.
G46 1640  3    In four opening chapters reminiscent of Macaulay's
G46 1640 10    famous third chapter, Trevelyan surveys the state of
G46 1650  8    England at the opening of the eighteenth century. His
G46 1660  6    delightful picture of society and institutions is filled
G46 1670  4    with warm detail that brings the period vividly to
G46 1680  2    life. He tends to underestimate- or perhaps to view
G46 1680 11    charitably- the brutality and the violence of the age,
G46 1690 11    so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages
G46 1700  5    which hazes over some of its sharp reality. Yet as
G46 1710  3    an evocation of time past, there are few such successful
G46 1715  1    portraits in English historical literature. Once the
G46 1720  7    scene is set, Trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense
G46 1730  6    story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory
G46 1740  5    of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy at Blenheim. The
G46 1760  2    account of the battle is, next to his descriptions
G46 1760 11    of Garibaldi's campaigns, Trevelyan's outstanding military
G46 1770  5    narrative. The scene is etched in sharp detail, the
G46 1780  8    military problems brilliantly explained, and the excitement
G46 1790  5    and importance of the battle made evident. If only
G46 1800  3    for this modest masterpiece of military history, Blenheim
G46 1810  1    is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations
G46 1820  1    have perhaps altered our picture of the Marlborough
G46 1820  9    wars.
G46 1830  1       Ramillies and the union with Scotland has fewer
G46 1830  8    high spots than Blenheim and much less of its dramatic
G46 1840  7    unity. Yet in several chapters on Scotland in the eighteenth
G46 1850  6    century, Trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled
G46 1860  4    confusion of Scottish politics against a vivid background
G46 1870  1    of Scottish religion, customs, and traditions.
