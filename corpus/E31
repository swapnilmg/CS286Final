E31 0010  1    THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is
E31 0010 10    now moving into a new era. Modern times have changed
E31 0020  8    the world beyond recognition. The early years of the
E31 0030  6    twentieth century seem very far away. But with all
E31 0040  2    the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few
E31 0040 11    things remain constant, including the devotion of Americans
E31 0050  7    to the great field sports, hunting and fishing.
E31 0060  5       As the generations move on, clothes become more
E31 0070  3    suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting
E31 0080  1    firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern
E31 0080 10    transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered
E31 0090  7    wagon, the demand of today's sportsmen and women has
E31 0100  6    necessitated changes in their equipment.
E31 0110  1       The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers
E31 0110  7    through diligent research and technical development
E31 0120  6    have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot
E31 0130  7    arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders, extremely
E31 0140  2    accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And
E31 0150  1    millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms
E31 0150 11    ammunition, designed for today's hunting and target
E31 0160  7    shooting.
E31 0160  8       And due to modern resource-use and game management
E31 0170  8    practices, there is still game to shoot, even with
E31 0180  6    the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water.
E31 0190  2    Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not
E31 0190  8    as an expendable natural resource, but as an annual
E31 0200  7    harvest to be sown and also reaped. Unlimited game
E31 0210  4    bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states,
E31 0220  1    on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern
E31 0220 11    game-management) for five and six months each year.
E31 0230  8       Close to two million game birds were harvested on
E31 0240  6    1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves, and
E31 0250  3    on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas
E31 0260  1    during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development
E31 0260  9    program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers'
E31 0270  6    Institute has successfully published these facts in
E31 0280  5    all major outdoor magazines, many national weeklies
E31 0290  2    and the trade papers.
E31 0290  6       The most effective way to develop more places for
E31 0300  5    more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed
E31 0310  2    shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director
E31 0320  1    of the shooting development program, the New York staff
E31 0320 10    of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau, and the SAAMI shooting
E31 0330  7    preserve field consultants since the start of the program
E31 0340  9    in 1954.
E31 0340 11       Following the kick-off of SAAMI's shooting development
E31 0350  8    program in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place
E31 0360  9    in Washington, D. C. The group known as the American
E31 0370  7    Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation
E31 0380  4    (a division of the National Education Association)
E31 0390  2    initiated a conference which brought together representatives
E31 0400  1    of the National Rifle Association, SAAMI and the American
E31 0410  1    Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called
E31 0410  8    to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch
E31 0420  9    what is known as the Outdoor Education Project.
E31 0430  5       The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of
E31 0440  4    the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic activities
E31 0450  2    stressed in most school programs have little or no
E31 0450 11    relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests
E31 0460  9    of later life. The various team sports assuredly have
E31 0470  6    their place in every school, and they are important
E31 0480  4    to proper physical development. But with the exception
E31 0490  1    of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical
E31 0490  9    education activities in our schools have any carryover
E31 0500  8    in the adult life of the average American man or woman.
E31 0510  7       Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation
E31 0520  3    and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian
E31 0530  3    Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges
E31 0540  1    and universities have shooting and hunting education
E31 0540  8    in their physical education and recreation programs.
E31 0550  5    SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed
E31 0560  5    to the success of this project in education. Personnel
E31 0570  2    assigned through the shooting development program have
E31 0580  1    proudly participated in over 53 state and regional
E31 0580  9    workshops, at which hundreds of school administrators,
E31 0590  5    teachers, professors, and recreational leaders have
E31 0600  3    been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering that
E31 0610  2    the current school-age potential is 23 million youths,
E31 0610 11    the project and its message on hunting and shooting
E31 0620  8    education have many more to reach.
E31 0630  3       In 1959 SAAMI's shooting development program announced
E31 0640  2    a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age
E31 0640 12    boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the
E31 0650 10    participation in the shooting sports. This program
E31 0660  6    is now nationally known as "Teen Hunter Clubs".
E31 0670  3       Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated
E31 0680  3    members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation. The
E31 0690  2    first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead,
E31 0690 11    New York, under the direction of Special Events director
E31 0700  9    Jennings Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted
E31 0710  7    by A + S, Babylon, New York; J. L. Hudson, Detroit;
E31 0720  7    Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.
E31 0730  1       Other THC activities followed, conducted by shopping
E31 0740  1    centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers,
E31 0740  7    radio-TV stations, newspapers, and other organizations
E31 0750  6    interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters
E31 0760  6    with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development
E31 0770  5    of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting
E31 0780  4    and wise use of our natural resources. SAAMI's field
E31 0790  2    men have served as consultants and/or have participated
E31 0790 10    in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached
E31 0800  9    over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans.
E31 0810  3       Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development
E31 0820  3    program these shooting activities, and many others,
E31 0830  2    including assists in the development of public and
E31 0830 10    privately financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues,
E31 0840  8    rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted,
E31 0850  5    to mention only a few.
E31 0860  1       The continuation and expansion of the shooting development
E31 0860  8    program will assure to some degree that national and
E31 0870  8    community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing
E31 0880  6    need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting
E31 0890  3    and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual
E31 0900  1    sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of
E31 0900 10    our political, social, educational and even religious
E31 0910  6    leaders too often forget it. Help is needed from dealers,
E31 0920  5    at the grass-roots level.
E31 0920 10       The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor
E31 0930  6    a successful promotional program through their industry
E31 0940  4    trade association. Since SAAMI's conception in 1926,
E31 0950  4    and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting
E31 0960  2    Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and
E31 0960 10    promotional man-hours have gone into the development
E31 0970  8    of more places to shoot for more youths and adults.
E31 0980  6    We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition dealer,
E31 0990  2    have benefited through additional sales of equipment.
E31 1000  1       Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports?
E31 1000 10    Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions
E31 1010  8    of American boys and girls, who will grow up to enjoy
E31 1020  8    a traditional American way of life- ranging the fields
E31 1030  6    with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition?
E31 1035  2       Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department
E31 1050  1    primed for the expanding horizons?
E31 1050  6       Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting
E31 1060  6    programs, and have information on seasons including
E31 1070  4    six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting
E31 1080  3    preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter. WE WERE CAMPING a few
E31 1090  6    weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land
E31 1100  3    of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's
E31 1110  1    famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees
E31 1110 10    or hills presents a constant camping show with all
E31 1120  7    manner of equipment in actual use.
E31 1130  2       With the whole camp exposed to view we could see
E31 1130 12    the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are
E31 1140  8    camping now. There were umbrella tents, wall tents,
E31 1150  5    cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup tents, Pop
E31 1160  3    tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper
E31 1160 11    trailers, travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes
E31 1170  9    serving as sunshades over entire family camps.
E31 1180  6       Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves,
E31 1190  6    lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle,
E31 1200  1    windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in
E31 1200  9    the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National
E31 1210  9    Seashore Recreation Area. Dealers would do well to
E31 1220  7    visit such a campground often, look at the equipment
E31 1230  4    and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate
E31 1240  1    the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing
E31 1240  9    the industry.
E31 1250  1       Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows
E31 1250 10    where it will stop. Almost every official who reflects
E31 1260  7    on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings
E31 1270  6    opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets.
E31 1280  4    You read various guesses on how many Americans are
E31 1290  2    camping. The number depends on who is talking at the
E31 1290 12    moment. The figures range as high as 15 million families.
E31 1300  9    I've heard 10 million mentioned often, but I'm more
E31 1310  6    inclined to think there may be a total of some five
E31 1320  5    to seven million families camping. Seven million families
E31 1340  1    would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider
E31 1340  9    the equipment needed to protect this many from the
E31 1350  8    weather, to make their cooking easy and their sleeping
E31 1360  5    comfortable.
E31 1360  6    #MORE CAMPERS THAN CAMPSITES#
E31 1370  1    Harassed state park officials often have more campers
E31 1370  9    than they know what to do with. They are struggling
E31 1380  9    to meet the demand for camping space, but families
E31 1390  4    are being turned away, especially on holiday weekends.
E31 1400  2    The National Parks, always popular camping places,
E31 1400  9    are facing the same pressure. The National Park Service
E31 1410  8    hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for
E31 1420  6    100,000 campers a day- almost twice what there are
E31 1430  5    at present. The U. S. Forest Service cares for hundreds
E31 1440  3    of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests
E31 1450  1    and is increasing its facilities steadily.
E31 1450  7       But the campers still come. They bring their families
E31 1460  6    and tents and camp kitchens and bedding. They bring
E31 1470  3    their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.
E31 1480  1    They come prepared for family fun because Americans
E31 1480  9    in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the
E31 1490  8    way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family
E31 1500  5    experience of lasting importance.
E31 1500  9    #WHY THEY KEEP COMING#
E31 1510  3    There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for
E31 1520  1    the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according
E31 1520  9    to the U. S. Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter
E31 1530  8    work weeks, (2) higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations,
E31 1540  7    (4) better transportation, (5) earlier retirement,
E31 1550  3    and (6) more education. The more people learn about
E31 1560  1    their country, the more they want to learn. Camping
E31 1560 10    is family fun, and it is helping more Americans see
E31 1570  8    more of the country than they ever saw before.
E31 1580  3       But make no mistake about it, the first reason people
E31 1590  2    turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise
E31 1590 13    of a vacation trip they can afford.
E31 1600  5       The American Automobile Association, computing the
E31 1610  3    cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes
E31 1620  1    up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29.
E31 1620 10    The AAA then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals,
E31 1630 10    $9.50 for lodging, $7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips
E31 1640 10    and miscellaneous.
E31 1640 12       What does the camping couple do to this set of figures?
E31 1650 10    The $9.50 for lodging they save. Because they prepare
E31 1660  6    their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good
E31 1670  5    portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of
E31 1680  2    the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the
E31 1680 11    only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or
E31 1690  7    pare down drastically by camping along the way.
E31 1700  4       Where Americans used to think of a single vacation
E31 1710  2    each summer, they now think about how many vacations
E31 1710 11    they can have. Long weekends enable many to get away
E31 1720 10    from home for three or four days several times a year.
E31 1730  7    And even if they stay in resorts part of the time,
E31 1740  4    they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow,
E31 1740 14    develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare
E31 1750  9    with a camping trip into the wide open spaces.
E31 1760  6       It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of
E31 1770  3    beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts
E31 1780  1    of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the
E31 1780 12    comforts of home. They're buying fun and adventure
E31 1790  7    and family experiences. But it would also be a mistake
E31 1800  7    for them not to realize how comfortable camping has
E31 1810  3    become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded
E31 1820  1    logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want
E31 1820  9    comforts, and they have them. And this helps explain
E31 1830  8    why so many people are now going camping. It's fun,
E31 1840  4    and it's easy- so easy that there is time left after
E31 1850  3    cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out
E31 1850 13    and enjoy outdoor fun with their families.
E31 1860  7       Camp meals are no great problem. Neither are beds,
E31 1870  5    thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags. Neither
E31 1880  2    are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs
E31 1880 12    of every camper or prospective camper.
E31 1890  5       But there is still the sometimes complex problem
E31 1900  3    of helping campers choose the best equipment for their
E31 1910  2    individual needs.
