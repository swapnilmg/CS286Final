P09 0010  1    "And I'll take you with me". The two of them against
P09 0010 12    the world. That had been how she imagined it. For when
P09 0020 10    he began to talk and dream all at the same time, making
P09 0030  8    his plans as he went, she had begun dreaming too. But
P09 0040  4    now the dream was over. The big waking up had happened.
P09 0050  1       "What did I imagine"? she thought. "Did I see him
P09 0060  2    about to swing low in a chariot? Or maybe poling up
P09 0060 13    the south fork of the Forked Deer River braving the
P09 0070  9    wastes dumped in it? Maybe I saw him on a barge with
P09 0080  8    a gang of Ethiopians poling it".
P09 0090  1       And I'll take you with me. He had taken her all
P09 0090 12    right. Wednesday nights after youth fellowship. Out
P09 0100  7    of the church and into his big car, it tooling over
P09 0110  7    the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping
P09 0120  2    the pike ahead and after he hit college, his expansiveness,
P09 0130  1    the quaint little pine board tourist courts, cabins
P09 0130  9    really, with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling
P09 0140  8    (unfrosted and naked as a streetlight, like the one
P09 0150  4    on the corner where you used to play when you were
P09 0160  1    a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in after
P09 0160 11    the bugs, watching in between your bouts at hopscotch),
P09 0170  7    a room complete with moths pinging the light and the
P09 0180  5    few casual cockroaches cruising the walls, an insect
P09 0190  1    Highway Patrol with feelers waving. And the bed that
P09 0190 10    sagged in a certain place where all the weight had
P09 0200  9    been put too many times before and the walls fine and
P09 0210  6    thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt
P09 0220  2    went out for ice, the sound coming through the walls
P09 0220 12    like something on the other side of the curtain, so
P09 0230  9    you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while
P09 0240  7    you lay wondering what they had heard you listened.
P09 0250  4       And Gratt Shafer would be in Memphis today for the
P09 0260  3    wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry
P09 0260 11    just like everybody knew he would, just like everybody
P09 0270  8    knew all along. Like Mattie and the mayor up there
P09 0280  7    gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in
P09 0290  3    his office yanking out teeth, like they all knew he
P09 0290 13    would. Just like the balloon would go up and you could
P09 0300 11    sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow
P09 0310  9    to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen.
P09 0320  4    Or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open just
P09 0330  2    so you could say you saw it not open, not because you
P09 0330 14    meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear,
P09 0340  8    but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid-
P09 0350  9    a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might
P09 0360  5    be pregnant, but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone
P09 0370  2    and go on like everything is all right instead of being
P09 0370 13    able to say to somebody in a normal voice: "I think
P09 0380 10    I'm pregnant". You could wish that. Or you could wish
P09 0390  9    your daddy would really do it- kill Gratt Shafer like
P09 0400  7    he said when you all the time, all along, could feel
P09 0410  3    the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured
P09 0420  1    tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining
P09 0420 14    and at night. So you sit in the car and listen to the
P09 0430 11    air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud
P09 0440  7    in front of the headlights, waiting for you, for your
P09 0450  3    new spectator pumps, waiting for you to squat by yourself
P09 0450 13    out there in your tight skirt, crying and afraid and
P09 0460 10    trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off,
P09 0470  7    because that is being an old maid too, if you happen
P09 0480  4    to drive a car, it is changing the tire yourself in
P09 0480 15    the night, and in the mud and the rain, hating to get
P09 0490 12    out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk
P09 0500  9    out for help. And every sound that might be the rain
P09 0510  5    also might be the man who thinks after he has raped
P09 0520  1    you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool
P09 0520 13    so you won't tell, a combination like ham and eggs,
P09 0530  7    rape her and kill her, and that is being an old maid
P09 0540  6    too. It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat
P09 0550  3    against your breast and it is not having somebody that
P09 0550 13    really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your
P09 0560  9    skull. And most of all it is not having the only man
P09 0570  7    you could love, whether he drives a bread truck or
P09 0580  3    delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at
P09 0580 13    the sheds, or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond
P09 0590  9    mines, for if you are anybody what he is or does makes
P09 0600  8    no difference if he is the one. He can even be a mild-voiced
P09 0610  9    little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray
P09 0620  5    eyes and a heart even Houdini couldn't figure out,
P09 0630  2    how it is unlocked. And he can be on the way to Memphis,
P09 0630 15    your Gratt Shafer can, and you discover you can stay
P09 0640 10    alive and hate him and love him and want him even if
P09 0650  8    it means you want him- really want him- dead. Because
P09 0660  3    if you can't then nobody else can either, nobody else
P09 0670  3    can have him. For you don't share him, not even with
P09 0670 14    God. If it is love, you don't.
P09 0680  7       And I'll take you with me. Even if that's all the
P09 0690  6    promise he ever gave or ever will give, the giving
P09 0700  3    of it once was enough and you believed it then and
P09 0700 14    you will always believe it, even when it is finally
P09 0710  9    the only thing in the world you have left to believe,
P09 0720  6    and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie.
P09 0730  4    Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still
P09 0740  1    have the promise resting inside you like a gift, and
P09 0740 11    it is he inside of you. And in a way the promise works
P09 0750 10    out true, for whether he wants you or not, you go with
P09 0760  7    him in your heart. You feel him every mile further
P09 0780  2    away. You feel where he is and what he sees, and at
P09 0780 14    night you feel when he is asleep or with the other
P09 0790 10    woman, the one that never could love him the way you
P09 0800  6    do, the one who got him because she didn't particularly
P09 0810  2    give a damn whether she got him or didn't. And you
P09 0810 13    know you will always wonder all of your life whether
P09 0820 10    it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't
P09 0830  7    get him, and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry
P09 0840  4    when you think of that other guy, the chump who begged
P09 0850  1    you to marry him, the one with the plastered hair and
P09 0850 12    the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes.
P09 0860  7    You think: "Did he feel that way about me"? It comes
P09 0870  7    to you that probably he did feel that way to let you
P09 0880  4    use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer;
P09 0890  1    that he must have since he was there like the radio
P09 0890 12    for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of
P09 0900 11    him, that other guy. It dawns on you that instead of
P09 0910  6    a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from
P09 0920  2    you, he was a man, and that because Gratt Shafer was
P09 0920 13    making you miserable, you were passing it down to him,
P09 0930 10    to Gratt Shafer's substitute, that other guy. And you
P09 0940  7    wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and
P09 0950  6    his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened
P09 0960  2    out and moved to St. Louis, where he got to be a big
P09 0970  1    unhappy success. You wonder if he looks at his wife
P09 0970 11    now and thinks of you. You wonder about the Christmas
P09 0980  7    card with no name on it, and it comes to you that maybe
P09 0990  6    it would have been better to have made somebody else
P09 1000  2    happy if you couldn't be happy yourself, to give somebody
P09 1000 12    else the one they wanted- to give them you.
P09 1010  9       "Damn the world", she thought. She looked out at
P09 1020  7    the corn field, the great green deep acres of it rolled
P09 1030  5    out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed
P09 1040  1    fence bordering the grounds. The mayor envisioned factories
P09 1040  9    there. Homes and factories and schools and a big wide
P09 1050 10    federal highway, instead of peaceful corn to rest your
P09 1060  7    eyes on while you tried to rest your heart, while you
P09 1070  4    tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand
P09 1080  1    and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments.
P09 1080 10    The bands were impatient, but they were the only ones.
P09 1090  7    The others, the ones in the stands, were spellbound,
P09 1100  3    for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to
P09 1110  2    a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York
P09 1110 11    City. It was like being in the concert hall in the
P09 1120  9    afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing.
P09 1130  3    He was good and they knew that what he was doing for
P09 1140  2    them he would do all over the United States some day.
P09 1140 13    So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but
P09 1150 11    on how he said it, not listening exactly, but rather,
P09 1160  5    feeling. If a man was good, if he was going to be governor,
P09 1170  6    you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever. You
P09 1180  2    were sorry when he finished talking because while he
P09 1180 11    was up there you were someone else and the world was
P09 1190 10    something else too. It was a place full of courage
P09 1200  7    and hope and you were part of it. You laughed and then
P09 1210  4    your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a
P09 1210 15    little bit, and then a feeling hit you like a chill
P09 1220 11    in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your
P09 1230  7    arm. He hit the theme about dying to defend your country,
P09 1240  5    and you were ready to do it right then, without a second
P09 1250  3    thought. While he talked you wouldn't trade being a
P09 1250 12    West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the
P09 1260  9    whole damned world, no matter if it hadn't, in six
P09 1270  8    weeks, rained enough to wet a rat's ass.
P09 1280  2       She glanced at the man nodding beside her, a man
P09 1280 12    with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks,
P09 1290  8    with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts
P09 1300  4    he had seen, reflecting the sky and the drought which
P09 1310  2    must follow now in August- yes, with eyes predicting
P09 1310 11    the drought and here it was only June, only festival
P09 1320 10    time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave
P09 1330  7    her. "I should have stayed at the store", she thought.
P09 1340  5       Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids,
P09 1350  5    back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four,
P09 1360  3    which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal
P09 1360 13    working conditions, like the unventilated toilet with
P09 1370  7    the door you had to hold shut while you sat down. There
P09 1380  9    was no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock. A lock
P09 1390  6    on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping.
P09 1400  3    The toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years
P09 1400 12    and there were things written on the walls of the little
P09 1410 11    boxed-in place because you couldn't keep the public
P09 1420  7    out- entirely. She could not count the times Herman
P09 1430  5    had rapped on the door, just a couple of bangs that
P09 1440  2    shook the whole damned closet and might, someday, break
P09 1440 11    away the pipe connections from the wall. The two little
P09 1450  9    bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a
P09 1460  7    crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to
P09 1470  5    he would jerk open the door and drag out, by the opposite
P09 1480  1    door handle which she would be clutching, whichever-the-hell
P09 1480 11    clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store
P09 1490 10    time on the pot.
P09 1500  1       And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until
P09 1500 11    eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales, and
P09 1510  7    there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the
P09 1520  4    cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or
P09 1530  2    janitor.
