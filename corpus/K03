K03 0010  1    MICKIE SAT over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a
K03 0010 12    little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania
K03 0020  7    Avenue. Al's Little Cafe was small, dark, narrow, and
K03 0030  6    filled with the mingled scent of beer, tobacco smoke,
K03 0040  3    and Italian cooking. Hanging over the bar was an oil
K03 0050  1    painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at
K03 0050 12    the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and
K03 0060  9    was broke. The nude was small and black-haired and
K03 0070  5    elfin, and was called "Eloise".
K03 0070 10       This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink
K03 0080 11    in a back booth without anyone noticing him, or at
K03 0090  6    least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know
K03 0100  4    all the low-down. The other patrons were taxi drivers
K03 0110  1    and art students and small shopkeepers. The reporters
K03 0110  9    had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway.
K03 0120  7       His friend Jane was with him. She was wise enough
K03 0140  6    to realize a man could be good company even if he did
K03 0150  4    weigh too much and didn't own the mint. She was the
K03 0150 15    widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash,
K03 0160 11    and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical
K03 0170  9    section of the Treasury. This meant sorting out press
K03 0180  5    clippings and the like.
K03 0180  9       Jane sat receptive and interested. Mickie had a
K03 0190  6    pleasant glow as he said, "You see, both of them, I
K03 0200  5    mean the President and Jeff Lawrence, are romantics.
K03 0210  1    A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely
K03 0210 11    inspired and all he has to do is find the right key,
K03 0220 11    and then divine justice and altruism will appear. It's
K03 0230  5    like focusing a camera; the distant ship isn't there
K03 0240  3    until you get the focus. You know what I'm talking
K03 0250  1    about. I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until
K03 0250 12    they live with them.
K03 0260  3       "But when it comes to war, the Colonel knows what
K03 0270  1    it is and Jeff doesn't. Mr. Christiansen knows that
K03 0270 10    a soldier will get the Distinguished Service Medal
K03 0280  7    for conduct that would land him in prison for life
K03 0290  6    or the electric chair as a civilian. He had a mean,
K03 0300  3    unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit, and someone invented
K03 0300 12    the name Trig for him. That's to say, he was trigger
K03 0310 11    happy. He'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end
K03 0320 10    of a horse or his own sentry. He was a wiry, inscrutable,
K03 0330  6    silent country boy from the red clay of rural Alabama,
K03 0340  3    and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally
K03 0350  1    make fun of. But not in front of Trig. I heard of some
K03 0350 14    that tried it back in the States, and he'd knock them
K03 0360 10    clear across the room. There'd been a pretty bad incident
K03 0370  7    back at the Marine base. A New York kid, a refugee
K03 0380  5    from one of the Harlem gangs, made fun of Trig's accent,
K03 0390  2    and drew a knife. Before the fight was over, the Harlem
K03 0400  1    boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly. They
K03 0400 12    caught Trig stealing liquor from the officers' mess,
K03 0410  7    and he got a couple of girls in trouble. The fear of
K03 0420  6    punishment just didn't bother him. It wasn't there.
K03 0430  2    It was left out of him at birth. This is why he made
K03 0430 15    such a magnificent soldier. He wasn't troubled with
K03 0440  8    the ordinary, rank-and-file fear that overcomes and
K03 0450  5    paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies
K03 0460  4    under fire running in panic. It just didn't occur to
K03 0470  3    Trig that anything serious would happen to him. Do
K03 0470 12    you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was"?
K03 0480 10       Jane nodded with a pleasant smile.
K03 0490  5       "All right. There was a sniper's nest in a mountain
K03 0500  4    cave, and it was picking off our men with devilish
K03 0500 14    accuracy. The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out,
K03 0510  9    and I suggested, 'You ask for volunteers, and promise
K03 0520  7    each man on the patrol a quart of whisky, ten dollars
K03 0530  5    and a week-end pass to Davao'. Trig was one of the
K03 0540  4    five volunteers. The patrol snaked around in back of
K03 0540 13    the cave, approached it from above and dropped in suddenly
K03 0550  9    with wild howls. You could hear them from our outpost.
K03 0560  8    There was a lot of shooting. We knew the enemy was
K03 0570  6    subdued, because a flare was fired as the signal. So
K03 0580  2    we hurried over. Two of our men were killed, a third
K03 0580 13    was wounded. Trig and a very black colored boy from
K03 0590  9    Detroit had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas
K03 0600  6    by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting. When we got
K03 0610  3    there, Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession
K03 0620  1    of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino.
K03 0620 12    The colored boy had it, and Trig lunged at him with
K03 0630 10    a knife and said, 'Give that to me, you black bastard.
K03 0640  7    We don't 'low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with
K03 0650  5    white men where I come from'.
K03 0650 11       "The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the
K03 0660 11    knife wound".
K03 0670  1       "What did the Colonel do about the men"? Jane asked
K03 0670 10    in her placid, interested way.
K03 0680  3       Mickie laughed. "He recommended both of them for
K03 0690  3    the DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart,
K03 0700  1    too, for a combat-inflicted wound. So you see Mr. Christiansen
K03 0710  1    knows what it's all about. But not Jeff Lawrence. When
K03 0710 11    he was in the war, he was in Law or Supplies or something
K03 0720 11    like that, and an old buddy of his told me he would
K03 0730  9    come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations
K03 0740  5    for medals- just like the one we sent in for Trig-
K03 0750  1    and go away with a real glow. These were heroes nine
K03 0750 12    feet tall to him".
K03 0760  4    ##
K03 0760  5    Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small, perfectly
K03 0770  1    appointed table by the window looking out over the
K03 0770 10    river. He had dinner and sat there over his coffee
K03 0780  9    watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed
K03 0790  6    the bridge and spread out like a serpent with two heads.
K03 0800  3    Open beside him was Mrs. Dalloway. He thought how this
K03 0810  2    dainty, fragile older woman threading her way through
K03 0810 10    the streets of Westminster on a day in June, enjoying
K03 0820  9    the flowers in the shops, the greetings from old friends,
K03 0830  6    but never really drawing a deep, passionate breath,
K03 0840  2    was so like himself. He, and Mrs. Dalloway, too, had
K03 0850  2    never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that
K03 0850 10    dug into the bone marrow of the spirit.
K03 0860  6       He had not because he was both poor and ambitious.
K03 0870  3    Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious.
K03 0880  1    They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the
K03 0880 12    back seat of cars along a dark country lane. No, they
K03 0890  8    must look the other way and climb one more painful
K03 0900  4    step up the ladder. He made the decision with his eyes
K03 0910  2    open, or so he thought. At any cost, he must leave
K03 0910 13    the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father
K03 0920  6    was a pharmacist. And so he had, so he had. At State
K03 0930  7    College, he had no time to walk among the violets on
K03 0940  3    the water's edge. From his room he could look out in
K03 0940 14    springtime and see the couples hand in hand walking
K03 0950  9    slowly, deliciously, across the campus, and he could
K03 0960  7    smell the sweet vernal winds. He was not stone. He
K03 0970  4    was not unmoved. He had to teach himself patiently
K03 0970 13    that these traps were not for him. He must mentally
K03 0980 10    pull the blinds and close the window, so that all that
K03 0990  8    existed was in the books before him. At law school,
K03 1000  4    the same. More of this stamping down of human emotion
K03 1010  1    as a young lawyer in New York. By the time he was prosperous
K03 1010 14    enough- his goals were high- he was bald and afraid
K03 1020 12    of women. The only one who would have him was his cripple,
K03 1030  9    the strange unhappy woman who became his wife. Perhaps
K03 1040  6    it was right; perhaps it was just. He had dared to
K03 1050  4    defy nature, to turn his back to the Lorelei, and he
K03 1050 15    was punished. Like Mrs. Dalloway, with her regrets
K03 1060  8    about Peter Walsh, he had his moments of melancholy
K03 1070  7    over a youth too well spent. If he had had a son, he
K03 1080  7    would tell him, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may ...
K03 1090  3    This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be
K03 1090 12    dying". But then his son could afford it.
K03 1100  8       Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell. The Vice President
K03 1110  5    had called and asked if he could see the Secretary
K03 1120  3    at his home. He said the matter was urgent. The Secretary
K03 1130  1    was uneasy about the visit. He did not like Boxell.
K03 1130 11    He suspected something underhanded and furtive about
K03 1140  6    him. Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely,
K03 1150  7    and this worried him. When you disliked or distrusted
K03 1160  3    a man, you should have a reason. Human nature was not
K03 1170  2    a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell.
K03 1170 14    Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic,
K03 1180  9    hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President
K03 1190  6    would appear. It did not. Therefore, he decided he
K03 1200  4    was unfair to the young man and should make an effort
K03 1210  1    to understand and sympathize with his point of view.
K03 1210 10       A half hour later the Vice President arrived. He
K03 1220  8    looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing,
K03 1230  5    as though hoping to store this information carefully
K03 1240  2    in his mind. He observed the Florentine vase in the
K03 1240 12    hall, the Renoir painting in the library, as well as
K03 1250 10    the long shelves of well-bound volumes; the pattern
K03 1260  4    of the Oriental rug, the delicate cut-glass chandelier.
K03 1270  2       He said to the Secretary, "I understand you came
K03 1280  3    from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre.
K03 1280 11    How did you find out about this"? He waved his arm
K03 1290 10    around at the furnishings.
K03 1300  1       It was not a discourteous question, Lawrence decided.
K03 1310  1    This young man had so little time to learn he had to
K03 1310 13    be curious; he had to find out. The Secretary did not
K03 1320 10    tell him at what cost, at what loneliness, he learned
K03 1330  5    these things. He merely said, "Any good decorator these
K03 1340  3    days can make you a tasteful home".
K03 1340 10       The Vice President said, "If you hear of any names
K03 1350  9    that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they
K03 1360  6    decorated the Vice President's home, let me know. I
K03 1370  6    can do business with that kind".
K03 1370 12       Again, Lawrence thought a little sadly, these were
K03 1380  8    the fees of poverty and ambition. Boxell did not have
K03 1390  6    the chance to grow up graciously. He had to acquire
K03 1400  4    everything he was going to get in four years.
K03 1400 13       They had brandy in the library. Boxell looked at
K03 1410  9    Lawrence with a searching glance, the kind that a prosecuting
K03 1430  7    attorney would give a man on trial. What are your weaknesses?
K03 1440  5    Where will you break? How best to destroy your peace?
K03 1450  4       The Vice President said with a slight bluster, "There
K03 1460  3    isn't anyone who loves the President more than I do.
K03 1470  3    Old Chris is my ideal. At the same time, you have to
K03 1470 15    face facts and realize that a man who's been in the
K03 1480 10    Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about
K03 1490  6    politics. What does a monk know about sex"?
K03 1500  3       Lawrence listened with the practiced, deceptive
K03 1510  1    calm of the lawyer, but his face was in the shadow.
K03 1510 12       "So, we have to protect the old man for his own
K03 1520 11    good. You see what I mean. Congress is full of politicians,
K03 1530  6    and if you want to get along with them, you have to
K03 1540  5    be politic. This is why I say we just can't go ahead
K03 1550  1    and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses.
K03 1550 11    Let me tell you what happened to me today. A fellow
K03 1560  9    came up to me, a Senator, I don't have to tell you
K03 1570  7    his name, and he told me, 'I love the President like
K03 1580  3    a brother, but God damn it, he's crucifying me. I've
K03 1590  1    got a quarter of a million Germans in my state, and
K03 1590 12    those krautheads tune in on Father Werther every night,
K03 1600  8    and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public
K03 1610  8    square, that's what they do. He's telling them now
K03 1620  4    to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the
K03 1620 12    disarmament of Germany'. And another one comes to me
K03 1630  9    and he says, 'Look here, there's a mill in my state
K03 1640  8    employs five thousand people making uniforms for the
K03 1650  5    Navy.
