K21 0010  1       Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel. He had
K21 0010 10    thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would
K21 0020  8    tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own
K21 0030  5    order, but the slip of paper was folded and absently
K21 0040  1    thrust into the colonel's belt. Despite his yearning,
K21 0040  9    the colonel would not go down to see the men come through
K21 0050 11    the lines. He would remain in the tent, waiting impatiently,
K21 0060  7    occupied by some trivial task.
K21 0070  1       -Beckworth.
K21 0070  2       -Sir?
K21 0070  2       -Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies
K21 0080  8    have requisitioned in the last six months.
K21 0090  2       -The last six months, sir?
K21 0090  6       -You heard me. There's a lot of waste going on here.
K21 0100 11    It's got to stop. I want to take a look. This is no
K21 0110 10    damned holiday, Beckworth. Get busy.
K21 0120  1       -Yes, sir.
K21 0120  2       Beckworth left the tent. Below he could see the
K21 0130  5    bright torches lighting the riverbank. He glanced back.
K21 0140  1    The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding
K21 0140 10    chairs, methodically tearing at his thumbnail.
K21 0150  5    #@ 9 @#
K21 0150  8    THE BOMBPROOF was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy
K21 0160  7    timbers covered with earth. It stood some fifty paces
K21 0170  5    from the edge of the bank. From the outside, it seemed
K21 0180  2    no more than a low drumlin, a lump on the dark earth.
K21 0180 14    A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor. Two slits
K21 0190 10    enabled observers to watch across the river. The place
K21 0200  6    smelled strongly of rank, fertile earth, rotting wood
K21 0210  3    and urine. The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's
K21 0220  1    boots. At least the Union officer had been decent enough
K21 0220 11    to provide a candle. There was no place to sit, but
K21 0230 10    Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window
K21 0240  7    slits and back, stooping slightly to avoid striking
K21 0250  2    his head on the heavy beams. In the corner was the
K21 0250 13    soldier with the white flag. He stood stiffly erect,
K21 0260  9    clutching the staff, his body half hidden by the limp
K21 0270  7    cloth. Watson hardly looked at him. The man had come
K21 0280  4    floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last
K21 0290  1    instant, brandishing the flag of truce. Someone had
K21 0290  9    hauled him over the side, and he had remained silent
K21 0300  8    while they crossed.
K21 0300 11       An officer with a squad of men had been waiting
K21 0310  9    on the bank. The men in the boats had started yelling
K21 0320  5    happily at first sight of the officer, two of them
K21 0330  3    calling him Billy. When the boat had touched, the weaker
K21 0330 13    ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and
K21 0340 11    carried away by the soldiers. Watson had presented
K21 0360  5    his pouch and been led to the bombproof. The officer
K21 0370  3    had told him that both lists must be checked. Watson
K21 0380  1    had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass.
K21 0380 12    The officer, surprised, said he would have to see.
K21 0390  7    Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would
K21 0400  4    check the lists himself later. He had peered through
K21 0410  1    the darkness at the rampart. The men he would take
K21 0410 11    back across the river stood there, but he turned away
K21 0420  9    from them. He wanted no part of the emotions of the
K21 0430  6    exchange, no memory of the joy and gratitude that other
K21 0440  3    men felt. He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof,
K21 0440 14    but the soldier had followed him. Though Watson carefully
K21 0450  8    ignored the man, he could not deny his presence. Perhaps
K21 0460  8    it would be better to speak to him, since silence could
K21 0470  6    not exorcise his form. Watson glanced briefly at him,
K21 0480  3    seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid
K21 0480 12    banner.
K21 0490  2       -We won't be too long. If my pass is approved, I
K21 0490 13    may be a half hour.
K21 0500  5       The soldier answered in a curious, muffled voice,
K21 0510  1    his lips barely moving. Watson turned away and did
K21 0510 10    not see the man's knees buckle and his body sag.
K21 0520  6       -Yes, sir.
K21 0520  8       He had acknowledged the man. It was easier to think
K21 0530 10    now, Watson decided. The stiff figure in the corner
K21 0540  7    no longer blocked his thoughts. He paced slowly, stooping,
K21 0550  4    staring at the damp, slippery floor. He tried to order
K21 0560  3    the words of the three Union officers, seeking to create
K21 0560 13    some coherent portrait of the dead boy. But he groped
K21 0570 10    blindly. His lack of success steadily eroded his interest.
K21 0580  7    He stopped pacing, leaned against the dank, timbered
K21 0590  5    wall and let his mind drift. A feeling of futility,
K21 0600  2    an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had
K21 0600 12    ever known, seeped through him. What in the name of
K21 0610  9    God was he doing, crouched in a timbered pit on the
K21 0620  7    wrong bank of the river? Why had he crossed the dark
K21 0630  3    water, to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers
K21 0630 12    or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole?
K21 0640  8       He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at
K21 0650  5    that emotion. He was conscious of a growing sense of
K21 0660  2    absurdity. Hillman had written it all out, hadn't he?
K21 0660 11    Wasn't the report official enough? What did he hope
K21 0670  9    to accomplish here? Hillman had ordered him not to
K21 0680  7    leave the far bank. Prompted by a guilty urge, he had
K21 0690  6    disobeyed the order of a man he respected. For what?
K21 0700  2    To tell John something he would find out for himself.
K21 0710  1       The figure in the corner belched loudly, a deep,
K21 0710 10    liquid eruption. Watson snorted and then laughed aloud.
K21 0720  6    Exactly!
K21 0720  7       The soldier's voice was muffled again, stricken
K21 0730  6    with chagrin. He clutched the staff, and his dark eyes
K21 0740  5    blinked apologetically.
K21 0740  6       -'Scuse me, sir.
K21 0750  1       -Let's get out of here.
K21 0750  5       Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second
K21 0760  6    sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river
K21 0770  3    weeds. To his left, the two skiffs dented their sharp
K21 0770 13    bows into the soft bank. The flat-bottomed boat swung
K21 0780 10    slowly to the pull of the current. A soldier held the
K21 0790  8    end of a frayed rope.
K21 0790 13       Three Union guards appeared, carrying their rifles
K21 0800  7    at ready. Watson stared at them curiously. They were
K21 0810  4    stocky men, well fed and clean-shaven, with neat uniforms
K21 0820  3    and sturdy boots. Behind them shambled a long column
K21 0820 12    of weak, tattered men. The thin gray figures raised
K21 0830  9    a hoarse, cawing cry like the call of a bird flock.
K21 0840  8    They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness,
K21 0850  2    elbowing and shoving. Four men were knocked down, but
K21 0860  1    did not attempt to rise. They crept down the muddy
K21 0860 11    slope toward the waiting boats. The Union soldiers
K21 0870  6    grounded arms and settled into healthy, indifferent
K21 0880  2    postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs.
K21 0890  1    The crawling men tried to rise and fell again. No one
K21 0890 12    moved to them. Watson watched two of them flounder
K21 0900  7    into the shallow water and listened to their voices
K21 0910  4    beg shrilly. In a confused, soaked and stumbling shift
K21 0920  2    of bodies and lifting arms, the two men were dragged
K21 0920 12    into the same skiff. The third crawling man forced
K21 0930  8    himself erect. He swayed like a drunkard, his arms
K21 0940  6    milling in slow circles. He paced forward unsteadily,
K21 0950  1    leaning too far back, his head tilted oddly. His steps
K21 0950 11    were short and stiff, and, with his head thrown back,
K21 0960 10    his progress was a supercilious strut. He appeared
K21 0970  5    to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded
K21 0980  4    and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom.
K21 0980 13    He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the
K21 0990 10    side of the flat-bottomed barge, his weight nearly
K21 1000  5    swamping the craft. Watson looked for the fourth man.
K21 1010  4    He had reached the three passive guards; he crept in
K21 1020  2    an incertain manner, patting the ground before him.
K21 1020 10    The guards did not look at him. The figure on the earth
K21 1030 10    halted, seemingly bewildered. He sank back on his thin
K21 1040  7    haunches like a weary hound. Then he began to crawl
K21 1050  3    again. Watson watched the creeping figure. He felt
K21 1050 11    a spectator interest. Would the man make it or not?
K21 1060  9    If only there was a clock for him to crawl against.
K21 1070  7    If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes,
K21 1080  4    say, then the skiffs would pull away and leave him
K21 1080 14    groping in the mud. Say three minutes to make it sporting.
K21 1090 11    Still the guards did not move, but stood inert, aloof
K21 1100  8    from the slow-scrambling man. The figure halted, and
K21 1110  5    Watson gasped. The man began to creep in the wrong
K21 1120  3    direction, deceived by a slight rise in the ground!
K21 1120 12    He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank
K21 1130 10    toward the rampart. Watson raced for him, his boots
K21 1140  6    slamming the soft earth.
K21 1140 10       The guards came to life with astonishing menace.
K21 1150  7    They spun and flung their rifles up. Watson gesticulated
K21 1160  4    wildly. One man dropped to his knee for better aim.
K21 1170  2       -Let me help him, for the love of God!
K21 1180  1       The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles
K21 1180  9    and peered at Watson with sullen, puzzled faces. Watson
K21 1190  6    pounded to the crawling man and stopped, panting heavily.
K21 1200  4    He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's
K21 1210  3    upper arm. Beneath his clutch, a flat strip of muscle
K21 1210 13    surged on the bone. Watson bent awkwardly and lifted
K21 1220  9    the man to his feet. Watson stared into a cadaverous
K21 1230  6    face. Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between
K21 1240  5    fiery lids. Light sticks of fingers, the tips gummy
K21 1250  2    with dark earth, patted at Watson's throat. The man's
K21 1250 11    voice was a sweet, patient whisper.
K21 1260  5       -Henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right
K21 1270  7    there. But you ain't Henry.
K21 1270 11       -No.
K21 1280  2       -It don't matter. Is it far?
K21 1280  8       How far could it be, Watson thought bleakly, how
K21 1290  7    far can a blind man crawl? Another body length or all
K21 1300  5    the rest of his nighted life?
K21 1300 10       -Not far.
K21 1310  1       -You talk deep. Not like us fellas. It raises the
K21 1310 10    voice, bein in camp. You Secesh?
K21 1320  5       -Yes. Come on, now. Can you walk?
K21 1330  2       -Why, course I can. I can walk real good.
K21 1340  1       Watson stumbled down the bank. The man leaned his
K21 1340 10    frail body against Watson's shoulder. He was no heavier
K21 1350  8    than a child. Watson paused for breath. The man wheezed
K21 1360  7    weakly, his fetid breath beating softly against Watson's
K21 1370  4    neck. His sweet whisper came after great effort.
K21 1380  2       -Oh, Christ ... I wish you was Henry ... He promised
K21 1390  1    to take me.
K21 1390  3       -Hush. We're almost there.
K21 1390  7       Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank
K21 1400 10    and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest
K21 1420  7    skiff. The man swayed on a thwart, turning his ruined
K21 1430  3    eyes from side to side. Watson turned away, sickened
K21 1430 12    for the first time in many months. He heard the patient
K21 1440 11    voice calling.
K21 1450  2       -Henry? Where are you, Henry?
K21 1450  6       -Make him lie down!
K21 1460  2       Watson snatched a deep breath. He had not meant
K21 1460 11    to shout. He stood with his back to the skiff. The
K21 1470 10    men mewed and scratched, begging to be taken away.
K21 1480  6    Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked
K21 1490  2    with pine-knot torches.
K21 1490  5       -Goddamn you! What do you do to them?
K21 1500  6       Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly. He was angry,
K21 1510  4    sickened. He had not felt that during the afternoon.
K21 1520  1    No, nor later. All his emotions had been inward, self-conscious.
K21 1520 12    In war, on a night like this, it was only the outward
K21 1530 12    emotions that mattered, what could be flung out into
K21 1540  7    the darkness to damage others. Yes. That was it. He
K21 1550  5    was sure of it.
K21 1550  9       John's type of man allowed this sort of thing to
K21 1560  6    happen. What a fool he had been to think of his brother!
K21 1570  3    So Charles was dead. What did it matter? His name had
K21 1580  2    been crossed off a list. Already his cool body lay
K21 1580 12    in the ground. What words had any meaning? What had
K21 1590  8    he thought of, to go to John, grovel and beg understanding?
K21 1600  5    To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu, gouging
K21 1610  5    at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him
K21 1620  2    rise and go? Men were slaughtered every day, tumbled
K21 1620 11    into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down
K21 1630  8    a portable chute. What made him think John had a right
K21 1640  7    to witness his brother's humiliation? What right had
K21 1650  4    John to any special consideration? Was John better,
K21 1660  1    more deserving? To hell with John. Let him chafe with
K21 1660 11    impatience to see Charles, rip open the note with trembling
K21 1670 10    hands and read the formal report in Hillman's beautiful,
K21 1680  7    schoolmaster's hand. John would curse. He believed
K21 1690  5    that brave boys didn't cry.
K21 1690 10       Watson spat on the ground. He was grimly satisfied.
K21 1700  9    He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his
K21 1710  6    brother's pain. Now he knew perfectly that he had but
K21 1720  5    longed to increase his own suffering.
