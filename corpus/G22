G22 0010  1       DOES our society have a runaway, uncontrollable
G22 0010  8    growth of technology which may end our civilization,
G22 0020  7    or a normal, healthy growth? Here there may be an analogy
G22 0030  7    with cancer: we can detect cancers by their rapidly
G22 0040  4    accelerating growth, determinable only when related
G22 0050  1    to the more normal rate of healthy growth. Should the
G22 0050 11    accelerating growth of technology then warn us? Noting
G22 0060  8    such evidence is the first step; and almost the only
G22 0070  6    "cure" is early detection and removal. One way to determine
G22 0080  5    whether we have so dangerous a technology would be
G22 0090  3    to check the strength of our society's organs to see
G22 0090 13    if their functioning is as healthy as before. So an
G22 0100  9    objective look at our present procedures may move us
G22 0110  6    to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation.
G22 0120  2    In any event, whether society may have cancer, or merely
G22 0130  1    a virus infection, the "disease", we shall find, is
G22 0130 10    political, economical, social, and even medical. Have
G22 0140  7    not our physical abilities already deteriorated because
G22 0150  4    of the more sedentary lives we are now living? Hence
G22 0160  3    the prime issue, as I see it, is whether a democratic
G22 0170  1    or free society can master technology for the benefit
G22 0170 10    of mankind, or whether technology will rule and develop
G22 0180  8    its own society compatible with its own needs as a
G22 0190  7    force of nature.
G22 0190 10       We are already committed to establishing man's supremacy
G22 0200  5    over nature and everywhere on earth, not merely in
G22 0210  6    the limited social-political-economical context we
G22 0220  2    are fond of today. Otherwise, we go on endlessly trying
G22 0220 12    to draw the line, color and other, as to which kind
G22 0230 10    of man we wish to see dominate. We have proved so able
G22 0240  6    to solve technological problems that to contend we
G22 0250  3    cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future
G22 0250 12    is to be extremely shortsighted, if nothing else. We
G22 0260  9    must believe we have the ability to affect our own
G22 0270  7    destinies: otherwise why try anything? So in these
G22 0280  4    pages the term "technology" is used to include any
G22 0290  1    and all means which could amplify, project, or augment
G22 0290 10    man's control over himself and over other men. Naturally
G22 0300  8    this includes all communication forms, e.g. languages,
G22 0310  4    or any social, political, economic or religious structures
G22 0320  4    employed for such control. Properly mindful of all
G22 0330  3    the cultures in existence today throughout the world,
G22 0330 11    we must employ these resources without war or violent
G22 0340  8    revolution.
G22 0350  1       If we were creating a wholly new society, we could
G22 0350 10    insist that our social, political, economic and philosophic
G22 0360  5    institutions foster rather than hamper man; best growth.
G22 0370  5    But we cannot start off with a clean slate. So we must
G22 0380  4    first analyze our present institutions with respect
G22 0380 11    to the effect of each on man's major needs. Asked which
G22 0390 11    institution most needs correction, I would say the
G22 0400  8    corporation as it exists in America today. At first
G22 0410  4    glance this appears strange: of all people, was not
G22 0430  3    America founded by rugged individualists who established
G22 0430 10    a new way of life still inspiring "undeveloped" societies
G22 0440  8    abroad? But hear Harrison E. Salisbury, former Moscow
G22 0450  7    correspondent of The New York Times, and author of
G22 0460  7    "To Moscow- And Beyond". In a book review of "The Soviet
G22 0470  8    Cultural Offensive", he says, "Long before the State
G22 0480  5    Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West
G22 0490  4    Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive
G22 0500  1    within Soviet borders, the sharp cutting-edge of American
G22 0510  1    culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes,
G22 0510 10    as when the enterprising promoters of 'Porgy and Bess'
G22 0520  6    overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary
G22 0530  5    'cultural warfare' behind the enemy lines. They were
G22 0540  5    not diplomats or jazz musicians, or even organizers
G22 0550  1    of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays, but rugged
G22 0550 10    capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Hugh Cooper,
G22 0560  7    Thomas Campbell, the International Harvester Co., and
G22 0570  6    David W. Griffith. Their kind created an American culture
G22 0580  6    superior to any in the world, an industrial and technological
G22 0590  4    culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every
G22 0600  3    corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal
G22 0610  1    treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive
G22 0610  9    directives or program a series of consultations of
G22 0620  7    interested agencies. This favorable image of America
G22 0630  4    in the minds of Russian men and women is still there
G22 0640  2    despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda
G22 0640  9    ..."
G22 0650  1    #CORPORATIONS NOW OUTMODED#
G22 0650  4    Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business
G22 0660  3    stems from the fact that the "rugged capitalist entrepreneur"
G22 0670  1    no more exists in America. In his stead is a milquetoast
G22 0680  1    version known as "the corporation". But even if we
G22 0680 10    cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new
G22 0690  7    image of America, foreigners can; and our loss of "prestige"
G22 0700  7    abroad is the direct result. No amount of ballyhoo
G22 0710  5    will cover up the sordid facts. If we want respect
G22 0720  1    from ourselves or others, we will have to earn it.
G22 0720 11    First, let us realize that whatever good this set-up
G22 0730  8    achieved in earlier times, now the corporation per
G22 0740  4    se cannot take economic leadership. Businesses must
G22 0750  2    develop as a result of the ideas, energies and ambitions
G22 0750 12    of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability
G22 0760  7    within one mind. When we "forced" individuals to assume
G22 0770  7    the corporate structure by means of taxes and other
G22 0780  7    legal statutes, we adopted what I would term "pseudo-capitalism"
G22 0790  4    and so took a major step toward socialism. The biggest
G22 0800  3    loss, of course, was the individual's lessened desire
G22 0810  1    and ability to give his services to the growth of his
G22 0810 12    company and our economy. Socialism, I grant, has a
G22 0820  8    definite place in our society. But let us not complain
G22 0830  6    of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that
G22 0840  4    is not truly capitalistic. Some forms of capitalism
G22 0840 12    do indeed work- superb organizations, a credit to any
G22 0850  7    society. But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our
G22 0860  4    whole economy as well as our politics and social life,
G22 0870  4    will not stand close scrutiny. Its pretense to operate
G22 0880  1    in the public interest is little more than a sham.
G22 0880 11    It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that.
G22 0890  9    As a creative enterprise, its abilities are primarily
G22 0900  5    in "swallowing" creative enterprises developed outside
G22 0910  3    its own organization (an ability made possible by us,
G22 0920  2    and almost mandatory). As to benefits to employees,
G22 0920 10    it is notorious for its callous disregard except where
G22 0930  7    it depends on them for services.
G22 0940  1       The corporation in America is in reality our form
G22 0940 10    of socialism, vying in a sense with the other socialistic
G22 0950  9    form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy.
G22 0960  4    But while the corporation has all the disadvantages
G22 0970  3    of the socialist form of organization (so cumbersome
G22 0980  1    it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible
G22 0980 10    with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its
G22 0990  8    status quo), unluckily it does not have the desirable
G22 1000  6    aspect of socialism, the motivation to operate for
G22 1010  2    the benefit of society as a whole. So we are faced
G22 1010 13    with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating
G22 1020  7    themselves in whatever manner they can, without regard
G22 1030  6    to the needs of society, controlling society and forcing
G22 1040  4    upon it a regime representing only the corporation's
G22 1050  1    needs for survival.
G22 1050  4       The corporation has a limited, specific place in
G22 1060  3    our society. Ideally speaking, it should be allowed
G22 1060 11    to operate only where the public has a great stake
G22 1070  9    in the continuity of supply or services, and where
G22 1080  5    the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to
G22 1090  2    the needs of society. Examples are in public utilities,
G22 1090 11    making military aircraft and accessories, or where
G22 1100  7    the investment and risk for a proprietorship would
G22 1110  5    be too great for a much needed project impossible to
G22 1120  2    achieve by any means other than the corporate form,
G22 1120 11    e.g. constructing major airports or dams. Thus, if
G22 1130  8    corporations are not to run away with us, they must
G22 1140  8    become quasi-governmental institutions, subject to
G22 1150  3    public control and needs. In all other areas, private
G22 1150 12    initiative of the "proprietorship" type should be urged
G22 1160  8    to produce the desired goods and services.
G22 1170  5    #PROPRIETORSHIP#
G22 1170  6    Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring
G22 1180  8    a humane society; and for this human beings must be
G22 1190  5    firmly in control of the economics on which our society
G22 1200  2    rests. Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship
G22 1200  9    can offer, corporations cannot. It can project long-range
G22 1210  9    goals for itself. Corporations react violently to short-range
G22 1220  7    stimuli, e. g., quarterly and annual dividend reports.
G22 1230  6    Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity
G22 1240  5    of control; corporations, being more amorphous, cannot.
G22 1250  2    Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity,
G22 1250  8    representing a human personality, and thus establish
G22 1260  7    sincere relationships with customers and community.
G22 1270  4    Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal, inhumane,
G22 1280  2    shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated,
G22 1290  1    a picture they could scarcely afford to present to
G22 1290 10    the public. The proprietor is able to create a leadership
G22 1300  8    impossible in the corporate structure with its board
G22 1310  5    of directors and stockholders. Leadership is lacking
G22 1320  2    in our society because it has no legitimate place to
G22 1320 12    develop. Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises
G22 1330  9    can acquire experiences of the most varied, complicated
G22 1340  6    and trying type so that at maturation they have developed
G22 1350  4    the competence and willingness to accept the personal
G22 1360  3    responsibility so sorely needed now.
G22 1360  8       Hence government must establish greater controls
G22 1370  5    upon corporations so that their activities promote
G22 1380  3    what is deemed essential to the national interest.
G22 1390  1    Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing
G22 1390  9    to corporations, e. g. the chance to accumulate capital
G22 1400  8    so vital for growth. Corporations should pay added
G22 1410  5    taxes, to be used for educational purposes (not necessarily
G22 1420  3    of the formal type). The right to leave legacies should
G22 1430  2    be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated.
G22 1430  8    To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of
G22 1440  8    individuals who played no role in its creation prevents
G22 1450  6    those with real initiative from coming to the fore,
G22 1460  3    and is basically anti-democratic. When the proprietor
G22 1460 11    dies, the establishment should become a corporation
G22 1470  7    until it is either acquired by another proprietor or
G22 1480  5    the government decides to drop it. Strikes should be
G22 1490  3    declared illegal against corporations because disagreements
G22 1500  1    would have to be settled by government representatives
G22 1500  9    acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility
G22 1510  7    to the state would now be defined against proprietorship
G22 1520  6    because employees and proprietors must be completely
G22 1530  4    interdependent, as they are each a part of the whole.
G22 1540  2    Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship,
G22 1540  9    if internally motivated, prevent a healthy relationship.
G22 1550  6    Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily
G22 1560  6    out of mere power available to do so. If we cannot
G22 1580  6    stop warfare in our own economic system, how can we
G22 1590  2    expect to abolish it internationally?
G22 1590  7    #ONE KIND OF PROPRIETORSHIP#
G22 1600  1    These proposals would go far toward creating the economic
G22 1610  1    atmosphere favoring growth of the individual, who,
G22 1610  8    in turn, would help us to cope with runaway technology.
G22 1620  7    Individual human strength is needed to pit against
G22 1630  5    an inhuman condition. The battle is not easy. We are
G22 1640  3    tempted to blame others for our problems rather than
G22 1640 12    look them straight in the face and realize they are
G22 1650  9    of our own making and possible of solution only by
G22 1660  5    ourselves with the help of desperately needed, enlightened,
G22 1670  2    competent leaders. Persons developed in to-day's corporations
G22 1680  1    cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences
G22 1690  1    of my own in business and in activities outside. In
G22 1690 11    my own company, in effect a partnership, although legally
G22 1700  6    a corporation, I have been able to do many things for
G22 1710  6    my employees which "normal" corporations of comparable
G22 1720  3    size and nature would have been unable to do. Also,
G22 1720 13    I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship
G22 1730 11    instead of a partnership, I would have been even abler
G22 1740  9    to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees.
G22 1750  7    Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present
G22 1760  5    shape from experience in sharing in the growth and
G22 1770  3    control of my business, coupled with raising my family.
G22 1770 12    This combined experience, on a foundation of very average,
G22 1780  9    I assure you, intelligence and background, has helped
G22 1790  6    me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily
G22 1800  5    against. Perhaps a list of some of the "practices"
G22 1810  1    of my company will help here.
G22 1810  7       The company grew out of efforts by two completely
G22 1820  7    inexperienced men in their late twenties, neither having
G22 1830  3    a formal education applicable to, or experience in,
G22 1840  1    manufacturing or selling our type of articles. From
G22 1840  9    an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943, it has grown,
G22 1850  8    with no additional capital investment, to a present
G22 1860  4    value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 (we
G22 1870  2    don't disclose financial figures to the public). Its
G22 1870 10    growth continues steadily on a par with past growth;
G22 1880  9    and no limitation is in evidence. Our pin-curl clips
G22 1890  7    and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a
G22 1900  4    few years time, despite substantial, well established
G22 1900 11    competition.
