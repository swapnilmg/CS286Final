G49 0010  1       In one of the very few letters in which he ever
G49 0010 12    complained of Meynell, Thompson told Patmore of his
G49 0020  7    distress at having had to leave London before this
G49 0030  4    new friendship had developed further: "
G49 0040  1       That was a very absurd and annoying situation in
G49 0040 10    which I was placed by W. M.'s curious methods of handling
G49 0050  7    me. He never let me know that my visit was about to
G49 0060  7    terminate until the actual morning I was to leave for
G49 0070  4    Lymington. The result was that I found myself in the
G49 0080  1    ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement
G49 0080  9    by letter for the next week, only two days before my
G49 0090  9    departure from London. Luckily both women knew my position
G49 0100  6    and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not
G49 0110  4    I". It need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not
G49 0120  1    generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping
G49 0120  8    his social engagements, which makes his irritation
G49 0130  5    in this letter all the more significant.
G49 0140  1       When Thompson and her daughter began a correspondence
G49 0140  9    which included fervent verses from Pantasaph, Mrs.
G49 0150  7    King felt a proper Victorian alarm. Some, she knew,
G49 0160  6    looked upon Thompson almost as a saint, but others
G49 0180  3    read in "The Hound of Heaven" what they took to be
G49 0190  2    the confessions of a great sinner, who, like Oscar
G49 0190 11    Wilde, had- as one pious writer later put it- thrown
G49 0200 11    himself "on the swelling wave of every passion".
G49 0210  5       Consequently, on October 31, 1896, Mrs. King wrote
G49 0220  4    to Thompson, quite against her daughter's wishes, asking
G49 0230  2    him not to "recommence a correspondence which I believe
G49 0240  1    has been dropped for some weeks". Katherine was staying
G49 0240 10    at a convent, and her mother felt that, as Thompson
G49 0250  8    himself seems to have suggested, she might eventually
G49 0260  4    stay there. This prospect did not please Mrs. King
G49 0270  2    any more than did the possibility that her daughter
G49 0270 11    might marry a Bohemian, but she used it to suggest
G49 0280 10    to Thompson that, "It is not in her nature to love
G49 0300  8    you".
G49 0300  9       For his part, Thompson had explained in a previous
G49 0310  6    letter that there would be nothing but an honorable
G49 0320  2    friendship between Katie and himself. At no time does
G49 0320 11    he seem to have proposed marriage, and Mrs. King was
G49 0330 10    evidently torn between a concern for her daughter's
G49 0340  6    emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship
G49 0350  4    might be continued without harm to her reputation.
G49 0360  1    In any case, she told Thompson that she saw no reason
G49 0360 12    why he might not see Katie again, "now that this frank
G49 0370  9    explanation has been made + no one can misunderstand".
G49 0380  6    She ended her letter with the assurance that she considered
G49 0390  4    his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an
G49 0400  4    honor, from which she could not part "without still
G49 0400 13    more pain".
G49 0410  1       After Thompson came to London to live, he received
G49 0410 10    a letter from Katie, which was dated February 8, 1897.
G49 0420 10    She regretted what she described as the "unwarrantable
G49 0430  7    + unnecessary" check to their friendship and said that
G49 0440  5    she felt that they understood one another perfectly.
G49 0450  2    This letter concluded with an invitation: "
G49 0450  8       I am a great deal at the little children's Hospital.
G49 0460 10    Mr. Meynell knows the way. I know you are very busy
G49 0470 10    now, you are writing a great deal + your book is coming
G49 0480  7    out, isn't it? but if you are able + care to come,
G49 0490  3    you know how glad I shall be.
G49 0490 10       Ever yours sincerely,
G49 0500  1       Katherine Douglas King" The invitation was accepted
G49 0500  8    and other letters followed, in which she spoke of her
G49 0510 10    concern for his health and her delight in seeing him
G49 0520  7    so much at home among the crippled children she served.
G49 0530  4    It is difficult to say what Thompson expected would
G49 0540  2    come of their relationship, which had begun so soon
G49 0540 11    after his emotions had been stirred by Maggie Brien,
G49 0550  7    but when Katie wrote on April 11, 1900, to tell him
G49 0560  6    that she was to be married to the Rev. Godfrey Burr,
G49 0570  2    the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire, the news evidently
G49 0580  1    helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure
G49 0580  9    of his hopes for a new volume of verse. In a letter
G49 0590 10    to Meynell, which was written in June, less than a
G49 0600  6    month before Katie's wedding, he was highly melodramatic
G49 0610  2    in his despair and once again announced his intention
G49 0610 11    of returning to the life of the streets: "
G49 0620  8       A week in arrears, and without means to pay, I must
G49 0630  8    go, it is the only right thing. ... Perhaps Mrs. Meynell
G49 0640  4    would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own
G49 0650  3    copy of the first edition of my first book, with all
G49 0650 14    its mementos of her and the dear ones. ... Last, not
G49 0660 10    least, there are some poems which K. King sent me (addressed
G49 0670  7    to herself) when I was preparing a fresh volume, asking
G49 0680  5    me to include them. The terrible blow of the New Year
G49 0690  4    put an end to that project. I wish you would return
G49 0690 15    them to her. I have not the heart. ... I never had
G49 0700 12    the courage to look at them, when my projected volume
G49 0710  7    became hopeless, fearing they were poor, until now
G49 0720  4    when I was obliged to do so. ... O my genius, young
G49 0730  1    and ripening, you would swear,- when I wrote them;
G49 0730 10    and now! What has it all come to? All chance of fulfilling
G49 0740 11    my destiny is over. ... I want you to be grandfather
G49 0750  9    to these orphaned poems, dear father-brother, now I
G49 0760  5    am gone; and launch them on the world when their time
G49 0770  2    comes. For them a box will be lodgment enough. ...
G49 0770 12    Katie cannot mind your seeing them now; since my silence
G49 0780  9    must have ended when I gave the purposed volume to
G49 0790  7    you. ... I ask you to do me the last favour of reading
G49 0800  4    them by 8 to-morrow evening, about which time I shall
G49 0810  1    come to say my sad good-bye. If you don't think much
G49 0810 13    of them, tell me the wholesome truth. If otherwise,
G49 0820  7    you will give me a pleasure. O Wilfrid! it is strange;
G49 0830  6    but this- yes, terrible step I am about to take ...
G49 0840  6    is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found
G49 0850  1    hope that here, in these poems, is treasure- or at
G49 0850 11    least some measure of beauty, which I did not know
G49 0860  9    of". ... Thompson, of course, was persuaded not to
G49 0880  5    take the "terrible step"; Meynell once again paid his
G49 0890  4    debts and it was Katie, rather than Thompson, whose
G49 0900  1    life was soon ended, for she died in childbirth in
G49 0900 11    April, 1901, in the first year of her marriage.
G49 0910  7       The "orphaned poems" mentioned in the letter to
G49 0920  5    Meynell comprised a group of five sonnets, which were
G49 0930  2    published in the 1913 edition of Thompson's works under
G49 0930 11    the heading "Ad Amicam", plus certain other completed
G49 0940  8    pieces and rough drafts gathered together in one of
G49 0950  7    the familiar exercise books. The publication of Father
G49 0960  4    Connolly's The Man Has Wings has made more of the group
G49 0970  5    available in print so that a general picture of what
G49 0980  2    it contained can now be had without difficulty. Some
G49 0980 11    of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered
G49 0990 10    love; others suggest its coming loss or describe the
G49 1000  6    poet's feelings when he learns of a final separation.
G49 1010  2       The somewhat Petrarchan love story which these poems
G49 1020  2    suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they
G49 1020 10    have more than a little of autobiographical sincerity.
G49 1030  7    When they were first written, there was evidently no
G49 1040  6    thought of their being published, and those which refer
G49 1050  4    to the writer's love for Mrs. Meynell particularly
G49 1060  1    have the ring of truth. In "My Song's Young Virgin
G49 1060 11    Date", for example, Thompson wrote: "Yea, she that
G49 1070  8    had my song's young virgin date Not now, alas, that
G49 1080  8    noble singular she, I nobler hold, though marred from
G49 1090  5    her once state, Than others in their best integrity.
G49 1100  1    My own stern hand has rent the ancient bond, And thereof
G49 1100 12    shall the ending not have end: But not for me, that
G49 1110 11    loved her, to be fond Lightly to please me with a newer
G49 1120  9    friend. Then hold it more than bravest-feathered song,
G49 1130  4    That I affirm to thee, with heart of pride, I knew
G49 1140  3    not what did to a friend belong Till I stood up, true
G49 1140 15    friend, by thy true side; Whose absence dearer comfort
G49 1150  9    is, by far, Than presences of other women are"!
G49 1160  6       Taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization
G49 1170  5    and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life
G49 1180  6    with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy
G49 1190  2    loves, there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion
G49 1190 12    for Katie King. That she was affected by his protestations
G49 1200 10    seems obvious, but since she was evidently a sensible
G49 1210  8    young woman- as well as an outgoing and sympathetic
G49 1220  5    type- it would seem that for her the word friendship
G49 1230  2    had a far less intense emotional significance than
G49 1230 10    that which Thompson gave it. From the outset, she must
G49 1240 10    have realized that marriage with him was out of the
G49 1250  8    question, and although she was displeased by the "unwarrantable"
G49 1260  4    interference, it seems probable that she did agree
G49 1270  4    with her mother's suggestion that the poet was "perhaps"
G49 1280  1    a man "most fitted to live + die solitary, + in the
G49 1280 13    love only of the Highest Lover".
G49 1290  6       The poems which were addressed to her, while they
G49 1300  5    are far more restrained than those of "Love in Dian's
G49 1310  2    Lap", show no great technical advance over those of
G49 1310 11    the "Narrow Vessel" group and are, if anything, somewhat
G49 1320  8    more labored. Their interest remains chiefly biographical,
G49 1330  6    for they throw some light on the utter despair which
G49 1340  6    overtook Thompson in the spring and early summer of
G49 1350  3    1900.
G49 1350  4       Whether or not Danchin is correct in suggesting
G49 1360  1    that Thompson's resumption of the opium habit also
G49 1360  9    dates from this period is, of course, a matter of conjecture.
G49 1370 10    Reid simply states, without offering any supporting
G49 1380  5    evidence, that "after he returned to London, he resumed
G49 1390  5    his draughts of laudanum, and continued this right
G49 1400  2    up to his death". There is every reason to recognize
G49 1400 12    that in the very last years of his life, as we shall
G49 1410 11    see, Thompson did take the drug in carefully rationed
G49 1420  6    doses to ease the pains of his illness, but the exact
G49 1430  4    date at which this began has never been determined.
G49 1430 13    If, as Reid says, "nearly all his poetry was produced
G49 1440 10    when he was not taking opium", there may be some reason
G49 1450  8    to doubt that he was under its influence in the period
G49 1460  6    from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to
G49 1470  3    Katie King and making plans for another book of verse.
G49 1470 13    In any event, the critical productivity of that time
G49 1480  9    is abundant proof that if he was taking laudanum, it
G49 1490  7    was never in command of him to the extent that it had
G49 1500  4    been during his vagrant years.
G49 1500  9       Meynell's remedy for Thompson's despondent mood
G49 1510  5    was typically practical. He simply found more work
G49 1520  4    for him to do, and the articles and reviews continued
G49 1530  1    without an evident break.
G49 1530  5    #@ III @#
G49 1530  8    As a reviewer, Thompson generally displayed a judicious
G49 1540  5    attitude. That he read some of the books assigned to
G49 1550  6    him with a studied carefulness is evident from his
G49 1560  2    notes, which are often so full that they provide an
G49 1560 12    unquestionable basis for the identification of reviews
G49 1570  7    that were printed without his signature. On the basis
G49 1580  6    of this careful reading, Thompson frequently gave a
G49 1590  3    clear, complete, and interesting description of a prose
G49 1590 11    work or chose effective quotations to illustrate his
G49 1600  8    discussions of poetry.
G49 1610  1       He was seldom an unmethodical critic, and his reviews
G49 1610 10    generally followed a systematic pattern: a description
G49 1620  7    of what the work contained, a treatment of the things
G49 1630  7    that had especially interested him in it, and, wherever
G49 1640  5    possible, a balancing of whatever artistic merits and
G49 1650  2    faults he might have found.
G49 1650  7       It was, of course, in this drawing of the balance
G49 1660  4    sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his
G49 1660 13    desire to do full justice to an author. Reviewing Davidson's
G49 1670 10    The Testament of an Empire Builder, for example, Thompson
G49 1680  9    found that there was "too much metrical dialectic".
G49 1700  7    Poetry, he said, must be "dogmatic": it must not stoop
G49 1710  6    to argue like a "K.C. in cloth-of-gold". Yet Davidson
G49 1720  6    impressed him as a poet capable of "sustained power,
G49 1730  2    passion, or beauty", and he cited specific passages
G49 1740  1    to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's
G49 1740  9    command of imagery as well. Similarly, he wrote that
G49 1750  8    Laurence Housman had a "too deliberate manner" as well
G49 1760  5    as a lack of "inevitable felicity in diction". But
G49 1770  4    he admired Housman's "subtle intellectuality" and delighted
G49 1780  3    in the inversion by which Divine Love becomes the most
G49 1790  1    "fatal" allurement in "Love the Tempter".
G49 1790  7       Of course, there were books about which nothing
G49 1800  7    good could be said. Understanding, as he did, the difficulty
G49 1810  6    of the art of poetry, and believing that the "only
G49 1820  4    technical criticism worth having in poetry is that
G49 1820 12    of poets", he felt obliged to insist upon his duty
G49 1830 10    to be hard to please when it came to the review of
G49 1840  8    a book of verse.
