G34 0010  1    With each song he gave verbal footnotes. The songs
G34 0010 10    Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of
G34 0020  6    a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments.
G34 0030  4    Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons
G34 0040  1    who had similar ballads or ditties. In due time Sandburg
G34 0040 11    was a walking thesaurus of American folk music.
G34 0050  8       After he had finished the first two volumes of his
G34 0060  7    Lincoln, Sandburg went to work assembling a book of
G34 0070  5    songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory
G34 0080  2    of songs others had taught him. He rummaged, found
G34 0080 11    composers and arrangers, collaborated on the main design
G34 0090  8    and outline of harmonization with musicians, ballad
G34 0100  4    singers, and musicologists.
G34 0100  7       The result was a collection of 280 songs, ballads,
G34 0110  9    ditties, brought together from all regions of America,
G34 0120  6    more than one hundred never before published: The American
G34 0130  3    Songbag. Each song or ditty was prefaced by an author's
G34 0140  4    note which indicated the origin and meaning of the
G34 0150  1    song as well as special interest the song had, musical
G34 0150 11    arrangement, and most of the chorus and verses.
G34 0160  8       The book, published in 1927, has been selling steadily
G34 0170  5    ever since. As Sandburg said at the time: "It is as
G34 0180  4    ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to
G34 0190  1    the Appalachian Mountains, it is as modern as skyscrapers,
G34 0190 10    the Volstead Act, and the latest oil well gusher".
G34 0200  8    #SCHOPENHAUER NEVER LEARNED#
G34 0210  1    Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer. Two
G34 0210 10    things contribute to his popularity. First, Carl respects
G34 0220  8    his audience and prepares his speeches carefully. Even
G34 0230  6    when he is called upon for impromptu remarks, he has
G34 0240  4    notes written on the back of handy envelopes. He has
G34 0250  3    his own system of shorthand, devised by abbreviations:
G34 0250 11    "humility" will be "humly", "with" will be "w", and
G34 0260  9    "that" will be "tt".
G34 0270  4       The second reason for his popularity is his complete
G34 0280  4    spontaneity with the guitar. It is a mistake, however,
G34 0290  1    to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop.
G34 0290 11    He is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a
G34 0300  6    dedicated, humble, and bashful apostle of this instrument.
G34 0310  5    At age seventy-four, he became what he shyly terms
G34 0320  3    a "pupil" of Andres Segovia, the great guitarist of
G34 0330  1    the Western world.
G34 0330  4       It is not easy to become Segovia's pupil. One needs
G34 0340  3    high talent. Segovia has written about Carl:
G34 0350  1       "His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he
G34 0350  9    asked for my help in disciplining them. I found that
G34 0360  7    this precocious, grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be
G34 0370  5    taught. There has long existed a brotherly affection
G34 0380  1    between us, thus I accepted him as my pupil. Just as
G34 0380 12    in the case of every prodigy child, we must watch for
G34 0390  8    the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future-
G34 0400  6    if he should master all the strenuous exercises I inflicted
G34 0410  3    on him.
G34 0410  5       To play the guitar as he aspires will devour his
G34 0420  3    three-fold energy as a historian, a poet and a singer.
G34 0420 14    One cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact
G34 0430  8    that he failed to learn the guitar. I am certain that
G34 0440  8    Carl Sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy.
G34 0450  5    The heart of this great poet constantly bubbles forth
G34 0460  2    a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar".
G34 0470  1       The public's identification of Carl Sandburg and
G34 0470  8    the guitar is no happenstance. Nor does Carl reject
G34 0480  8    this identity.
G34 0480 10       He is proud of having Segovia for a friend and dedicated
G34 0490 11    a poem to him titled "The Guitar".
G34 0500  4       Carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to
G34 0510  4    the guitar because he has never heard of any other
G34 0510 14    poem to that subtle instrument. "A portable companion
G34 0520  8    always ready to go where you go- a small friend weighing
G34 0530  9    less than a freshborn infant- to be shared with few
G34 0540  8    or many- just two of you in sweet meditation".
G34 0550  1       The New York Herald Tribune's photographer, Ira
G34 0560  2    Rosenberg, tells an anecdote about the time he wanted
G34 0560 11    to take a picture of Carl playing a guitar. Carl hadn't
G34 0570  9    brought his along. Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they
G34 0580  5    go out and find one.
G34 0580 10       "Preferably", said Carl, "one battered and worn,
G34 0590  7    such as might be found in a pawnshop".
G34 0600  4       They went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller of 1162
G34 0610  3    Sixth Avenue.
G34 0610  5       "Mr. Miller was in the shop", the Herald Tribune
G34 0620  4    story related, "but was reluctant to have anybody's
G34 0630  2    picture taken inside, because his business was too
G34 0630 10    'confidential' for pictures.
G34 0640  3       "But after introductions he asked: 'Carl Sandburg?
G34 0650  3    Well you can pose inside'.
G34 0660  1       "He wanted Mr. Sandburg to pose with one of the
G34 0660 11    guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center
G34 0670  7    of his shop, but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully.
G34 0680  3    'Kalamazoo guitars', he said, 'used by radio hillbilly
G34 0690  4    singers'.
G34 0690  5       "He chose one from Mr. Miller's window, a plain
G34 0700  4    guitar with no fancy polish. While the picture was
G34 0710  2    taken, Mr. Miller's disposition to be generous to Mr.
G34 0720  1    Sandburg increased to the point where he advised, 'I
G34 0720 10    won't even charge you the one dollar rental fee'".
G34 0730  8    #A KNOWLEDGEABLE CELEBRITY#
G34 0740  1    When someone in the audience rose and asked how does
G34 0740 11    it feel to be a celebrity, Carl said, "A celebrity
G34 0750  8    is a fellow who eats celery with celerity".
G34 0760  3       This has always been Carl's attitude. Lloyd Lewis
G34 0770  3    wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916, Sandburg
G34 0770 13    was making $27.50 a week writing features for the Day
G34 0780 10    Book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants.
G34 0790  7    He walked home at night for two miles beyond the end
G34 0800  7    of a suburban trolley.
G34 0800 11       When fame came it changed Sandburg only slightly.
G34 0810  7    Lewis remembered another newspaperman asking, "Carl,
G34 0820  3    have your ideas changed any since you got all these
G34 0830  3    comforts"?
G34 0830  4       Carl thought the question over slowly and answered:
G34 0840  3    "I know a starving man who is fed never remembers all
G34 0850  2    the pangs of his starvation, I know that".
G34 0850 10       That was all he said, Lewis reports. That was all
G34 0860  8    he had to say.
G34 0860 12       In answer to a New York Times query on what is fame
G34 0870 11    ("Thoughts on Fame", October 23, 1960), Carl said:
G34 0880  7    "Fame is a figment of a pigment. It comes and goes.
G34 0890  6    It changes with every generation. There never were
G34 0900  3    two fames alike. One fame is precious and luminous;
G34 0900 12    another is a bubble of a bauble".
G34 0910  7    #"AH, DID YOU ONCE SEE SHELLEY PLAIN"?#
G34 0920  2    The impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is
G34 0930  1    one of laughter and happiness; and the laughter and
G34 0930 10    the happiness are even more pronounced when no company
G34 0940  7    is present.
G34 0940  9       Carl has been married to Paula for fifty-three years,
G34 0950  8    and he has not made a single major decision without
G34 0960  4    careful consideration and thorough discussion with
G34 0970  2    his wife. Through all these years, Mrs. Sandburg has
G34 0970 11    pointedly avoided the limelight. She has shared her
G34 0980  8    husband's greatness, but only within the confines of
G34 0990  7    their home; it is a dedication which began the moment
G34 1000  4    she met Carl.
G34 1000  7       Mrs. Sandburg received a Phi Beta Kappa key from
G34 1010  6    the University of Chicago and she was busy writing
G34 1020  2    and teaching when she met Sandburg. "You are the 'Peoples'
G34 1030  1    Poet'" was her appraisal in 1908, and she stopped teaching
G34 1040  1    and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of
G34 1040 10    her husband's career.
G34 1050  2       She has rarely been photographed with him and, except
G34 1060  1    for Carl's seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in
G34 1060  8    Chicago in 1953, she has not attended the dozens of
G34 1070  8    banquets, functions, public appearances, and dinners
G34 1080  3    honoring him- all of this upon her insistence. Even
G34 1090  2    now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few
G34 1090 14    bare facts.
G34 1100  1       The only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say
G34 1100 11    she is beautiful in a Grecian sense. Her clothes, her
G34 1110  9    hair, everything about her is both graceful and simple.
G34 1120  7    She has small, broad, capable hands and an enormous
G34 1130  4    energy.
G34 1130  5       She is not only a trained mathematician and Classicist,
G34 1140  3    but a good architect. She designed and supervised the
G34 1150  2    building of the Harbert, Michigan, house, most of which
G34 1150 11    was constructed by one local carpenter who carried
G34 1160  7    the heavy beams singly upon his shoulder. As the Sandburg
G34 1170  6    goat herd increased, she also designed the barn alterations
G34 1180  4    to accommodate them. When erosion threatened the foundation
G34 1190  3    of their home in Harbert, Paula Sandburg planted grapevines
G34 1200  1    and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the
G34 1200 10    sands away.
G34 1210  1       She was born Lilian Steichen, her parents immigrants
G34 1210  9    from Luxemburg. Her mother called her Paus'l, a Luxemburg
G34 1220  9    endearment meaning "pussycat". Some of the children
G34 1230  7    of the family could not pronounce this name and called
G34 1240  6    her Paula, a soubriquet Carl liked so much she has
G34 1250  4    been Paula ever since.
G34 1250  8       But neither was Lilian her baptismal name. Her parents,
G34 1260  6    pious Roman Catholics, christened her Mary Anne Elizabeth
G34 1270  5    Magdalene Steichen. "My mother read a book right after
G34 1280  4    I was born and there was a Lilian in the book she loved
G34 1290  2    and I became Lilian- and eventually I became Paula".
G34 1300  1       Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student. This
G34 1300  8    family of Luxemburg immigrants, in fact, produced two
G34 1310  6    exceptional children. Paula's older brother is Edward
G34 1320  5    Steichen, a talented artist and, for the past half-century,
G34 1330  4    one of the world's eminent photographers. (Two years
G34 1340  2    ago the photography editor of Vogue magazine titled
G34 1340 10    his article about Steichen, "The World's Greatest Photographer".)
G34 1360  1       By the time Lilian had been graduated from public
G34 1360 10    school, her parents were doing quite well. Her mother
G34 1370  8    was a good manager and established a millinery business
G34 1380  4    in Milwaukee. But her father was not enthusiastic about
G34 1390  2    sending young Paula to high school. "This is no place
G34 1400  2    for a young girl", he said. The parents compromised,
G34 1400 11    however, on a convent school and Paula went to Ursuline
G34 1410 10    Academy in London, Ontario.
G34 1420  2       She was pious, too, once kneeling through the night
G34 1430  1    from Holy Thursday to Good Friday, despite the protest
G34 1430 10    of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl.
G34 1440 10    She knelt out of reverence for having read the Meditations
G34 1450  6    of St. Augustine.
G34 1450  9       She read everything else she could get her hands
G34 1460  9    on, including an article (she thinks it was in the
G34 1470  7    Atlantic Monthly) by Mark Twain on "White Slavery".
G34 1480  3    Paula was saddened about what was happening to little
G34 1490  2    girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel. She had
G34 1490 13    come to a decision. If there was ever a thought in
G34 1500 10    her mind she might devote her life to religion, it
G34 1510  6    was now dispelled. "I felt that I must devote myself
G34 1520  2    to the 'outside' world".
G34 1520  6       She passed the entrance examinations to the University
G34 1530  5    of Illinois, but during the year at Urbana felt more
G34 1540  5    important events transpired at the University of Chicago.
G34 1550  3       "And besides, Thorstein Veblen was one of the Chicago
G34 1560  2    professors".
G34 1560  3       At the University of Chicago she studied Whitman
G34 1570  2    and Shelley, and became a Socialist. Socialist leaders
G34 1580  1    in Milwaukee recognized her worth, not only because
G34 1580  9    of her dedication but because of her fluency in German,
G34 1590  8    French, and Luxemburg. She once gave a German recitation
G34 1600  6    before a convention of German-language teachers in
G34 1610  3    Milwaukee.
G34 1610  4       Carl and Paula met in Milwaukee in 1907 during Paula's
G34 1620  5    Christmas holiday visit to her parents. Carl was still
G34 1630  3    Charles A. Sandburg. He "legitimized" Paula for Lilian
G34 1640  2    Steichen, and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for
G34 1640 12    Charles.
G34 1650  1       Victor Berger, the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism
G34 1650  8    and member of Congress, had asked Paula Steichen to
G34 1660  9    translate some of his German editorials into English.
G34 1670  6    Carl, who was stationed in Appleton, Wisconsin, organizing
G34 1680  3    for the Social Democrats, was in Berger's office and
G34 1690  3    made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar.
G34 1700  1    She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton,
G34 1700 12    Illinois. (After graduation from the University of
G34 1710  7    Chicago, Paula taught for two years in the normal school
G34 1720  8    at Valley City, North Dakota, then two years at Princeton
G34 1730  6    (Illinois) Township High School.) By the time the streetcar
G34 1740  5    pulled away, he had fallen in love with Paula.
G34 1750  1       A letter awaited her at Princeton. Paula says that
G34 1750 10    even though Carl's letters usually began, "Dear Miss
G34 1760  8    Steichen", there was an understanding from the beginning
G34 1770  7    that they would become husband and wife.
G34 1780  3       Paula generously lent me one of Carl's love letters,
G34 1790  2    dated February 21, 1908, Hotel Athearn, Oshkosh, Wisconsin:
G34 1800  1       "Dear Miss Steichen: It is a very good letter you
G34 1810  1    send me- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare
G34 1810 10    I am carrying on up here. Never until in this work
G34 1820  9    of S-D organization have I realized and felt the
G34 1830  7    attitude and experience of a Teacher.
