P25 0010  1       Richard's next interest seemed the product of his
P25 0010  9    insularity. His broad reading took him into certain
P25 0020  8    by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began
P25 0030  5    to fascinate him. When he was twelve he took to reading
P25 0040  3    St. Augustine and Aquinas, then Lao-tse, Confucius,
P25 0050  1    Mencius, Suzuki, Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists
P25 0050  8    and numerous socio-archaeological papers. For his birthday,
P25 0060  7    because Richard had seen them in a store and asked
P25 0070  8    for them, his mother bought him the Zend-Avesta and
P25 0080  2    a little image of the Indian god, Acala. And one day,
P25 0090  2    on her own, his mother came home with a present entitled
P25 0090 13    The Book of the Dead, which she suspected Richard would
P25 0100 10    enjoy. He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled,
P25 0110  8    then went to his room to read.
P25 0120  2       At dinner one night, when he was fourteen, Richard
P25 0120 11    announced, "There is only one god".
P25 0130  6       "Did you think there were two"? grinned his father.
P25 0140  5       "You don't understand", Richard said gloomily.
P25 0150  4       Through quiet laughter his mother said, "Don't speak
P25 0160  3    to your father like that, Richard".
P25 0160  9       Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak
P25 0170  8    to his parents about religion again.
P25 0180  3       His interest in the formal study of religion waned
P25 0190  1    when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest
P25 0190 12    in Asian affairs. Although he still didn't speak to
P25 0200  8    anyone, he grew fond of saying, "The future lies in
P25 0210  7    Asia", when the opportunity arose, and when he graduated
P25 0220  5    from high school his parents sent him to New York to
P25 0230  3    give him a foundation, they said, for his life in Asian
P25 0230 14    studies.
P25 0240  1       Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired,
P25 0250  1    in his remoteness, a thorough if bookish knowledge
P25 0250  9    of Asian lore, literature, life, politics and history.
P25 0260  6    He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies
P25 0270  4    in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes, the biwa upon
P25 0280  2    which he had been practicing and his image of Acala,
P25 0280 12    and left to spend a week at home before leaving the
P25 0290 10    country.
P25 0290 11       The week at home was not comfortable. His mother,
P25 0300  7    who had seen little of him for four years, appeared
P25 0310  4    worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient
P25 0320  2    which, she herself having slight knowledge of it, had
P25 0320 11    to be distrusted. She seemed to work to grow close
P25 0330  8    to her son in the few days he spent at home, talking
P25 0340  6    to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his
P25 0350  3    childhood and then trying to talk to him about those
P25 0350 13    things in which he alone was interested.
P25 0360  7       "Do you still have The Book of the Dead"? she asked
P25 0370  7    him and, laughing, she added, "I was nervous about
P25 0380  4    buying a book with a title like that, but I knew you'd
P25 0390  2    like it".
P25 0390  4       "Yes", he lied to shorten the conversation, "I still
P25 0400  3    have it". He was no longer able to relax in the presence
P25 0410  2    of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a
P25 0410 13    conversation with his mother or father, no matter the
P25 0420  9    subject. As for The Book of the Dead, it along with
P25 0430  8    his other books on religion had been incarcerated in
P25 0440  3    a furnace in the basement of the building in which
P25 0450  1    he had lived in New York. He had dusted each of the
P25 0450 13    books carefully and carried them all to the basement
P25 0460  8    and, trembling at having to open the big furnace, given
P25 0470  5    them up to the flames. Then he sped from the dark basement
P25 0480  3    and returned to his room and cried.
P25 0480 10       Richard left America with his clothes, his biwa
P25 0490  7    and his image of Acala and, on the freighter which
P25 0500  3    took him to Japan, he plucked at the biwa, trying to
P25 0510  2    make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese
P25 0510 11    tune he had once heard. During his second week at sea
P25 0520  9    he brought the curious melody out of the instrument
P25 0530  5    and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at
P25 0540  2    just that moment in its history when it had given him
P25 0540 13    pleasure. He stole from his cabin late that night and
P25 0550 10    crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped
P25 0560  6    the biwa into the water. It was so dark that he didn't
P25 0570  4    see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean
P25 0580  1    kept him from hearing it. It was as though the biwa
P25 0580 12    had been eaten up by the wind.
P25 0600  4       In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that
P25 0610  2    which he had lived in New York, except that he had
P25 0610 13    replaced his biwa with a friend. An American student
P25 0620  8    named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of
P25 0630  6    his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded
P25 0640  3    in getting him to talk to her. He had nothing much
P25 0640 14    to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please
P25 0650 12    her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually
P25 0660  7    searching tours of Tokyo. In Charlotte, Richard saw
P25 0670  3    a frankness and a zest for doing things which, after
P25 0680  2    a fashion, he envied. In time, he grew to depend upon
P25 0680 13    her occasional company and she at length was able to
P25 0690  9    encourage him to participate in more social activity.
P25 0700  5    She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some
P25 0710  3    of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms
P25 0720  1    and in the end he complied with her wishes, although
P25 0720 11    it was only rarely that he added anything to the random
P25 0730  8    conversations.
P25 0730  9       At one such gathering Charlotte announced, "I was
P25 0740  6    at Ryusenji today. Have you ever been to Ryusenji"?
P25 0750  6    No one had. "Well, it's at Fudomae and there was a
P25 0760  5    tan young man, quite naked, taking a shower in the
P25 0770  2    pool. I was thoroughly startled".
P25 0770  7       Richard thought it a more promising remark than
P25 0780  5    any made during the last conversation, but Charlotte's
P25 0790  2    manner during the gatherings was more flippant and
P25 0790 10    superficial than when she was alone with him and he
P25 0800 10    was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better
P25 0810  6    than the pointless words which had preceded it. Three
P25 0820  3    of the four persons present, all foreign students in
P25 0830  1    Tokyo, had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese
P25 0830 11    foods by the In and Out system, an equation in which
P25 0840 10    Zen philosophy was used as the modifier. Soba, udon
P25 0850  6    and tea were In because they could be taken noisily.
P25 0860  3    Sushi was Out because it was pretentious. Sashimi was
P25 0870  1    In, Samuel Burns had suggested, because it was too
P25 0870 10    far Out to stay Out, even if it was a little pretentious.
P25 0890  9    Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game,
P25 0900  5    the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his
P25 0910  3    ears.
P25 0910  4       "He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching
P25 0920  2    him", said Charlotte.
P25 0920  5       "Did you watch him"? asked a red-haired girl named
P25 0930  6    Ceecee Witter. "I shouldn't have been able to do that".
P25 0940  5       "Well I was able to do it", Charlotte said with
P25 0950  3    no sign of irritation. "For a minute, anyhow. I'm surprised
P25 0960  2    no one has been there. I've been there a number of
P25 0960 13    times. Sam, I thought you knew everything about Tokyo.
P25 0970  9    You've never been to Ryusenji"?
P25 0980  4       "I've heard about it", Samuel Burns said. "There's
P25 0990  4    a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated
P25 1000  2    to Gompachi and Komurasaki".
P25 1000  6       "Yes, a little parkish place", Charlotte said, and
P25 1010  5    concluded, "Anyhow, it's all very nice. And the man
P25 1020  6    who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there,
P25 1030  2    next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo. Oh, that's
P25 1030 12    what I meant to tell you. This is the interesting part,
P25 1040 11    Richard", she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull
P25 1050 10    him into the talking. "There was that fellow out there
P25 1060  6    in the bitter cold"-
P25 1060 10       "My God, it was cold today", said Samuel Burns.
P25 1070  9    "Twenty-two or twenty-three".
P25 1080  4       "And the water would be still colder", Ceecee seemed
P25 1090  3    to shiver at the thought of it.
P25 1090 10       "And your golden god", said Samuel Burns, "probably
P25 1100  6    went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath.
P25 1110  6    It would kill one of us".
P25 1120  1       "But the point is", Charlotte said, "there he was,
P25 1120  9    freezing, naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji,
P25 1130  9    all in worship of Fudo, the god of fire".
P25 1140  5       Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest
P25 1150  3    moment to reflect sharp light. It was true; Fudo, the
P25 1170  1    god of wisdom, was also thought of as the Japanese
P25 1170 11    version of Acala. The conversation went on but Richard
P25 1180  7    stopped listening. He found himself trying to remember
P25 1190  5    something, but he couldn't decide even the nature of
P25 1200  3    what it was he worked to recall. He had almost given
P25 1200 14    up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into
P25 1210 11    the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for
P25 1220  8    which he had been searching. Perhaps he sensed some
P25 1230  4    connection between the incident on the freighter and
P25 1240  2    the ascetic at Ryusenji, he was unable to put it together.
P25 1250  1       That night, after leaving Charlotte's apartment,
P25 1250  6    Richard walked about for a time before returning to
P25 1260  8    his room. When he at last did go to his room, he couldn't
P25 1270  6    sleep and instead paced up and down before his little
P25 1280  3    image of Acala, thinking first of Charlotte's tale
P25 1280 11    of the man at Ryusenji, then of his biwa and the invisible
P25 1290 12    Pacific waters. And the next morning, not sure of why
P25 1300  9    he went, he took the train to Fudomae and walked to
P25 1310  6    Ryusenji.
P25 1310  7       He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced
P25 1320  4    as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned.
P25 1330  3    He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the
P25 1340  1    water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped
P25 1340 11    from large spigots high at the back of the pool. On
P25 1350  9    the hillside above was caged what might have been an
P25 1360  4    incarnation of Fudo, or perhaps a demon. The strange
P25 1370  1    creature, housed in wire, made him shudder. The sensation
P25 1370 10    he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him
P25 1380  7    he had been there before but he knew he had not, and
P25 1390  8    could not recall any place he had visited to be likened
P25 1400  4    to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls
P25 1410  1    or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach.
P25 1410  9       He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs
P25 1420  7    to the temple, and the sense of familiarity with the
P25 1430  4    place would not leave him. Into a little well before
P25 1440  1    the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he
P25 1440 12    had an urge to sound the bell before the temple, to
P25 1450  9    take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle
P25 1460  5    of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call out would
P25 1470  3    not, he knew, come in the person of the temple priest.
P25 1470 14    Instead, he walked around the temple and mounted still
P25 1480  9    another flight of stairs and stood before the seated
P25 1490  7    Fudo at their head. The black Fudo seemed to stare
P25 1500  4    rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught
P25 1510  1    by the Fudo's in fascination, and then Richard was
P25 1510 10    shocked as, all at once, flames shot out from the sharp
P25 1520 10    features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic
P25 1530  7    scraping sound, as if the large statue were about to
P25 1540  4    burst from some pressure within it. Then the flames
P25 1550  1    were gone, the stillness fell upon the severe black
P25 1550 10    face and Richard began to tremble violently. Suddenly
P25 1560  6    he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped
P25 1570  4    them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried
P25 1580  1    back down both stairways and away from the temple,
P25 1580 10    never looking back. He walked all the miles back to
P25 1590  9    his room.
P25 1590 11       He seemed to have picked up a virus that day, because
P25 1600  9    the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit
P25 1610  6    hot. He stayed home, reading and refusing to think
P25 1620  2    about his frightening experience at Ryusenji. But the
P25 1620 10    process of refusing to think about it was an active
P25 1630 10    reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a
P25 1640  6    consciousness of it throughout the day. The cold lingered,
P25 1650  3    making sleep difficult that night, and he remained
P25 1660  1    in bed still the next morning, now unable to keep from
P25 1660 12    thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal,
P25 1670  7    the wretched sound, the unbearable feeling of having
P25 1680  4    been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time
P25 1690  2    in his life. All of the elements of the experience
P25 1690 12    were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy
P25 1700  9    upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple
P25 1710  6    at Fudomae.
