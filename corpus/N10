N10 0010  1       The Brannon outfit- known as the Slash-B because
N10 0010 10    of its brand- reached Hondo Creek before sundown. The
N10 0020  9    herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass
N10 0030  7    flat which was to be the first night's bedground. Two
N10 0040  3    of the new hands, a Mexican named Jose Amado and a
N10 0050  2    kid known only as Laredo, were picked for the first
N10 0050 12    trick of riding night herd.
N10 0060  3       The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and
N10 0070  1    turned them into the remuda. They got tin cups of coffee
N10 0070 12    from the big pot on the coosie's fire, rolled and lighted
N10 0080  9    brown-paper cigarettes, lounged about. There was some
N10 0090  6    idle talk, a listless discussion of this or that small
N10 0100  5    happening during the day's drive. But they deliberately
N10 0110  1    avoided the one subject that had them all curious:
N10 0110 10    the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the
N10 0120 10    outfit. It especially bothered the older hands.
N10 0130  4       The cook, Mateo Garcia, had arrived there long before
N10 0140  4    the herd. He'd started a fire and put coffee on, and
N10 0150  2    now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon.
N10 0150 13    He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the
N10 0160  8    Dutch oven. Supper would be ready within the hour.
N10 0170  5       The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp
N10 0180  2    nearby. Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom
N10 0180 11    Brannon's and his father's wagon. Hank had gathered
N10 0190  8    wood for a cookfire, and his wife was busy at it now.
N10 0200  9    Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena,
N10 0210  4    trying to keep them from falling into the creek by
N10 0220  2    which they persisted in playing. Conchita nagged at
N10 0220 10    the younger children, attempting without success to
N10 0230  5    keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon.
N10 0240  1       Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly
N10 0240 10    after the Maguires joined it, which had been at midday.
N10 0250 10    He'd come alone, without his wife and child. He'd been
N10 0260  8    in an angry mood: Conchita had thought his face almost
N10 0270  6    ugly with the anger in him.
N10 0270 12       She wondered what had taken place in town, between
N10 0280  9    him and his wife. She wished that she could talk to
N10 0290  7    her mother about it. Not that her mother knew what
N10 0300  3    had happened, but they could speculate upon it. But
N10 0300 12    her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it, and
N10 0310 10    say that it was none of her concern.
N10 0320  4       "Pat, get out of that creek! You too, Sean! Elena,
N10 0330  2    you'll get mud all over your dress"!
N10 0330  9       Even as she called to the children, Conchita let
N10 0340  9    her gaze seek Tom Brannon. Tomas, she called him- as
N10 0350  6    the Mexican hands did. He was in earnest conversation
N10 0360  2    with her father and the old vaquero, Luis Hernandez.
N10 0370  1    Whatever they are talking about? Conchita wondered.
N10 0370  8       It bothered her that she probably would never know.
N10 0380  9    Certainly, she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward.
N10 0390  6    He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs-
N10 0400  3    as though she were a little kid like Elena!
N10 0410  1       At the moment, the three men were not saying much
N10 0410 11    of anything. They were sitting on their heels, rider-fashion,
N10 0420  9    over by the still empty calf wagon. Brannon was hunkered
N10 0430  7    down with his broad back to the left rear wheel, with
N10 0440  6    the other two facing him. He held a cigarette in his
N10 0450  3    right hand. It was burning away, forgotten. His face
N10 0450 12    was clouded with unhappiness.
N10 0460  4       He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about
N10 0470  3    his wife's refusal to come with him and about what
N10 0480  1    he now intended to do. They were considering it gravely,
N10 0480 11    neither seeming to like what he planned.
N10 0490  6       Finally Hernandez said, "I could offer you advice,
N10 0500  4    Tomas, but you wouldn't heed it".
N10 0510  1       "Let's hear it, anyway".
N10 0510  4       "Wait a little while. Let Senora Brannon live in
N10 0520  4    her father's house for a time. Give her time to miss
N10 0530  3    you. Maybe she will then come to you. After all, you
N10 0530 14    want the senora as much as you want the boy. You need
N10 0540 11    her even more than you need him".
N10 0550  3       "She won't change her mind", Brannon said. "John
N10 0560  2    Clayton will see to that".
N10 0560  7       "But after a time away from you ...".
N10 0570  5       "A year, Luis? Five? Ten? How long should I wait"?
N10 0580  5    "Maybe in a year, Tomas ...".
N10 0590  1       "In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house
N10 0590  9    too much to come back to me", Brannon said flatly.
N10 0600  8    "And the boy will be too much under his influence by
N10 0610  6    then. I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before
N10 0620  3    I lose him altogether. Hell, in a year or five or ten,
N10 0630  1    the boy will have forgotten me- his own father"!
N10 0630 10       "But to take him and leave his mother behind is
N10 0640 10    not good".
N10 0640 12       "In my place, you'd follow such advice as you give
N10 0650 10    me"?
N10 0660  1       Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain. "That I can't
N10 0660  7    answer, for I can't imagine something like this happening
N10 0670  7    to me. Maybe I should withdraw my advice- no"?
N10 0680  5       Brannon looked at Hank Maguire. "And you? What would
N10 0690  5    you do in my place"?
N10 0690 10       Hank shook his head. "I don't know, Tom. Like Luis,
N10 0700 10    I can't see something like this happening to me. With
N10 0710  8    Maria and me, there's never any problem. Where I go,
N10 0720  6    she goes- and the kids with us. You're going to need
N10 0740  3    your woman. And the boy will need his mother. If you
N10 0740 14    take the one, you'd better take both".
N10 0750  7       Brannon shook his head. "I won't force Beth to come
N10 0760  7    against her will. But I'm going to have my son".
N10 0770  5       They were silent for a little while, each looking
N10 0780  2    glum.
N10 0780  3       Finally Luis Hernandez said, "What must be, must
N10 0790  2    be. I am with you, of course, Tomas".
N10 0790 10       And Hank Maguire added, "So am I, Tom".
N10 0800  6       "All right", Brannon said, rising. "We'll ride out
N10 0810  5    as soon as we've had chuck".
N10 0810 11    ##
N10 0820  1    Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after
N10 0820 12    nightfall. They had for cover both darkness and a summer
N10 0830  9    storm. During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had
N10 0840  6    watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to
N10 0850  3    the east. Later, they'd heard the rumble of thunder
N10 0850 12    and then, just outside Rockfork, they ran into rain.
N10 0860  8    Those who had slickers donned them. The others put
N10 0870  6    on old coats or ducking jackets, whichever they carried
N10 0880  3    behind their saddle cantles.
N10 0880  7       There were seven of them, enough for a show of strength-
N10 0890  9    to run a bluff. It was to be nothing more than that.
N10 0900  6    There was to be no gunplay. If the bluff failed and
N10 0910  3    they ran into trouble, Brannon had told the others,
N10 0910 12    they would withdraw- and he would come after his son
N10 0920 10    another time. He didn't want to put himself outside
N10 0930  6    the law.
N10 0930  8       With him were Hank Maguire, Luis Hernandez, and
N10 0940  5    Luis's son Pedro. The Ramirez brothers were also along.
N10 0950  5    The seventh man was Red Hogan, a wiry little puncher
N10 0960  2    with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising. They
N10 0960 13    were all good men.
N10 0970  4       It was dark early, because of the storm. Also because
N10 0980  2    of the storm, the streets of Rockfork were deserted.
N10 0980 11    Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour.
N10 0990  8    They reined in before the town marshal's office, a
N10 1000  7    box-sized building on Main Street. A lamp burned inside,
N10 1010  5    but Brannon, peering through the window, saw that the
N10 1020  4    office was empty. He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin
N10 1030  1    there.
N10 1030  2       "Probably just stepped out", he said. "Maybe to
N10 1040  1    have supper. Red, come along. The rest of you wait
N10 1040 11    here".
N10 1050  1       With Red Hogan, he rode to the Welcome Cafe. Hogan
N10 1050 10    got down from the saddle and had a look inside. "Not
N10 1060  9    there", he said, getting back onto his horse. "Maybe
N10 1070  5    he's at the hotel".
N10 1070  9       They rode to the Rockfork House, a little farther
N10 1080  8    along the opposite side of the street. They reined
N10 1090  5    in there, Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan
N10 1100  2    went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining
N10 1100 12    room. Brannon had no slicker. He'd put on his old brown
N10 1110 11    corduroy coat and it was already soaked. But he felt
N10 1120  8    no physical discomfort. He was only vaguely aware of
N10 1130  5    the sluicing rain. He hardly noticed the blue-green
N10 1140  1    flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder.
N10 1140 10       Hogan reappeared, stopped on the hotel porch, lifted
N10 1150  8    a hand in signal. Brannon dismounted and climbed the
N10 1160  5    steps.
N10 1160  6       "He's finished eating", Hogan said. "Sitting with
N10 1170  5    a cup of coffee now. It shouldn't be long".
N10 1180  3       It seemed long, at least to Tom Brannon. He and
N10 1190  2    Hogan waited by the door, one to either side. Macklin
N10 1190 12    was the third man to come out, and he came unhurriedly.
N10 1200 10    He was puffing on a cigar, and he was turning up his
N10 1210  7    coat collar against the rain. It was not until he moved
N10 1220  5    across the porch that he became aware of them, and
N10 1230  1    then it was too late. They closed in fast, kept him
N10 1230 12    from reaching inside his coat for his gun.
N10 1240  6       "Just come along", Brannon told him. "Don't start
N10 1250  4    anything you can't finish".
N10 1250  8       "Now, listen"- Macklin began.
N10 1260  3       "We'll talk over at your office".
N10 1270  1       "Brannon, I warn you"! "Let's go, Marsh al", Brannon
N10 1280  3    said, and took him by the arm.
N10 1280 10       Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm. They escorted
N10 1290  6    him down from the porch and through the rain to his
N10 1300  5    office. The other five Slash-B men followed them inside,
N10 1310  2    crowding the small room. His face was stiff with anger
N10 1310 12    when they let go of his arms. He looked at each of
N10 1320 12    them in turn, Brannon last of all.
N10 1330  4       "I'll remember you", he said. "Every last one of
N10 1340  4    you. As for you, Brannon"-
N10 1340  9       "Put your gun on the desk, Marshal".
N10 1350  4       "Now, hold on, damn it; I won't"-
N10 1360  3       Red Hogan's patience ran out. He lifted the skirt
N10 1370  1    of Macklin's coat, took his gun from its holster, tossed
N10 1370 11    it onto the desk. "Too much fooling around", he said.
N10 1380  8    "Don't press your luck, badge-toter".
N10 1390  4       Brannon said, "Now the key to the lockup, Marshal".
N10 1400  2       "Key"? Macklin said. "What for"?
N10 1410  1       "Can't you guess"? Brannon said. "We're putting
N10 1420  1    you where you won't come to harm. Come on- the key.
N10 1420 12    Get it out"!
N10 1430  2       "Damned if I will. Brannon, you've assaulted a law
N10 1440  2    officer and"-
N10 1440  4       They moved in on him, crowded him from all sides.
N10 1450  3    No man laid a hand on him, but the threat of violence
N10 1450 15    was there. His face took on a sudden pallor, became
N10 1460 10    beaded with sweat, and he seemed to have trouble with
N10 1470  7    his breathing. He held out a moment longer, then his
N10 1480  4    nerve gave under the pressure.
N10 1480  9       He swore, and said, "All right. It's here in my
N10 1490  8    pocket".
N10 1490  9       "Get it out", Brannon ordered. Then, as Macklin
N10 1500  6    obeyed: "Now let's go out back".
N10 1510  2       Resignedly, Macklin turned to the back door. They
N10 1520  1    followed him into the rain and across to the squat
N10 1520 11    stone building fifty feet to the rear. The door of
N10 1530  8    the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap
N10 1540  3    iron. It was secured by an oversized padlock. Macklin
N10 1550  1    balked again, not wanting to unlock and open the door.
N10 1550 11    They crowded him in that threatening way once more,
N10 1560  8    forced him to give in. Once the door was open, they
N10 1570  5    crowded him inside the dark building. He was uttering
N10 1580  1    threats in a low but savage voice when they closed
N10 1580 11    and padlocked the door.
N10 1590  3       They returned to the street, mounted their horses,
N10 1600  1    rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street.
N10 1600 12    Its windows glowed with lamplight. Deputy Marshal Luke
N10 1610  7    Harper still stood guard on the veranda, a forlorn,
N10 1620  7    scarecrowish figure in the murky dark. He came to the
N10 1630  5    edge of the veranda, peered down at them with his hand
N10 1640  1    on his gun.
N10 1640  4       "Don't try it", Brannon told him, dismounting and
N10 1650  2    starting up the steps with his men following. "Don't
N10 1650 11    get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern
N10 1660  8    you".
N10 1670  1       He strode past the now frightened man, entered the
N10 1670  9    house. Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda
N10 1680  7    to keep Harper from interfering. The others followed
N10 1690  4    Brannon inside. They trailed him across the wide hallway
N10 1700  4    to the parlor, four roughly garbed and tough-looking
N10 1710  1    men who probably had never before ventured into such
N10 1710 10    a house. They brought to it all the odors that clung
N10 1720  8    to men like themselves, that of their own sweat, of
N10 1730  4    campfire smoke, of horses and cattle. They tracked
N10 1740  1    mud on the oaken floor, on the carpet. Their presence
N10 1740 11    fouled the elegance of that room.
N10 1750  4       And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles
N10 1760  2    Ansley off guard.
