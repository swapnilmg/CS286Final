J15 0010  1    #INTRODUCTION#
J15 0010  2    Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though
J15 0020  1    serious complication of steroid therapy, with most
J15 0020  8    of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical
J15 0030  5    use. Although biopsies have shown structural changes
J15 0040  4    in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness,
J15 0050  2    this case provides the only example known to us in
J15 0050 12    which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive
J15 0060  7    study of multiple muscle groups. The case described
J15 0070  5    in this paper is that of an older man who developed
J15 0080  3    disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety
J15 0080 10    of steroids for a refractory anemia.
J15 0090  6    #REPORT OF CASE#
J15 0090  9    This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant
J15 0100  9    who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and
J15 0110  5    terminal admission on June 26, 1959, because of disabling
J15 0120  3    weakness and general debility.
J15 0120  7       In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia
J15 0130  5    for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period
J15 0140  5    of 4 years. Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956, and
J15 0150  2    a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed "scattered
J15 0150 11    foci of fibrosis" suggestive of myelofibrosis. No additional
J15 0160  8    transfusions were necessary after the institution of
J15 0170  7    prednisone in July, 1957, in an initial dose of 40
J15 0180  7    mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily. This
J15 0190  3    medication was continued until February, 1958.
J15 0200  1       In February, 1958, the patient suffered a myocardial
J15 0200  8    infarction complicated by pulmonary edema. Additional
J15 0210  5    findings at this time included cardiomegaly, peripheral
J15 0220  3    arteriosclerosis obliterans, and cholelithiasis. The
J15 0230  2    hemoglobin was 11.6 gm. Therapy included digitalization
J15 0230  9    and anticoagulation. Later, chlorothiazide and salt
J15 0240  6    restriction became necessary to control the edema of
J15 0250  7    chronic congestive failure.
J15 0260  1       Because of increasing anemia, triamcinolone, 8 mg.
J15 0260  8    daily, was started on Feb. 23, 1958, and was continued
J15 0270  8    until july, 1958. In september, 1958, the patient developed
J15 0280  5    generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent
J15 0290  3    with exacerbation of his anemia; the hemoglobin was
J15 0300  1    10.6 gm. In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend
J15 0300 11    by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any
J15 0310  7    hemolytic component, triamcinolone, 16 mg. daily, was
J15 0320  5    begun on Sept. 26, 1958, and continued until Feb. 18,
J15 0330  3    1959. At first the patient felt stronger, and the hemoglobin
J15 0340  1    rose to 13.8 gm., but on Oct. 20, 1958, he complained
J15 0340 12    of "caving in" in his knees. By Nov. 8, 1958, weakness,
J15 0350 10    specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature,
J15 0360  7    was pronounced, and a common complaint was "difficulty
J15 0370  4    in stepping up on to curbs". Prednisone, 30 mg. daily,
J15 0380  4    was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until
J15 0390  3    Dec. 1, 1958, without any improvement in the weakness.
J15 0390 12    Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter,
J15 0400 10    and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1, 1958, the
J15 0410  9    weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups
J15 0420  4    was appreciably worse, and it became difficult for
J15 0430  2    the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining
J15 0430 12    position. Triamcinolone, 16 mg. daily, was resumed
J15 0440  7    and maintained until Feb. 18, 1959. Chlorothiazide
J15 0450  4    was omitted for a 2-week period, but there was no change
J15 0460  4    in the muscle weakness.
J15 0460  8       At this time a detailed neuromuscular examination
J15 0470  3    revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in
J15 0480  3    the hands and feet, but marked in the shoulders, hips,
J15 0480 13    and pelvic girdle, with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes.
J15 0490  8    No fasciculations or sensory defects were found. Electromyography
J15 0500  7    revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease.
J15 0510  6    Thyroid function tests yielded normal results. The
J15 0520  3    protein-bound iodine was 6.6|mg. %, and the radioactive
J15 0530  1    iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46% in 24
J15 0530 11    hours, with a conversion ratio of 12%. A Schilling
J15 0540  9    test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin **f.
J15 0550  5    In February, 1959, during the second admission to The
J15 0560  4    New York Hospital, a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius
J15 0570  2    showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath
J15 0570  9    nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections.
J15 0580  8    Serial serum potassium levels remained normal; the
J15 0590  5    serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was 10 units
J15 0600  4    per ml. per min. The clinical impression at this time
J15 0610  2    was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis.
J15 0610  8       On Feb. 12, 1959, purified corticotropin (ACTH
J15 0620  6    Gel), 20 units daily intramuscularly, was started but
J15 0630  5    had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive
J15 0640  4    fluid retention. From March 3 to May 1, 1949, the patient
J15 0650  3    was maintained on dexamethasone, 3 to 6 mg. daily.
J15 0650 12    In May 1959, prednisone, 30 mg. daily, replaced the
J15 0660  9    dexamethasone. Muscle weakness did not improve, and
J15 0670  6    the patient needed first a cane, then crutches. In
J15 0680  3    spite of normal thyroid function tests, a trial of
J15 0680 12    propylthiouracil, 400 mg. daily for one week, was given
J15 0690  9    but served only to intensify muscle weakness. Repeated
J15 0700  6    attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful
J15 0710  4    because increased muscle weakness resulted, as well
J15 0720  3    as fever, malaise, anorexia, anxiety, and an exacerbation
J15 0720 11    of the anemia. These reactions were interpreted as
J15 0730  8    being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism.
J15 0740  3       Severe back pain in June, 1959, prompted a third
J15 0750  3    hospital admission. Extensive osteoporosis with partial
J15 0760  1    collapse of D8 was found. A high-protein diet, calcium
J15 0760 11    lactate supplements, and norethandrolone failed to
J15 0770  5    change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle
J15 0780  5    weakness.
J15 0780  6       The terminal hospital admission on June 27, 1959,
J15 0790  5    was necessitated by continued weakness and debility
J15 0800  1    complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed
J15 0800  8    hemorrhoids. X-ray films of the vertebral column showed
J15 0810  9    progression of the demineralization. On July 4, 1959,
J15 0820  5    the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension,
J15 0830  4    went into shock, and died.
J15 0830  9    #FINDINGS AT NECROPSY#
J15 0840  1    The body was that of a well-developed, somewhat debilitated
J15 0840 11    white man weighing 108 lb. There were bilateral pterygia
J15 0850  9    and arcus senilis, and the mouth was edentulous.
J15 0860  6       The heart weighed 510 gm., and at the outflow tracts
J15 0870  6    the left and right ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm.,
J15 0880  4    respectively. The coronary arteries were sclerotic
J15 0880 10    and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses, and
J15 0890  7    the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by
J15 0900  5    a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its
J15 0910  3    origin. The myocardium of the posterior base of the
J15 0910 12    left ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over
J15 0920  9    a 7.5 cm. area. The valves were normal except for thin
J15 0930  7    yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral
J15 0940  4    leaflets. Microscopically, sections from the posterior
J15 0950  1    base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several
J15 0950 11    large areas of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue.
J15 0960  8    In addition, other sections contained focal areas of
J15 0970  5    recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with
J15 0980  2    neutrophils. Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied
J15 0990  1    and had large, irregular, basophilic nuclei. The intima
J15 0990  9    of the larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous
J15 1000  8    tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells.
J15 1010  6       The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with
J15 1020  6    confluent, yellow-brown, hard, friable plaques along
J15 1030  2    its entire course, and there was a marked narrowing
J15 1030 11    of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries.
J15 1040  7    In particular, the orifices of the right renal and
J15 1050  6    celiac arteries were virtually occluded, and both calcified
J15 1060  3    common iliac arteries were completely occluded.
J15 1070  1       The lungs weighed together 950 gm. On the surfaces
J15 1070 10    of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring
J15 1080  6    up to 3 cm. in diameter. The parenchyma was slightly
J15 1090  5    hyperemic in the apex of the left lung, and there were
J15 1100  4    several firm, gray, fibrocalcific nodules measuring
J15 1100 10    as large as 3 mm. Microscopically, there was emphysema,
J15 1110  9    fibrosis, and vascular congestion. Macrophages laden
J15 1120  5    with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli,
J15 1130  6    and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened
J15 1140  2    by fibrous tissue.
J15 1140  5       The firm red spleen weighed 410 gm., and its surface
J15 1150  5    was mottled by discrete, small patches of white material.
J15 1160  2    The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent,
J15 1170  1    and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin.
J15 1170  8    Some of the sinusoids contained large numbers of nucleated
J15 1180  6    red cells, and cells of the granulocytic series were
J15 1190  4    found in small numbers. There were slight fibrosis
J15 1200  2    and marked arteriolosclerosis.
J15 1200  5       The liver weighed 2,090 gm., was brown in color,
J15 1210  6    and the cut surface was mottled by irregular pale areas.
J15 1220  3    Microscopically, there was hyperemia of the central
J15 1220 10    veins, and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma.
J15 1230  9    Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm,
J15 1240  5    while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin
J15 1250  4    pigment.
J15 1250  5       The gallbladder contained about 40 cc. of green-brown
J15 1260  6    bile and 3 smooth, dark-green calculi measuring up
J15 1270  2    to 1 cm. in diameter.
J15 1270  7       The mucosa of the stomach was atrophic and irregularly
J15 1280  4    blackened over a 14 cm. area. The small and large intestines
J15 1290  3    were filled with gas, and the jejunum was dilated to
J15 1300  1    about 2 times its normal circumference. The small intestine
J15 1300 10    and colon contained approximately 300 cc. of foul-smelling,
J15 1310  8    sanguineous material, and the mucosa throughout was
J15 1320  6    hyperemic and mottled green-brown. A careful search
J15 1330  4    failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels.
J15 1340  2    Microscopically, the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive
J15 1350  1    cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative
J15 1350  9    bacterial rods. The submucosa was focally infiltrated
J15 1360  6    with neutrophils. The mucosa of the jejunum and ileum
J15 1370  6    showed similar changes, and in some areas the submucosa
J15 1380  2    was edematous and contained considerable numbers of
J15 1380  9    neutrophils. Some of the small vessels were filled
J15 1390  8    with fibrin thrombi, and there was extensive interstitial
J15 1400  5    hemorrhage. A section of the colon revealed intense
J15 1410  3    hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa,
J15 1420  1    associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils. Cultures
J15 1420  9    taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans, Pseudomonas
J15 1430  8    pyocanea, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Streptococcus anhemolyticus.
J15 1440  5       The kidneys were pale and weighed right, 110 gm.,
J15 1450  8    and left, 230 gm. The surfaces were coarsely and finely
J15 1460  6    granular and punctuated by clear, fluid-filled cysts
J15 1470  2    measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter. On the surface of
J15 1480  2    the right kidney there were also 2 yellow, firm, friable
J15 1480 12    raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter. Microscopically,
J15 1490  9    both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which
J15 1500  8    there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, tubular
J15 1510  3    atrophy, and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma
J15 1520  3    cells. Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed
J15 1530  1    with neutrophils. Throughout, there were marked
J15 1530  7    arteriolosclerosis
J15 1540  1    and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles.
J15 1540  7    These changes were more marked in the atrophic right
J15 1550  8    kidney than in the left. In addition, there were 2
J15 1560  4    small papillary adenomas in the right kidney.
J15 1570  1       The bone of the vertebral bodies, ribs, and sternum
J15 1570 10    was soft and was easily compressed. The marrow of the
J15 1580  8    vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty
J15 1590  5    replacement. Microscopically, there were many areas
J15 1600  2    of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity.
J15 1610  1    The cells of the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic
J15 1610  9    series were normal except for their numbers. There
J15 1620  6    was no evidence of fibrosis. The muscles of the extremities,
J15 1630  5    chest wall, neck, and abdominal wall were soft, pale,
J15 1640  3    and atrophic.
J15 1640  5       Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius, pectoralis
J15 1650  2    major, transversus abdominis, biceps brachii, and diaphragm
J15 1660  1    showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury
J15 1660 10    ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis
J15 1670  7    of the muscle fibers. These changes were most marked
J15 1680  6    in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in
J15 1690  3    the pectoralis, diaphragm, and transversus.
J15 1690  8       In the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many
J15 1700  7    swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that
J15 1710  5    shown in Figure 2. Such swollen fibers were deeply
J15 1720  2    eosinophilic, contained a few pyknotic nuclei, and
J15 1720  9    showed loss of cross-striations, obliteration of myofibrils,
J15 1730  7    and prominent vacuolization. The necrosis often involved
J15 1740  5    only a portion of the length of a given fiber, and
J15 1750  5    usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal.
J15 1760  1    As shown in Figure 3, the protoplasm of other fibers
J15 1760 11    was pale, granular, or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes.
J15 1770  7    Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent. In association
J15 1780  6    with these changes in the fibers, there were striking
J15 1790  4    alterations in the muscle nuclei. These were increased
J15 1800  2    both in number and in size, contained prominent nucleoli,
J15 1810  1    and were distributed throughout the fiber (Figs. 2-5).
J15 1810 10    In contrast to the nuclear changes described above,
J15 1820  7    another change in muscle nuclei was seen, usually occurring
J15 1830  5    in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but
J15 1840  3    that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae.
J15 1850  1    The nuclei of these fibers, as is shown in Figures
J15 1850 11    3 and 4, showed remarkable proliferation and were closely
J15 1860  5    approximated, forming a chainlike structure at either
J15 1870  4    the center or the periphery of the fiber. Individual
J15 1880  1    nuclei were usually oval to round, though occasionally
J15 1880  9    elongated, and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic.
J15 1890  7    At times, clumps of 10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei
J15 1900  7    were also observed. Occasionally there were small basophilic
J15 1910  4    fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained
J15 1920  1    many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli (Fig.
J15 1920  8    5). These were thought to represent regenerating fibers.
J15 1930  7    Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved
J15 1940  7    muscles. In all of the sections examined, the arterioles
J15 1950  4    and small arteries were essentially normal.
