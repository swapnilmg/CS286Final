H16 0010  1       A former du Pont official became a General Motors
H16 0010 10    vice president and set about maximizing du Pont's share
H16 0020  8    of the General Motors market. Lines of communications
H16 0030  5    were established between the two companies and several
H16 0040  4    du Pont products were actively promoted. Within a few
H16 0050  3    years various du Pont manufactured items were filling
H16 0050 11    the entire requirements of from four to seven of General
H16 0060  9    Motors' eight operating divisions. The Fisher Body
H16 0070  5    division, long controlled by the Fisher brothers under
H16 0080  4    a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority
H16 0090  3    of its stock, followed an independent course for many
H16 0090 12    years, but by 1947 and 1948 "resistance had collapsed"
H16 0100  9    and its purchases from du Pont "compared favorably"
H16 0110  6    with purchases by other General Motors divisions. Competitors
H16 0120  4    came to receive higher percentage of General Motors
H16 0130  4    business in later years, but it is "likely" that this
H16 0140  3    trend stemmed "at least in part" from the needs of
H16 0140 13    General Motors outstripping du Pont's capacity. "
H16 0150  6       The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record
H16 0160  8    is that the bulk of du Pont's production has always
H16 0170  4    supplied the largest part of the requirements of the
H16 0180  3    one customer in the automobile industry connected to
H16 0180 11    du Pont by a stock interest. The inference is overwhelming
H16 0190  9    that du Pont's commanding position was promoted by
H16 0200  6    its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive
H16 0210  4    merit". 353 U. S., at 605.
H16 0220  1       This Court agreed with the trial court "that considerations
H16 0220  9    of price, quality and service were not overlooked by
H16 0230  8    either du Pont or General Motors". 353 U. S., at 606.
H16 0240  7    However, it determined that neither this factor, nor
H16 0250  5    "the fact that all concerned in high executive posts
H16 0260  2    in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each
H16 0260 10    in the honest conviction that his actions were in the
H16 0270  9    best interests of his own company and without any design
H16 0280  6    to overreach anyone, including du Pont's competitors",
H16 0290  2    353 U. S., at 607, outweighed the Government's claim
H16 0300  2    for relief. This claim, as submitted to the District
H16 0310  1    Court and dismissed by it, 126 F.Supp.235, alleged
H16 0310  9    violation not only of @ 7 of the Clayton Act, but also
H16 0320 12    of @ @ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The latter provisions
H16 0330  7    proscribe any contract, combination, or conspiracy
H16 0340  3    in restraint of interstate or foreign trade, and monopolization
H16 0350  2    of, or attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize,
H16 0360  1    such trade. However, this Court put to one side without
H16 0360 11    consideration the Government's appeal from the dismissal
H16 0370  7    of its Sherman Act allegations. It rested its decision
H16 0380  7    solely on @ 7, which reads in pertinent part: "
H16 0390  4       [N]o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire,
H16 0400  3    directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the
H16 0410  2    stock or other share capital of another corporation
H16 0410 10    engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such
H16 0420  7    acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition
H16 0430  3    between the corporation whose stock is so acquired
H16 0440  1    and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain
H16 0440 10    such commerce in any section or community, or tend
H16 0450  8    to create a monopoly of any line of commerce. @
H16 0460  5       This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing
H16 0470  2    such stock solely for investment and not using the
H16 0470 11    same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting
H16 0480 11    to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition
H16 0490  6    ...".
H16 0490  7       The purpose of this provision was thus explained
H16 0500  7    in the Court's opinion: "
H16 0510  1       Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency
H16 0510 10    not only the substantial lessening of competition from
H16 0520  7    the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or
H16 0530  5    any part of the stock of a competing corporation, but
H16 0540  2    also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies
H16 0550  1    in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability,
H16 0550 10    appear at the time of suit likely to result from the
H16 0570  9    acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of
H16 0580  7    the stock of any other corporation. The section is
H16 0590  2    violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies,
H16 0590 10    or the substantial lessening of competition, have occurred
H16 0600  6    or are intended ...". 353 U. S., at 589.
H16 0610  6       Thus, a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade
H16 0620  3    or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's
H16 0630  1    decision. Indeed, as already noted, the Court proceeded
H16 0630  9    on the assumption that the executives involved in the
H16 0640  7    dealings between du Pont and General Motors acted "honorably
H16 0650  6    and fairly" and exercised their business judgment only
H16 0660  5    to serve what they deemed the best interests of their
H16 0670  3    own companies. This, however, did not bar finding that
H16 0670 12    du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive
H16 0680 11    fabrics and finishes to General Motors; that these
H16 0690  7    products constituted a "line of commerce" within the
H16 0700  5    meaning of the Clayton Act; that General Motors' share
H16 0710  3    of the market for these products was substantial; and
H16 0720  2    that competition for this share of the market was endangered
H16 0730  1    by the financial relationship between the two concerns:
H16 0730  9    "
H16 0740  1       The statutory policy of fostering free competition
H16 0740  7    is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage
H16 0750  7    over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's
H16 0760  4    stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute.
H16 0770  4    We repeat, that the test of a violation of @ 7 is whether,
H16 0780  2    at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability
H16 0780 12    that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned
H16 0790 10    restraints. The conclusion upon this record is inescapable
H16 0800  7    that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition
H16 0810  5    ...". 353 U. S., at 607.
H16 0810 11       On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion,
H16 0820 11    the Court remanded the case to the District Court to
H16 0830  8    determine the appropriate relief. The sole guidance
H16 0840  5    given the Court for discharging the task committed
H16 0850  1    to it was this: "
H16 0850  5       The judgment must therefore be reversed and the
H16 0860  3    cause remanded to the District Court for a determination,
H16 0870  1    after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary
H16 0870  9    and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate
H16 0880  7    the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute.
H16 0890  5    The District Courts, in the framing of equitable decrees,
H16 0900  4    are clothed 'with large discretion to model their judgments
H16 0910  3    to fit the exigencies of the particular case'. International
H16 0920  1    Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392, 400-401".
H16 0940  3    353 U. S., at 607-608.
H16 0940  9       This brings us to the course of the proceedings
H16 0950  5    in the District Court.
H16 0950  9    #II.#
H16 0950 10    This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court
H16 0960  9    on July 18, 1957. The first pretrial conference- held
H16 0970  7    to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of
H16 0980  6    the stockholders of du Pont and General Motors and
H16 0990  3    to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent
H16 1000  1    hearings- took place on September 25, 1957. At the
H16 1000  9    outset, the Government's spokesman explained that counsel
H16 1010  6    for the Government and for du Pont had already held
H16 1020  8    preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at
H16 1030  4    a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the
H16 1030 14    court. Du Pont, he said, had proposed disenfranchisement
H16 1040  8    of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions
H16 1050  7    on the du Pont-General Motors relationship. The Government,
H16 1060  5    deeming these suggestions inadequate, had urged that
H16 1070  4    any judgment include divestiture of du Pont's shares
H16 1080  2    of General Motors. Counsel for the Government invited
H16 1090  1    du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending
H16 1090  9    a specific program, but stated that if the court desired,
H16 1100  8    or if counsel for du Pont thought further discussion
H16 1110  4    would not be profitable, the Government was prepared
H16 1120  3    to submit a plan within thirty days.
H16 1120 10       Counsel for du Pont indicated a preference for the
H16 1130  8    submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early
H16 1140  6    date. No previous antitrust case, he said, had involved
H16 1150  2    interests of such magnitude or presented such complex
H16 1150 10    problems of relief. The submission of detailed plans
H16 1160  8    would place the issues before the court more readily
H16 1170  6    than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement
H16 1180  3    in the abstract. The Court adopted this procedure with
H16 1190  2    an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.
H16 1190 10       The Government submitted its proposed decree on
H16 1200  7    October 25, 1957. The plan called for divestiture by
H16 1210  6    du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors
H16 1220  2    stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders,
H16 1230  1    as a dividend, over a period of ten years. Christiana
H16 1230 11    Securities Company and Delaware Realty + Investment
H16 1240  6    Company, major stockholders in du Pont, and the stockholders
H16 1250  7    of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions
H16 1260  3    requiring the annual sale by a trustee, again over
H16 1270  1    a ten-year period, of du Pont's General Motors stock
H16 1270 11    allocable to them, as well as any General Motors stock
H16 1280  9    which Christiana and Delaware owned outright. If, in
H16 1290  5    the trustee's judgment, "reasonable market conditions"
H16 1300  3    did not prevail during any given year, he was to be
H16 1310  2    allowed to petition the court for an extension of time
H16 1310 12    within the ten-year period. In addition, the right
H16 1320  8    to vote the General Motors stock held by du Pont was
H16 1330  7    to be vested in du Pont's stockholders, other than
H16 1340  3    Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware;
H16 1350  1    du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were to be enjoined
H16 1350 10    from acquiring stock in or exercising control over
H16 1360  7    General Motors; du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were
H16 1370  5    to be prohibited to have any director or officer in
H16 1380  4    common with General Motors, and vice versa; and General
H16 1390  2    Motors and du Pont were to be ordered to terminate
H16 1390 12    any agreement that provided for the purchase by General
H16 1400  8    Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements
H16 1410  5    of any du Pont manufactured product, or for the grant
H16 1420  5    of exclusive patent rights, or for a grant by General
H16 1430  1    Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or
H16 1430 12    sell any chemical discovery of General Motors, or for
H16 1440  8    the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise
H16 1450  4    by the two companies.
H16 1450  8       On motion of the amici curiae, the court directed
H16 1460  5    that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of
H16 1470  4    Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences
H16 1480  2    of the Government's plan. On May 9, 1958, the Commissioner
H16 1490  1    announced his rulings. The annual dividends paid to
H16 1490  9    du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock
H16 1500  8    would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
H16 1510  6    du Pont's earnings and profits. The measure, for federal
H16 1520  4    income tax purposes, of the dividend to individual
H16 1530  1    stockholders would be the fair market value of the
H16 1530 10    shares at the time of each annual distribution. In
H16 1540  6    the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders, the measure
H16 1550  3    would be the lesser of the fair market value of the
H16 1560  3    shares or du Pont's tax basis for them, which is approximately
H16 1570  1    $2.09 per share. The forced sale of the General Motors
H16 1570 11    stock owned by or allocable to Christiana, Delaware,
H16 1580  7    and the stockholders of Delaware, and deposited with
H16 1590  5    the trustee, would result in a tax to those parties
H16 1600  2    at the capital gains rate.
H16 1600  7       Du Pont's counterproposal was filed on May 14, 1958.
H16 1610  7    Under its plan du Pont would retain its General Motors
H16 1620  4    shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders
H16 1630  1    the right to vote those shares. Christiana and Delaware
H16 1630 10    would, in turn, be required to pass on the voting rights
H16 1640 11    to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their
H16 1650  7    own stockholders. Du Pont would be enjoined from having
H16 1660  5    as a director, officer, or employee anyone who was
H16 1670  3    simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors,
H16 1670 11    and no director, officer, or employee of du Pont could
H16 1680 10    serve as a director of General Motors without court
H16 1690  6    approval. Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire
H16 1700  5    any additional General Motors stock except through
H16 1710  2    General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription
H16 1710  9    rights to its stockholders.
H16 1720  4       On June 6, 1958, General Motors submitted its objections
H16 1730  3    to the Government's proposal. It argued, inter alia,
H16 1740  2    that a divestiture order would severely depress the
H16 1740 10    market value of the stock of both General Motors and
H16 1750 10    du Pont, with consequent serious loss and hardship
H16 1760  5    to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors, among
H16 1770  3    them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions;
H16 1780  1    that there would be a similar decline in the market
H16 1780 11    values of other automotive and chemical stocks, with
H16 1790  7    similar losses to the stockholders of those companies;
H16 1800  4    that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock
H16 1810  3    hanging over the market for ten years would hamper
H16 1810 12    the efforts of General Motors and other automobile
H16 1820  7    manufacturers to raise equity capital; and that all
H16 1830  6    this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire
H16 1840  4    stock market and on general business activity. General
H16 1850  1    Motors comprehensively contended that the Government
H16 1850  7    plan would not be "in the public interest" as required
H16 1860  9    by the mandate of this Court.
H16 1870  2       The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed
H16 1880  1    in August of 1958. These plans, like du Pont's contained
H16 1880 11    provisions for passing the vote on du Pont's General
H16 1890  9    Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du
H16 1900  7    Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, except that officers
H16 1910  4    and directors of the three companies, their spouses,
H16 1920  1    and other people living in their households, as well
H16 1920 10    as other specified persons, were to be totally disenfranchised.
H16 1930  7    Both plans also prohibited common directors, officers,
H16 1940  4    or employees between du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware,
H16 1950  3    on the one hand, and General Motors on the other.
