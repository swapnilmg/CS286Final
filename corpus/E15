E15 0010  1    _NOTE:_
E15 0010  2       Directions are written for those who have had previous
E15 0020  1    experience in making pottery. Instructions for preparing
E15 0020  8    clay, drying, glazing and firing are not given.
E15 0030  7    #EQUIPMENT:#
E15 0030  8    Basic pottery studio equipment. Wooden butter molds
E15 0040  6    and cookie presses.
E15 0040  9    #MATERIALS:#
E15 0050  1    Ceramic modeling clay: red, white or buff. Stoneware
E15 0050  9    clay for tiles. Glazes, one-stroke ceramic colors,
E15 0060  8    stains, cones as indicated in the individual instructions.
E15 0070  5    #GENERAL DIRECTIONS:#
E15 0070  7    Use well-wedged clay, free of air bubbles and pliable
E15 0090  7    enough to bend without cracking. Clean wooden molds
E15 0100  5    and presses thoroughly; they must be free of oil, wax
E15 0110  5    and dust.
E15 0110  7    _PRESSING DESIGNS:_
E15 0110  9       The size of wooden mold will determine the amount
E15 0120  6    of clay needed. Roll clay to thickness indicated in
E15 0130  3    individual instructions. Whenever possible, use the
E15 0140  1    wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay. When mold
E15 0140 11    has more than one design cavity, make individual paper
E15 0150  6    patterns. Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay
E15 0160  5    and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position
E15 0170  1    (cut more pieces than required for project to make
E15 0170 10    allowance for defects; experiment with defects for
E15 0180  6    decoration techniques of glazes and colors). Place
E15 0190  4    the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design
E15 0200  2    side of wooden mold. To obtain clear impression of
E15 0200 11    mold, press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity,
E15 0210  8    starting at center and working to outer edges. Trim
E15 0220  5    excess clay away from outer edges. Check thickness
E15 0230  1    of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface
E15 0230 11    with a little water and adding small pieces of clay.
E15 0240  8    Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place
E15 0250  5    without locking in air bubbles. Allow project to stand
E15 0260  4    for about five minutes (if wooden press mold is a good
E15 0270  1    antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness
E15 0270 12    may cause mold to crack).
E15 0280  3       To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped
E15 0290  1    position around project; gently lift the edge on far
E15 0290 10    side, then continue to release edge completely around
E15 0300  6    mold. Slight tapping on the underside of mold will
E15 0310  5    help release the clay, but too much agitation will
E15 0320  1    cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with
E15 0320 11    removal of clay from mold. Place a piece of plaster
E15 0330  8    wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat,
E15 0340  5    clay and mold in one action. This will prevent the
E15 0350  2    clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when
E15 0350 10    fired. Place project on table and carefully lift the
E15 0360  8    mold off. Study surface of clay for defects or desired
E15 0370  5    corrections. If clay is slightly out of shape, square
E15 0380  2    straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed
E15 0380 10    against opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with
E15 0390  8    damp fingers. if the background of design is too smooth,
E15 0400  6    or you wish to create a wood-grained effect, it may
E15 0410  3    be added at this time with a dull tool such as the
E15 0410 15    handle of a fine paintbrush. Make slight, smooth grooves
E15 0420  9    rather than cuts for the texture (cuts could cause
E15 0430  7    air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters
E15 0440  4    in the glaze during firing). Leave the clay on plaster
E15 0450  2    board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece
E15 0450 12    of plastic or cloth to prevent warping.
E15 0460  6    #RECTANGULAR TILES#
E15 0460  8    (opposite page, right top): Stoneware clay was used.
E15 0470  7    Clay was rolled to 1/4'' thickness. Back of clay scored
E15 0480  6    or roughened for proper gripping surface. No bisque
E15 0490  4    firing. glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware
E15 0500  2    glaze (no glaze on sides or bottom). Decorated on unfired
E15 0510  1    glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors; raised
E15 0510 11    details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green,
E15 0520  9    blue-green, brown and pink. Tiles were fired once to
E15 0530  7    cone 05.
E15 0530  9    #ROUND PLAQUE#
E15 0530 11    (opposite page, bottom): White clay was used, rolled
E15 0540  8    to 1/4'' thickness. Bisque fired to cone 05. Stained
E15 0550  7    with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired stain, polished, following
E15 0560  4    manufacturer's directions. Opaque cantaloupe and transparent
E15 0570  3    wood brown were used. No further firing.
E15 0570 10    #PAPERWEIGHT#
E15 0580  1    (opposite page, top left): Red clay was used, rolled
E15 0590  1    1/2'' thick. Mold was used as pattern and clay cut
E15 0600 10    by holding knife at about 45` angle, to form an undercut,
E15 0610  9    making base smaller than the pattern top. While clay
E15 0620  5    is still pressed in mold, press three equally spaced
E15 0630  2    holes 1/4'' deep, using pencil eraser, in bottom of
E15 0630 11    clay to allow for proper drying and firing. Paperweight
E15 0640  9    may be personalized on back while clay is leather hard.
E15 0650  8    Bisque fired to cone 05. Unglazed.
E15 0651  1    #JARS WITH LIDS#
E15 0660  1    (opposite page, top left): Remove wooden design head
E15 0670  3    from bowl of butter mold. Fill small hole in bowl with
E15 0670 14    clay. Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid
E15 0680 10    (see Fig. 1, opposite page). Measurements for rectangular
E15 0690  3    pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference
E15 0700  5    and depth of butter mold bowl. Pattern for circular
E15 0710  4    base piece B is diameter of A. Use wooden design
E15 0720  2    head of mold for pattern C; pattern D for lid fits
E15 0730  1    over top diameter of A. Pattern for inner lid piece
E15 0730 11    E fits inside A. Jars are assembled in bowl of butter
E15 0740 10    mold.
E15 0740 11       Use white or buff clay, rolled to 3/16'' thickness.
E15 0750  9    Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with
E15 0760  9    knife in vertical position. Place clay pieces on wall
E15 0770  5    board.
E15 0770  6       To assemble jar, put paper pattern B for base in
E15 0780  5    bottom of mold and clay disk B on top. Line sides
E15 0790  2    of mold with paper pattern A. Bevel and score ends
E15 0790 12    of clay piece A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and
E15 0800 10    make even thickness. Place clay piece A inside; use
E15 0810  7    slip to join overlapped ends together. Join B to bottom
E15 0820  6    of A, scoring and reinforcing with clay coil. Trim
E15 0830  4    excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while
E15 0840  2    assembling lid.
E15 0840  4       To assemble lid, press clay piece C in cavity of
E15 0850  4    wooden design head. Press clay into mold as instructed
E15 0860  1    in General Directions. Score plain side of C and leave
E15 0860 11    in mold. Score one side of disk D, join to C; score
E15 0870 11    other side of D and one side of disk E and join as
E15 0880 10    before. While assembled lid is still on design head,
E15 0890  6    gently but firmly press it on plaster board. If design
E15 0891  3    head has a deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick
E15 0900  9    at this point; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4''
E15 0910  8    deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying
E15 0920  7    and firing. Check fit of lid on jar; if inner lid is
E15 0930  5    too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness of
E15 0940  2    glaze. Remove lid from head of mold. Remove jar from
E15 0940 12    mold. Place jar on plaster board with lid in place
E15 0950  9    to dry slowly. Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar.
E15 0960  7       For an antique effect on jars, brush Creek-Turn
E15 0970  3    brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off. Glaze
E15 0970 13    with two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze.
E15 0980  9    The large jar was brushed with Creek-Turn green toner
E15 0990  6    and sponged off. Glaze with two coats of matt glazes
E15 1000  4    in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid. When
E15 1010  1    dry they were fired to cone 06-05.
E15 1010  9    #LITTLE FOLKS SET:#
E15 1010 12    (Made from modern wooden molds **f.) Roll white clay
E15 1030  4    to 3/16'' thickness.
E15 1040  1    _SALT AND PEPPER:_
E15 1040  4       Use mold to cut four side pieces. For top and bottom
E15 1050  4    pieces, use short end of mold as measurement guide.
E15 1050 13    Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold.
E15 1060 10    Trim excess clay from rim of mold. Cut beveled edge
E15 1080  6    on the long sides of clay at a 45` angle to miter corners.
E15 1090  4    Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold; place
E15 1100  2    design-side up on plaster board. Make all four sides.
E15 1100 12    Cut clay top and base pieces; place on plaster board.
E15 1110  9    Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing
E15 1120  6    shaker.
E15 1120  7    _TO ASSEMBLE:_
E15 1130  1       Construct sides, bottom and top as for box, using
E15 1130 10    slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce
E15 1140  7    seams. Join the four sides together first, then add
E15 1150  4    the base; add top last. Use water on finger to smooth
E15 1160  1    seams and edges. Turn shaker upside down. Recess base
E15 1160 10    slightly to allow room for stopper. Cut hole in base
E15 1170  9    for cork stopper. Add holes in top, forming "S" for
E15 1180  6    salt and "P" for pepper. Set aside to dry thoroughly.
E15 1190  5    _SUGAR AND CREAMER:_
E15 1190  8       Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide
E15 1200  8    enough for three impressions of mold design. Press
E15 1210  3    clay into cavity of one mold three times; bevel overlapping
E15 1220  1    ends for splice joint, score beveled edges. Form clay
E15 1220 10    strip into a cylinder; use slip to join scored ends.
E15 1230 10    Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than
E15 1240  8    cylinder. Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to
E15 1250  4    disk with slip. Trim away excess clay; reinforce seam
E15 1260  2    with a coil of clay. This will form the sugar bowl.
E15 1260 13    Make creamer the same.
E15 1270  3       Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide
E15 1280  1    and 3-1/2'' long. To add handle, place a wooden dowel
E15 1280 12    against the inside wall of creamer. Score outside of
E15 1290  9    container where handle ends will be joined. Bend handle;
E15 1310  2    press scored handle ends firmly in place using dowel
E15 1320  4    to reinforce container while pressing; use slip to
E15 1330  1    join. To form spout, between two designs, dampen area
E15 1330 10    slightly and gently push clay outward. Make lid for
E15 1340  8    sugar bowl the same as jar lids, omitting design disk.
E15 1341  4    Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired. Set
E15 1360  2    aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl.
E15 1360 10    _VASES:_
E15 1360 11       Make same as salt and pepper shakers, leaving off
E15 1370  8    top pieces. Vases may be made into candles by filling
E15 1380  5    with melted wax and a wick.
E15 1390  1    _NAPKIN HOLDER:_
E15 1390  1       Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each
E15 1390 13    about **f (long enough for three impressions of mold).
E15 1400  7    Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three times.
E15 1410  7    Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard
E15 1420  5    state. Score side edges of base; join sides and base
E15 1430  3    with slip and reinforce with coil. A cardboard pattern
E15 1430 12    cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping.
E15 1440  9    Place pattern inside holder; use three strips of clay
E15 1450  7    to hold in place (see Fig. 2, page 71). Do not use
E15 1460  7    wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would
E15 1470  2    cause breakage.
E15 1470  4       Let all projects dry slowly for several days. Clean
E15 1480  3    greenware. Bisque fire to cone 08. Inside of pieces
E15 1490  1    was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green
E15 1490 11    antique glaze. Outside was finished with Creek-Turn
E15 1500  7    brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique
E15 1510  5    finish. Fired to cone 06-05.
E15 1520  1    #CHANGING COLORS#
E15 1530  1    _TO CHANGE FROM ONE COLOR YARN TO ANOTHER:_
E15 1530  1       When changing from one color to another, whether
E15 1530  9    working on right or wrong side, pick up the new strand
E15 1540  8    from underneath dropped strand. Photograph shows the
E15 1550  3    wrong side of work with light strand being picked up
E15 1560  2    under dark strand in position to be purled.
E15 1570  1    _TO MEASURE WORK:_
E15 1570  1       Spread article on flat surface to required width
E15 1570  9    before measuring length at center.
E15 1580  4    #MEASURING ARMHOLE#
E15 1580  6    _TO MEASURE ARMHOLE:_
E15 1585  1       Mark row on which first stitches have been bound
E15 1590  4    off for armhole by drawing a contrasting colored thread
E15 1600  5    through it. Place work on a flat surface and smooth
E15 1610  3    out. Measure straight up from marked row. See illustration.
E15 1620  1    _TO INSERT MARKERS:_
E15 1620  4       When directions read "sl a marker on needle", put
E15 1630  5    a small safety pin, paper clip, or commercial ring
E15 1640  2    marker on needle. In working, always slip marker from
E15 1640 11    one needle to another. To mark a row or stitch, tie
E15 1650 10    contrasting thread around end of row or stitch to be
E15 1660  7    marked.
E15 1660  8    #BACKSTITCHING SEAM#
E15 1670  1    _TO SEW SEAMS WITH BACKSTITCH:_
E15 1670  3       Most seams are sewn with backstitch, especially
E15 1680  1    on curved, slanted or loose edges. Pin right sides
E15 1680 10    of pieces together, keeping edges even and matching
E15 1690  6    rows or patterns. Thread matching yarn in tapestry
E15 1700  4    needle. Run end of yarn through several stitches along
E15 1710  2    edge to secure; backstitch pieces together close to
E15 1710 10    edge. Do not draw yarn too tight. See illustration.
E15 1730  1    _TO SEW IN SLEEVES:_
E15 1730  1       Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center
E15 1730  9    of sleeve cap at shoulder seam. Ease in any extra fullness
E15 1740  7    evenly around. Backstitch seam.
E15 1750  1    #WEAVING SEAM#
E15 1750  3    _TO WEAVE SEAMS TOGETHER:_
E15 1750  7       Straight vertical edges, such as those at the back
E15 1760  8    seam of a sock, can be woven together invisibly. Thread
E15 1770  3    matching yarn in tapestry needle. Hold edges together,
E15 1780  2    right side up.
