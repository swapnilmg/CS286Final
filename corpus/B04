B04 0010  1    #A SHOCK WAVE FROM AFRICA#
B04 0010  6    WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane
B04 0020  5    crash has sent a shockwave around the globe. As head
B04 0030  3    of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace,
B04 0030 14    and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs
B04 0040 11    precariously. It was on the eve of a momentous U.N.
B04 0050  8    session to come to grips with cold war issues. His
B04 0060  4    firm hand will be desperately missed.
B04 0060 10       Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace.
B04 0070 10    He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist
B04 0080  7    president of Congo's Katanga province where recent
B04 0090  4    fighting had been bloody. He earnestly urged a cease-fire.
B04 0100  5       The story of the fatal crash is not fully known.
B04 0110  2    The U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the
B04 0110 11    conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been
B04 0120  9    riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was
B04 0130  6    newly repaired. Whether this, or overt action, was
B04 0150  4    the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.
B04 0160  1       The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United
B04 0160  9    Nations' most controversial leader. He was controversial
B04 0170  7    because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom
B04 0180  5    with justice. He courageously defended the rights of
B04 0190  4    small nations, and he stood his ground against the
B04 0200  1    savage attacks of the Communist bloc.
B04 0200  7       The Congo, in whose cause he died, was the scene
B04 0210  6    of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies had resolved
B04 0220  3    the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war
B04 0230  1    and workable solutions were beginning to take shape.
B04 0230  9    When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these
B04 0240  5    solutions Mr. Hammarskjold, despite the danger, flew
B04 0250  4    to exert a calming influence. He gave his life for
B04 0260  2    his beliefs.
B04 0260  4       The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under
B04 0270  4    the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with
B04 0280  1    the world on the edge of momentous developments.
B04 0280  9       If the manner of his passing moves the nations to
B04 0290  8    act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues
B04 0300  4    that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason
B04 0310  1    and justice. That is the hope of mankind.
B04 0310  9    #MONUMENT TO TOGETHERNESS#
B04 0320  1    REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole
B04 0320 10    community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest
B04 0330  9    tasks. Too many have bogged down in bickering. Even
B04 0340  8    when public bodies arrived at a consensus, at least
B04 0350  5    one dissenting vote has been usual.
B04 0350 11       So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.
B04 0360  9    All nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority
B04 0370  6    voted for Goodbody + Company's proposal to finance
B04 0380  4    the long-awaited trade and cultural center.
B04 0390  1       The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell
B04 0390 11    out the terms of its contract. If the indenture is
B04 0400  8    accepted, the authority will proceed to validate a
B04 0410  5    bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody will
B04 0420  2    hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing
B04 0420 11    the spacious Graves Tract to house the center.
B04 0430  7       The next step awaits approval today by the Metro
B04 0440  6    commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port
B04 0450  3    Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to
B04 0460  1    support Interama until its own financing could be arranged.
B04 0460 10    Less than half the sum has been spent, since the Interama
B04 0470 10    board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking
B04 0480  6    negotiations. The balance is being budgeted for the
B04 0490  4    coming year.
B04 0490  6       Unanimity on Interama is not surprising. It is one
B04 0500  5    of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone
B04 0510  2    is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior
B04 0510 12    claim of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear
B04 0520 10    the way for the project. County officials have cooperated
B04 0530  5    consistently. So have the people's elected spokesmen
B04 0540  3    at the state and federal levels.
B04 0540  9       Interama, as it rises, will be a living monument
B04 0550  9    to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile
B04 0560  6    enterprises.
B04 0560  7    #A SHORT REPORT AND A GOOD ONE#
B04 0570  4    PROGRESS, or lack of it, toward civil rights in the
B04 0580  2    50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation
B04 0580 12    issued last week by the United States Commission on
B04 0590  9    Civil Rights.
B04 0600  1       Much happened in this field during the past 12 months.
B04 0600 11    Each state advisory committee documented its own activity.
B04 0610  7    Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the
B04 0620  6    shortest of all, requiring only four paragraphs.
B04 0630  2       "The established pattern of relative calm in the
B04 0640  1    field of race relations has continued in all areas",
B04 0640 10    reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville
B04 0650  8    and including two South Floridians, William D. Singer
B04 0660  5    and John B. Turner of Miami.
B04 0670  1       "No complaints or charges have been filed during
B04 0670  9    the past year, either verbally or written, from any
B04 0680  8    individual or group.
B04 0690  1       "The committee continues to feel that Florida has
B04 0690  9    progressed in a sound and equitable program at both
B04 0700  9    the state and local levels in its efforts to review
B04 0710  5    and assess transition problems as they arise from time
B04 0720  2    to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights".
B04 0720 11       Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but
B04 0730  8    have been handled in most cases with understanding
B04 0740  4    and restraint. The progress reported by the advisory
B04 0750  2    committee is real. While some think we move too fast
B04 0750 12    and others too slowly, Florida's record is a good one
B04 0760  9    and stands out among the 50.
B04 0770  3    #WEST GERMANY REMAINS WESTERN#
B04 0770  7    WEST GERMANY will face the crucial tests that lie ahead,
B04 0780  8    on Berlin and unification, with a coalition government.
B04 0790  4    This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national
B04 0800  2    election.
B04 0800  3       Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party
B04 0810  2    slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough
B04 0820  1    to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed
B04 0820 10    since 1957. In order to form a new government it must
B04 0830  9    deal with one of the two rival parties which gained
B04 0840  4    strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.
B04 0850  1       The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired.
B04 0850 10    Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22
B04 0860  8    seats in the new parliament, and the Free Democrats,
B04 0870  7    who picked up 23, will insist on that before they enter
B04 0880  6    the government.
B04 0880  8       Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart, the economic expert, probably
B04 0890  6    will ascend to the leadership long denied him.
B04 0900  4       If he becomes chancellor, Dr. Erhart would make
B04 0910  2    few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's
B04 0910 10    astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free
B04 0920  8    enterprise. He is dedicated to building the nation's
B04 0930  5    strength and, as are all West Germans, to a free Berlin
B04 0940  5    and to reunion with captive East Germany.
B04 0950  1       What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies
B04 0950 12    consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition
B04 0960  9    that will result.
B04 0970  1       If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per
B04 0970 10    cent of the vote, approaches the party of Willy Brandt,
B04 0980  7    which won 36 per cent, the result would be a stiffening
B04 0990  5    of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously
B04 1000  3    demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his
B04 1010  1    city and won votes by it.
B04 1010  7       The Free Democrats (12 per cent of the vote) believe
B04 1020  5    a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the
B04 1030  2    Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist
B04 1030 10    bloc.
B04 1040  1       The question left by the election is whether West
B04 1040 10    Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more
B04 1050  6    flexibility. It could go either way, since the gains
B04 1060  5    for both points of view were about the same.
B04 1070  1       Regardless of the decision two facts are clear.
B04 1070  9    West Germany, with its industrial and military might,
B04 1080  6    reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the
B04 1090  4    free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer, who
B04 1100  2    upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which
B04 1105  1    Bismarck began, draws near the end.
B04 1110  6    #BETTER ASK BEFORE JOINING#
B04 1110 10    AMERICANS are a nation of joiners, a quality which
B04 1120  9    our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing. But
B04 1130  5    it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make
B04 1140  4    a spectacle of himself.
B04 1140  8       For instance, so-called "conservative" organizations,
B04 1150  3    some of them secret, are sprouting in the garden of
B04 1160  5    joining where "liberal" organizations once took root.
B04 1170  2       One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which
B04 1180  1    will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle
B04 1180  8    is commendable but we suspect that in the practice
B04 1190  8    somebody is going to get gulled.
B04 1200  2       According to The Chicago Tribune News Service, State
B04 1210  2    Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a
B04 1210 11    series of questions which the joiner might well ask
B04 1220  9    about any organization seeking his money and his name:
B04 1230  7    _1._
B04 1230  8       Does it assail schools and churches with blanket
B04 1240  5    accusations?
B04 1240  6    _2._
B04 1240  7       Does it attack other traditional American institutions
B04 1250  4    with unsupportable and wild charges?
B04 1260  1    _3._
B04 1260  2       Does it put the label of un-American or subversive
B04 1260 12    on everyone with whom it disagrees politically?
B04 1270  7    _4._
B04 1270  8       Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming
B04 1280  7    American statesmen for wars, communism, depression,
B04 1290  3    and other troubles of the world?
B04 1290  9    _5._
B04 1290 10       Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such
B04 1300  8    means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing
B04 1310  5    campaigns?
B04 1310  6    _6._
B04 1310  7       Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount
B04 1320  7    of money they collect than in the principles they purport
B04 1330  4    to advocate?
B04 1330  6       In some instances a seventh question can be added:
B04 1340  5    _7._
B04 1340  6       Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign
B04 1350  5    government, political party or personality in opposition
B04 1360  1    or preference to the American system?
B04 1360  7       If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is
B04 1370  7    not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking
B04 1380  4    to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions
B04 1390  2    of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere
B04 1400  1    in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas-
B04 1400 10    difficult to see but undeniably there, nevertheless-
B04 1410  7    is the tropical green "city" of Islandia, a string
B04 1420  6    of offshore islands that has almost no residents, limited
B04 1430  4    access and an unlimited future. The latter is what
B04 1440  2    concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from
B04 1440 12    the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward,
B04 1450  8    belongs to someone- people who have title to the land.
B04 1460  7    And what you can't see, the land underneath the water,
B04 1470  4    belongs to someone, too. The public. The only real
B04 1480  2    problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the
B04 1480 13    above-water land can develop their property without
B04 1490  7    the public losing its underwater land and the right
B04 1500  5    to its development for public use and enjoyment. In
B04 1510  2    the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the
B04 1510 11    developers of waterfront land have too often wound
B04 1520  8    up with both their land and ours. In this instance,
B04 1530  4    happily, insistence is being made that our share is
B04 1540  2    protected. And until this protection is at least as
B04 1540 11    concrete as, say, the row of hotels that bars us from
B04 1550 10    our own sands at Miami Beach, those who represent us
B04 1560  5    all should agree to nothing.
B04 1570  1    #CLOSED DOORS IN CITY HALL#
B04 1580  1    The reaction of certain City Council members to California's
B04 1590  2    newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was
B04 1590 12    disappointing.
B04 1600  1       We had assumed that at least this local legislative
B04 1610  1    body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections
B04 1610 11    to making the deliberations of its committees and the
B04 1620  8    city commissions available to the public.
B04 1630  4       In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes, collectively
B04 1640  2    known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that
B04 1650  1    "the public commissions, boards and councils and other
B04 1650  9    public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct
B04 1660 10    of the people's business. It is the intent of the law
B04 1670  8    that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations
B04 1680  4    be conducted openly.
B04 1680  7       "The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty
B04 1690  9    to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating
B04 1700  6    authority, do not give their public servants the right
B04 1710  4    to decide what is good for the people to know and what
B04 1720  2    is not good for them to know.
B04 1720  9       The full implementation of these noble words, however,
B04 1730  5    has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature.
B04 1740  3    Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting
B04 1750  1    guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted,
B04 1750  9    but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento
B04 1760  9    plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act.
B04 1770  6       Despite the lip service paid by local governments,
B04 1780  3    the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted
B04 1790  1    by reservations and rationalizations. When all else
B04 1790  8    fails, it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental
B04 1800  9    operations.
B04 1810  1       We submit that this is a most desirable effect of
B04 1810 11    the law- and one of its principal aims. Without public
B04 1820  7    scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would
B04 1830  5    no doubt be conducted more speedily. But the citizens
B04 1840  2    would, of course, never be sure that the decisions
B04 1840 11    that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious.
