B25 0010  1    THE MOST surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress
B25 0010 10    of the Soviet Communist Party is that it was surprising-
B25 0020 10    perhaps quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth
B25 0030 11    Congress of 1956, which ended with that famous "secret"
B25 0040  6    report on Stalin. The publication last July of the
B25 0050  5    party's Draft Program- that blueprint for the "transition
B25 0060  3    to communism"- had led the uninitiated to suppose that
B25 0070  2    this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis
B25 0080  1    of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of
B25 0080  9    ideas which had, in fact, been current over the last
B25 0090  7    three or four years (i.e., since the defeat of the
B25 0100  5    "anti-party group") in all theoretical party journals.
B25 0110  2    These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes
B25 0110 12    of Marx and Lenin "full communism" was still a very
B25 0120  9    distant ideal, the establishment of a Communist society
B25 0130  5    had now, under Khrushchev, become an "immediate and
B25 0140  4    tangible reality". It seems that Khrushchev himself
B25 0150  2    took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking
B25 0150 13    contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program
B25 0160  8    (a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent
B25 0170  8    Congress was, in fact, very largely a rehash of that
B25 0180  5    interminable document). He and other Soviet leaders
B25 0190  1    responsible for the document were proud of having brought
B25 0190 10    forward some new formulas, such as the early replacement
B25 0200  9    of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an "All People's
B25 0210  8    State", and also of having laid down the lines for
B25 0220  6    a much greater "democratization" of the whole hierarchy
B25 0230  4    of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.
B25 0240  1    Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary
B25 0240 10    blow at "bureaucracy" and would enable "the people"
B25 0250  7    to take a more direct and active part in running the
B25 0260  7    country. Also, elections would be more democratic;
B25 0270  3    there might even be two or more candidates for voters
B25 0280  1    to choose from.
B25 0280  4       No doubt, there was still a lot in the Draft Program-
B25 0290  1    and in Khrushchev's speech- which left many points
B25 0300  1    obscure. Was it the party's intention, for example,
B25 0300  9    to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace
B25 0310  6    it by uniformly wage-earning sovkhozes, i.e., state
B25 0320  4    farms (which were, moreover, to be progressively "urbanized")?
B25 0330  2    As we know, the Soviet peasant today still very largely
B25 0340  4    thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on
B25 0350  1    his private plot; and it is still very far from certain
B25 0350 12    how valid the party's claim is that in "a growing number
B25 0360 10    of kolkhozes" the peasants are finding it more profitable,
B25 0370  8    to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and
B25 0390  3    to let the latter be turned into something increasingly
B25 0400  2    like a state farm. If one follows the reports of the
B25 0410  1    Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable
B25 0410  9    uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves
B25 0420  8    about what exactly to do in this matter.
B25 0430  2       The Draft Program was interesting in other respects,
B25 0440  1    too. It contained, for example, a number of curious
B25 0440 10    admissions about the peasants, who enjoy no sickness
B25 0450  7    benefits, no old-age pensions, no paid holidays; they
B25 0460  5    still benefit far less than the "other" 50 per cent
B25 0470  3    of the nation from that "welfare state" which the Soviet
B25 0480  1    Union so greatly prides itself on being.
B25 0480  8    ##
B25 0480  9    OVER ALL these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was
B25 0490  6    to skate rather lightly; and, though he repeated, over
B25 0500  6    and over again, the spectacular figures of industrial
B25 0510  3    and agricultural production in 1980, the "ordinary"
B25 0520  1    people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to
B25 0520 11    how "communism" is really going to work in practice,
B25 0530  8    especially in respect of food. Would agriculture progress
B25 0540  4    as rapidly as industry? This was something on which
B25 0550  3    K. himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept
B25 0560  1    on threatening that he would "pull the ears" of those
B25 0560 11    responsible for agricultural production. And, as we
B25 0570  7    know, the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as
B25 0580  6    Khrushchev had hoped.
B25 0580  9       One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about
B25 0590  7    the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have
B25 0600  4    not at least something to do with one of the big surprises
B25 0610  3    provided by this Congress- the obsessive harping on
B25 0610 11    the crimes and misdeeds of the "anti-party group"-
B25 0620  9    Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and others- including
B25 0630  5    the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov. Molotov, in
B25 0640  4    particular, is being charged with all kinds of sins-
B25 0650  3    especially with wanting to cut down free public services,
B25 0660  1    to increase rents and fares; in fact, with having been
B25 0660 11    against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev
B25 0670  8    "welfare state". The trouble with all these doctrinal
B25 0680  7    quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story:
B25 0690  5    what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin, Molotov
B25 0700  2    had really proposed, we just don't know, and he has
B25 0700 12    had no chance to reply.
B25 0710  5    ##
B25 0710  6    BUT ONE cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop
B25 0720  6    harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated "anti-party"
B25 0730  3    group would be totally unnecessary if there were not,
B25 0740  1    inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition
B25 0740  9    to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual
B25 0750  7    methods to be employed in the "transition to communism"
B25 0760  4    and, last but not least, on foreign policy.
B25 0770  1       The whole problem of "peaceful coexistence and peaceful
B25 0780  1    competition" with the capitalist world is in the very
B25 0780 10    center of this Congress. Mikoyan declared:
B25 0790  4       "Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful
B25 0800  5    coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the state
B25 0810  2    of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment,
B25 0810 14    and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world
B25 0820 11    war. His views, in fact, coincide with those of foreign
B25 0830  7    enemies of peaceful coexistence, who look upon it merely
B25 0840  6    as a variant of the "cold war" or of an "armed peace"".
B25 0850  2       One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the
B25 0860  3    rest of the "anti-party group" are not being used as
B25 0860 14    China's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful
B25 0870  8    followers. For something, clearly, has gone very, very
B25 0880  7    seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations, which
B25 0890  3    were never easy, and have now deteriorated.
B25 0900  1       The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev,
B25 0900 10    together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov +
B25 0910  8    Co., has shifted the whole attention of the world,
B25 0920  5    including that of the Soviet people, from the "epoch-making"
B25 0930  4    twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict.
B25 0940  2    Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat
B25 0950  1    Khrushchev's attack on Albania as "something that we
B25 0950  9    cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach"
B25 0960  7    to the problem (i.e., as something thoroughly dictatorial
B25 0970  5    and "undemocratic"), but the Albanian leaders went
B25 0980  5    out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev,
B25 0990  2    calling him a liar, a bully, and so on. It is extremely
B25 1000  1    doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves
B25 1000 10    Communists could have done this without the direct
B25 1010  8    approval of their Chinese friends. The big question
B25 1020  4    is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet
B25 1030  1    solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the
B25 1030  9    Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev-
B25 1040  8    or get rid of Enver Hoxa. These seem about the only
B25 1050  8    two ways in which the "unhappy incident" can now be
B25 1060  5    closed.
B25 1060  6       But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise
B25 1070  5    between China and Russia. There are other symptoms.
B25 1080  2    Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about
B25 1080  9    the inevitable decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable
B25 1090  7    to "peaceful coexistence" and would like, above all,
B25 1100  6    the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully;
B25 1110  5    he knows that he was never more popular than at the
B25 1120  3    time of the Russo-American "honeymoon" of 1959. But
B25 1130  1    it seems that pressures against him are coming from
B25 1130 10    somewhere- in the first place from China, but perhaps
B25 1140  7    also from that "China Lobby" which, I was assured in
B25 1150  6    Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on the quiet inside
B25 1160  4    the party. To these people, solidarity and unity with
B25 1170  1    China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy.
B25 1170 11    And the Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have
B25 1180  8    strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure
B25 1190  6    a "shameful" peace with the West. The fact that China
B25 1200  5    (which is obsessed by Formosa- to Khrushchev a very
B25 1210  3    small matter) should be supported by North Korea and
B25 1210 12    North Vietnam is highly indicative. And one cannot
B25 1220  8    but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky, who was blowing
B25 1230  4    hot and cold, exalting peace but also almost openly
B25 1240  4    considering the possibility of preventive war against
B25 1250  1    the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet.
B25 1250 10    And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton
B25 1260  4    bomb. Was not this dropped primarily in order to "appease"
B25 1270  6    the Chinese- especially after "Khrushchev's "humiliating"
B25 1280  3    surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty
B25 1290  5    deadline of December 31?
B25 1290  9       What does it all add up to? Indications are that
B25 1300 10    Khrushchev (and, with him, the bulk of the Soviet people)
B25 1310  8    favor peaceful coexistence and (with the exception
B25 1320  3    of Berlin) the maintenance of the status quo in the
B25 1330  2    world. The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans,
B25 1330 10    on the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is
B25 1340  9    strong enough to support them in the "just wars of
B25 1350  7    liberation" they would like to embark on before long:
B25 1360  4    with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans
B25 1370  1    and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of
B25 1370  9    their respective countries.
B25 1380  2       Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position
B25 1390  2    than any since 1957, when the "anti-party group" nearly
B25 1400  1    liquidated him. He seems strong enough inside the party
B25 1400 10    to cope with any internal opposition; but if he is
B25 1410  8    up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs,
B25 1420  5    he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice
B25 1430  2    in his life. He may support China (but he won't); he
B25 1440  1    may break with China (which would be infernally difficult
B25 1440 10    and perhaps disastrous), or he may succeed, by all
B25 1450  8    kinds of dangerous concessions, in persuading China
B25 1460  4    to be patient. The next days may show where things
B25 1470  1    stand. ON a misty Sunday morning last month, a small
B25 1480 10    band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen
B25 1490  6    held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles
B25 1500  4    east of here. Eleven men, a woman and a teen-age boy
B25 1510  2    tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during
B25 1510 10    a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla
B25 1520  8    warfare.
B25 1520  9       To the average American, this must sound like an
B25 1530  7    incredible tale from a Saturday night TV movie. But
B25 1540  5    to the Minutemen, this is a serious business. They
B25 1550  2    feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death
B25 1560  1    struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.
B25 1560  9    They feel that World War III has already begun, and
B25 1570  9    they are setting themselves up as a "last line of defense"
B25 1580  8    against the Communist advance.
B25 1590  1       Their national leader, Robert Bolivar DePugh of
B25 1590  8    Norborne, Mo., says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla
B25 1600  8    tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught.
B25 1610  7    In their maneuvers last month, they wore World War
B25 1620  5    II camouflage garb and helmets, and carried unloaded
B25 1630  1    M-1 rifles.
B25 1630  4       The maneuvers were held "in secret" after a regional
B25 1640  4    seminar for the Minutemen, held in nearby Shiloh, Ill.,
B25 1650  2    had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs,
B25 1650 12    who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of
B25 1660  7    Collinsville, Ill., and seized four operative weapons,
B25 1670  6    including a Browning machine gun, two Browning automatic
B25 1680  4    rifles and an M-4 rifle.
B25 1680 10       Undismayed by this contretemps, a small band of
B25 1690  8    the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6:30 A.M.
B25 1700  5    the next day, put on their uniforms, and headed for
B25 1710  4    a farm several miles away. A 60 mm. mortar and a 57
B25 1715  2    mm. recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought
B25 1720  8    along. The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and
B25 1730  7    the recoilless rifle was deactivated.
B25 1740  1       After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World
B25 1740 12    War II army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived
B25 1750 10    at a small clearing squeezed between a long, low ridge
B25 1760  7    and a creek-filled gully. Here the two leaders, DePugh
B25 1770  5    and Lauchli, hastened to put the group through its
B25 1780  3    paces.
B25 1780  4       The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain
B25 1790  3    for concealment. They were shown how to advance against
B25 1790 12    an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge. They practiced
B25 1800  9    movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades;
B25 1810  7    and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against
B25 1820  5    a camouflaged enemy encampment. Eleven dummy rounds
B25 1830  2    were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire
B25 1830 12    mortar shooting.
B25 1840  2       Mrs. DePugh, the mother of five children and an
B25 1850  1    active member of her husband's organization, participated
B25 1850  8    in all the exercises.
B25 1860  2       There were no "casualties", but the "guerrillas"
B25 1870  1    admitted to being "a little tired" when the leaders
B25 1870 10    called a halt at 9 A.M. to enable out-of-town members
B25 1880 12    to catch a plane.
