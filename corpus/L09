L09 0010  1    Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up. "Happened
L09 0010  8    to be in the hall! Happened to hear you quarrel about
L09 0020  8    her! Oh, well, you can't really blame Lolotte. She
L09 0030  5    lost her beau to you".
L09 0030 10       But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black
L09 0040 11    line of the open door; Sarah remembered it clearly.
L09 0050  5    Maude went on. "I've got to get busy. Miss Celie's
L09 0060  5    taken to her bed, with the door locked. She opened
L09 0070  2    it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you.
L09 0070 15    Here"- She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick
L09 0080 13    red cord into Sarah's hand. "Not that there's much
L09 0090  6    use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse
L09 0100  4    now. Drink your coffee"-
L09 0100  8       Coffee. "It's- cold". Maude suddenly looked quite
L09 0110  6    capable of pouring it down her throat. "I don't want
L09 0120  8    it", Sarah said, firmly.
L09 0130  1       "Oh. Well- I'll take it down with me as I go".
L09 0140  1       Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop
L09 0140 11    as if about to take off with a racing start. At the
L09 0150  8    door she turned back, her Roman nose looking very long
L09 0160  4    now and satiric. "I forgot. Ben and Lucien have gone
L09 0170  3    after them. It's just like that book your Northern
L09 0170 12    friend wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to
L09 0180  8    cross and no bloodhounds".
L09 0190  1       "I don't know Mrs. Stowe ... What can they do if
L09 0200  3    they find them"?
L09 0200  6       "They can't do anything. It's silly, childish, running
L09 0210  4    after them like that. I told Ben so. But of course
L09 0220  3    the paterollers won't be of any help, not with everything
L09 0230  1    so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is
L09 0230 11    running around, God knows where".
L09 0240  4       She had swished away, she had been gone for a long
L09 0250  3    time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she
L09 0250 11    ought to stop her, pour out the coffee, so no one would
L09 0260 11    drink it. But then the so-called coffee was bad enough
L09 0270  7    at best, cold it was all but undrinkable- especially
L09 0280  4    that cup!
L09 0280  6       She was deeply, horribly sure that Lucien had filled
L09 0290  5    it with opium. She had quarreled with Lucien, she had
L09 0300  3    resisted his demands for money- and if she died, by
L09 0300 13    the provisions of her marriage contract, Lucien would
L09 0310  7    inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold
L09 0320  7    under the floorboards in the office, but later, when
L09 0330  3    the war was over, her father's entire estate.
L09 0340  1       She felt cold and hot, sticky and chilly at the
L09 0340 10    same time. Now wait a minute, she told herself, think
L09 0350  6    about it; Lucien is not the only person in this house
L09 0360  4    who could have put opium in that coffee.
L09 0360 12       She had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on
L09 0370 11    the trip from New Orleans. Or someone had taken it
L09 0380  6    during her first day at Honotassa. Yes, she had missed
L09 0390  4    it after her talk with Emile, after dinner, just before
L09 0400  2    Emile was shot. Rilly or Glendora had entered her room
L09 0400 12    while she slept, bringing back her washed clothes.
L09 0410  8    So somebody else could have come in, too- then or later
L09 0420  8    while she was out of the room. It would have been easy
L09 0430  5    to identify as opium by its odor.
L09 0430 12       It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien
L09 0440  8    had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa
L09 0450  7    with a formed plan to murder her. He didn't even know
L09 0460  4    that she was there. And he certainly couldn't have
L09 0470  2    guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold
L09 0470 12    or that she was not the yielding- yes, and credible
L09 0480  8    fool he had every right to expect. No, he had been
L09 0490  6    surprised, unpleasantly surprised, but surprised.
L09 0500  1       Then somebody else? Don't question, Rev had said,
L09 0500  9    don't invite danger. Her skin crawled: Lolotte had
L09 0510  8    told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was
L09 0520 10    open. Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile, she
L09 0530  5    had begun to question and a little draft had crept
L09 0540  1    across the room from the bedroom door, open barely
L09 0540 10    enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall. So Lolotte-
L09 0550 10    or anybody- could have listened, and that somebody
L09 0560  5    could have already been supplied with the missing bottle
L09 0570  4    of opium.
L09 0570  6       That was not reasonable either. The opium had disappeared
L09 0580  5    before Emile's death and whoever shot him could not
L09 0590  3    by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah's
L09 0600  1    own doubts and suspicions- and questions.
L09 0600  7       She began to doubt whether there had been in fact
L09 0610  7    a lethal dose of opium in the cup. So suppose somebody
L09 0620  3    only wished to frighten her, so she would leave Honotassa!
L09 0630  1       That made a certain amount of logic. Added to the
L09 0640  1    argument was the fact that while she might have tasted
L09 0640 11    the coffee if it had been still hot, she might even
L09 0650  8    have drunk some of it, she wouldn't have taken enough
L09 0660  4    to kill her, for she would have been warned by its
L09 0670  2    taste.
L09 0670  3       No. It was merely an attempt to frighten her.
L09 0680  1       She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested;
L09 0680 11    she wouldn't run like a scared cat. But- well, she'd
L09 0690  9    be very careful.
L09 0700  1       She dressed and the accustomed routine restored
L09 0700  8    to her a sense of normal everyday life.
L09 0710  5       But before she left her room she dug into her big
L09 0720  4    moire bag, took out the envelope holding her marriage
L09 0720 13    contract and the wax seal had been broken. So somebody
L09 0730 10    else knew what would happen to her father's money if
L09 0740  8    she died.
L09 0740 10       Rev had known all along. Rev didn't need to break
L09 0750  8    the wax seal, read the contract and find out. He could
L09 0760  6    conceivably have wished to make sure; Rev loved Honotassa,
L09 0770  3    it was like a part of his breath and body; Rev had
L09 0780  2    stressed the need for money. Rev would never have tried
L09 0780 12    to give her poison!
L09 0790  2       She thrust the envelope back in the bag; there was
L09 0800  2    no point in locking it up in the armoire now, it was
L09 0800 14    like locking the barn after the horse was stolen. And
L09 0810  9    in all likelihood, by now, there was more than one
L09 0820  6    person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage
L09 0830  2    contract. There was no point either in telling herself
L09 0830 11    again what a fool she'd been.
L09 0840  6       She went downstairs and received another curious
L09 0850  2    shock, for when Glendora flapped into the dining room
L09 0850 11    in her homemade moccasins, Sarah asked her when she
L09 0860  9    had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she
L09 0870  8    hadn't. "Too much work this morning, Miss Sarah- everybody
L09 0880  4    gone like that"-
L09 0880  7       Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction
L09 0890  6    in her throat. "Well, then who brought it"?
L09 0900  4       "Miss Maude. She come to the kitchen and say she
L09 0910  4    take it up to you". Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm
L09 0920  1    rice. "Not much breakfast this morning. I don't know
L09 0920 10    what we're going to do, Miss Sarah".
L09 0930  6       "We've got to eat", Sarah said, curtly, because
L09 0940  5    a chill crawled over her again. Maude?
L09 0950  1       Glendora flapped away. The rice wasn't dosed with
L09 0950  9    opium, indeed it had no taste at all, not a grain of
L09 0960 12    salt. She ate what she could and went out along the
L09 0970  7    covered passageway, with the rain dripping from the
L09 0980  3    vines. In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking
L09 0990  1    chickens. "Get a basket", Sarah told her. "We'll go
L09 0990 10    to the storehouse".
L09 1000  2       Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers,
L09 1010  1    and went with her through the drizzle, to the storehouse.
L09 1010 11    Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door.
L09 1020  9       It was a long, low room, like a root cellar, for
L09 1030  8    it was banked up with soil, and vines had run rampant
L09 1040  4    over that, too. It was dark but dry and cool. She doled
L09 1050  2    out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts
L09 1050 11    of dried peas, eggs, cornmeal, a little salt. The shelves
L09 1060  9    looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the
L09 1070  8    storeroom, and since the men from the Commissary had
L09 1080  4    called; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed
L09 1090  3    but there was less to feed them with. She took Glendora
L09 1090 14    to the smokehouse, unlocked it and saw with satisfaction
L09 1100  9    there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon,
L09 1110  9    hanging from the smoke-stained rafters.
L09 1120  2       They wouldn't go hungry, not yet. And the fields
L09 1130  1    were green and growing. "Can't you possibly imagine
L09 1130  9    what life is going to be like, here"? Maude had said.
L09 1140  9       Maude.
L09 1141  1       She sent Glendora back to the house, her basket
L09 1150  9    and her apron laden. She stood for a moment, rain dripping
L09 1160  7    from the trees over her head, thinking of Maude.
L09 1170  3       Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of
L09 1180  2    opium from Sarah's room. Maude had the cool ruthlessness
L09 1180 11    to d o whatever she made up her mind to do. She couldn't
L09 1190 11    see how her death could affect Maude. She couldn't
L09 1200  6    see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten
L09 1210  4    her. Besides, there was something hysterical and silly,
L09 1220  2    something almost childish about an attempt to frighten
L09 1220 10    her. Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah
L09 1230  8    rather doubted if she had ever been childish.
L09 1240  3       Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New
L09 1250  2    York. Maude could have shot Emile- if she'd had a reason
L09 1260  1    to kill him.
L09 1260  4       There was no use in standing there in the drizzle,
L09 1270  1    trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium
L09 1270 11    in a cup of coffee.
L09 1280  3       She started back for the house, saw a light in the
L09 1290  1    office, opened the door and surprised a domestic little
L09 1290 10    scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder
L09 1300  8    or attempted murder. Rev, George and Lolotte were mending
L09 1310  5    shoes.
L09 1310  6       a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky, drizzling
L09 1320  5    day. They were all three bent over a shabby riding
L09 1330  2    boot; George had a tack hammer. Lolotte held a patch
L09 1330 12    of leather, Rev steadied something, a tiny brad, waiting
L09 1340  9    for George's poised hammer. George said, "First thing
L09 1350  7    I do when I get to Vicksburg again, is get me a Yankee"-
L09 1360  7       "With boots on", Lolotte laughed softly.
L09 1370  4       Rev looked up and saw her. Lolotte looked up and
L09 1380  4    stiffened. George didn't look up at all. There was
L09 1390  1    no way to know, no way to guess whether any one of
L09 1390 13    them was surprised at Sarah's appearance, believing
L09 1400  5    her to be drugged and senseless- and just possibly
L09 1410  4    dead.
L09 1410  5       Rev said, "Come in, Sarah. Reckon you know the news".
L09 1420  5       And what news, Sarah thought as satirically as Maude
L09 1430  3    might have said it.
L09 1430  7       Rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning.
L09 1440  6    He turned to George and Lolotte. "Take your cobbler's
L09 1450  3    shop somewhere else. I want to talk to Sarah".
L09 1460  1       Everything in the office, the spreading circle of
L09 1460  9    lamplight, the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands.
L09 1470  8    George poised with the tack hammer, the homely, everyday
L09 1480  6    atmosphere, all denied an attempt at murder. A rush
L09 1490  5    of panic caught Sarah. "No. Not now. I mean I've got
L09 1500  3    to- to see to the kitchen. Glendora"-
L09 1500 10       Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from
L09 1510  9    the office and from the question in Rev's face.
L09 1520  5       Now why did I do that? she thought as warm, drizzling
L09 1530  4    rain touched her face. She was no schoolgirl, refusing
L09 1540  2    to bear tales.
L09 1540  5       As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented
L09 1550  2    itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be
L09 1550 13    Lucien, her husband.
L09 1560  3       It might be, indeed it had already proved to be
L09 1570  3    a marriage without love, but it was marriage. So she
L09 1570 13    couldn't choose Rev as a confidant; it must be Lucien.
L09 1580 10       Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed
L09 1590  7    her coffee with opium, she thought, as coldly and sharply,
L09 1600  5    again, as Maude might have said it.
L09 1610  1       She paused at the kitchen door, caught her breath,
L09 1610 10    told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt
L09 1620  8    to frighten her and went into the kitchen, where Glendora
L09 1630  5    was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning
L09 1640  3    lamp chimneys. Glendora gave a gulp. "Miss Sarah, I
L09 1650  2    can't cut up no chicken. Miss Maude say she won't".
L09 1660  1       Again the homely, everyday details of daily living
L09 1660  8    refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her- or to murder
L09 1670  8    her.
L09 1670  9       The homely everyday details of living and domestic
L09 1680  6    requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate
L09 1690  4    urgency. No matter what had happened or hadn't happened,
L09 1700  1    somebody had to see about dinner. She eyed the chickens
L09 1700 11    with, if she had known it, something of Glendora's
L09 1710  7    dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the
L09 1720  6    time she had spent on Latin verbs.
