F05 0010  1       BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane
F05 0010  9    struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield
F05 0020  7    Gulf. Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked
F05 0030  8    the silver wings, but the engine roar was reassuring
F05 0040  4    to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He peered
F05 0050  2    ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into
F05 0050 11    view again below.
F05 0060  2       "Good old iron compass"! he thought.
F05 0060  8       A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive
F05 0070  9    which idled behind a string of gravel cars, and little
F05 0080  8    figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured
F05 0090  5    roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered Dog River
F05 0100  3    bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's
F05 0110  1    main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days
F05 0110 11    after the Great Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster
F05 0120  8    in the state's history- the little plane was its sole
F05 0130  9    replacement in carrying the United States mails.
F05 0150  3       Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for
F05 0160  2    three full days and it was still raining on the morning
F05 0160 13    of Friday, November 4, 1927, when officials of the
F05 0170  8    Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized
F05 0180  5    that their distribution system for Vermont had been
F05 0190  4    almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters
F05 0200  1    shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still
F05 0200 10    had offices- and wondered how to move the mail. The
F05 0210 11    state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges
F05 0220  6    and missing rights-of-way: it would obviously remain
F05 0230  3    out of commission for weeks. And once medicine, food,
F05 0240  2    clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's
F05 0240 11    victims, communications and the mail were the next
F05 0250  8    top problems.
F05 0250 10       From Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried
F05 0260  7    across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent,
F05 0270  7    N. Y. But what came in was piling up. The nearest
F05 0280  4    undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord,
F05 0290  1    N. H. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National
F05 0300  1    Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state,
F05 0300 13    it seemed a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's
F05 0310  7    bottleneck and that at Montpelier too.
F05 0320  4       The question was "Where to land"? There was no such
F05 0330  5    thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator
F05 0340  1    John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest
F05 0340  9    of Fort Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned
F05 0350  9    National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged
F05 0360  6    "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen
F05 0370  6    sod of the military base.
F05 0370 11       The only available field that could be used near
F05 0380  8    flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off
F05 0390  6    upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where takeoffs
F05 0400  2    and landings could be safely made only under light
F05 0400 11    wind conditions. Over in Barre the streets had been
F05 0410  8    deep in swirling water, and bridges were crumpled and
F05 0420  5    gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast
F05 0430  3    by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield
F05 0430 11    committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd
F05 0440 10    Infantry, Vermont National Guard, laid out runways
F05 0450  5    on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill. The "Barre
F05 0460  3    Aviation Field" was set to receive its first aircraft
F05 0470  2    the Sunday following the flood.
F05 0470  7       Though the makeshift airports were ready, the York
F05 0480  6    State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of
F05 0490  5    mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training
F05 0500  1    consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out
F05 0500 11    of established airports, And the increasingly cold
F05 0510  6    weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines
F05 0520  5    of their World War I planes. It seemed like a good
F05 0530  4    time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering
F05 0540  1    the post office department to contract for the transport
F05 0540 10    of first class mail by air. They had to act fast, for
F05 0550 11    letters were clogging the terminals.
F05 0560  2       Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier in the
F05 0570  3    right place at the right time: Robert S. Fogg, a native
F05 0580  1    New Englander, had been a World War I flying instructor,
F05 0580 11    barnstormer, and one of the original planners of the
F05 0590  9    Concord Airport. Tall, wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had
F05 0600  7    already racked up one historical first in air mail
F05 0610  5    history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy MF flying boat off
F05 0620  3    Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the
F05 0620 11    original Rural Delivery air service in America.
F05 0630  7       During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight
F05 0640  4    to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil aviators overnight
F05 0650  3    became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob Fogg was the
F05 0670  3    most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited
F05 0680  1    backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at
F05 0680 11    putting their city and state on the flying map. The
F05 0690  9    ship was a Waco biplane, one of the first two of its
F05 0700  7    type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225HP Wright
F05 0710  2    radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green
F05 0710 11    and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the
F05 0720  8    Waco was entered to compete in the "On-to-Spokane"
F05 0730  7    Air Derby of 1927. As a matter of fact, Fogg and his
F05 0740  6    plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race- an
F05 0750  2    engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service
F05 0760  1    and school he started subsequently were first steps
F05 0760  9    in paying off his wry-faced backers. So with all this
F05 0770  8    experience, Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive
F05 0780  4    the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract. His
F05 0790  2    work began just six days after the flood.
F05 0790 10       By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance
F05 0800  8    of about 150 miles, counting a slight deviation for
F05 0810  5    the stop at either Barre or Montpelier. The first few
F05 0820  4    days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back
F05 0830  1    of the State House when the wind was right, and used
F05 0830 12    Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't. Between the
F05 0840  8    unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road
F05 0850  5    haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat,
F05 0860  3    arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.
F05 0870  1    Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck,
F05 0870 10    begged the postal officials that met him to find a
F05 0880  8    safer landing place, preferably on the flat-topped
F05 0890  5    hills across the Winooski River.
F05 0890 10       "But Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there.
F05 0900  9    And besides you seem to make it all right here". It
F05 0910  9    took a tragedy to bring things to a head. After a week
F05 0920  7    of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs,
F05 0930  2    Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage
F05 0940  1    of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field.
F05 0940 11    Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red
F05 0950  7    Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed, and his
F05 0960  7    pilot, Lt. Franklin Wolfe, badly injured. With the
F05 0970  4    field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply
F05 0980  1    flown into the hillside.
F05 0980  5       Faced with this situation, Postmaster Charles F.
F05 0990  3    McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington
F05 1000  1    trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the
F05 1000 10    heights of Berlin. A long flat known as the St. John
F05 1010 11    field seemed to answer their purpose, and since the
F05 1020  6    Winooski bridges were at last passable, they decided
F05 1030  3    to use it.
F05 1030  6       With a wary eye on the farmer's bull, Fred Somers
F05 1040  4    of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with
F05 1050  3    a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they
F05 1050 13    tied a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and
F05 1060 11    a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco,
F05 1070  6    Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part
F05 1080  5    of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21, 1927.
F05 1090  2       Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with
F05 1090 11    mail pouches. During the second week of operations,
F05 1100  8    Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department,
F05 1110  6    asking him to "put on two airplanes and make two flights
F05 1120  5    daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since Fogg's was a one-man,
F05 1130  6    one-plane flying service, this meant that he would
F05 1140  2    have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day,
F05 1140 13    under sub-freezing temperature conditions.
F05 1150  3       Over the weeks, America's first Star Route Air Mail
F05 1160  6    settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries
F05 1170  2    of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids
F05 1170 12    to navigation. Each morning at five Fogg crawled out
F05 1180  8    of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace
F05 1190  6    register of his home. Always troubled by poor circulation
F05 1200  4    in his feet, he experimented with various combinations
F05 1210  1    of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style
F05 1210 10    felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots
F05 1220  7    pulled over them. A sheep-lined leather flying suit,
F05 1230  4    plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed his attire
F05 1240  3    for the rigors of the open cockpit. The airman's stock
F05 1240 13    answer to "Weren't you cold"? became "Yes, the first
F05 1250  9    half hour is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't
F05 1260 11    notice it"!
F05 1270  1       As daylight began to show through the frosty windows,
F05 1270 10    Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U.
F05 1280 11    S. Weather Station at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature
F05 1290  6    and wind-velocity readings. Shaw could also give the
F05 1300  6    flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual
F05 1310  4    check of the mountains to be seen from his station.
F05 1320  1    "Ceilings" were judged by comparison with known mountain
F05 1320  9    heights and cloud positions. Later on in the day Fogg
F05 1330 10    could get a better weather picture from the Burlington
F05 1340  5    Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell.
F05 1350  3       Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's skilled
F05 1360  2    mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up
F05 1360 11    and running in the drafty hangar. (He'd get the engine
F05 1370  9    oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas
F05 1380  7    cover.) Wishing to show that aviation was dependable
F05 1390  3    and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point of taking
F05 1400  3    off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding
F05 1400 12    rain, snow and sleet in true postal tradition. Concord
F05 1410  8    learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the
F05 1420  7    Whirlwind's exhaust overhead. Sometimes the pilot had
F05 1430  4    to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his
F05 1440  1    trips were completed.
F05 1440  4       Plane radios were not yet available, and once in
F05 1450  4    the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory
F05 1450 15    for landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for
F05 1460 10    dead reckoning and quick computation. Often, threading
F05 1470  4    through the overcast, he was forced to fly close to
F05 1480  5    the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski
F05 1490  1    or the White River along the line of the broken railroad.
F05 1490 12    When driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg
F05 1500 10    would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try
F05 1510  8    another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville
F05 1520  4    in search of safe passage through the mountain passes.
F05 1530  2       The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on
F05 1540  1    these trips. It ticked over smoothly, idling while
F05 1540  9    Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from
F05 1550  7    Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen, and one from Montpelier
F05 1560  5    and Barre at the St. John field.
F05 1570  1       Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would "go
F05 1570 10    upstairs" high over the clouds. There he'd take a compass
F05 1580  9    heading, figure his air speed, and deduce that in a
F05 1590  8    certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows
F05 1600  4    of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let
F05 1610  3    down through the overcast and see the ground before
F05 1610 12    it hit him. Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages
F05 1620  7    of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems.
F05 1630  6    At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco
F05 1640  6    down through the cloud bank and hope to break through
F05 1650  2    where some feature of the winter landscape would be
F05 1650 11    recognizable.
F05 1660  1       Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just
F05 1660 10    time to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab
F05 1670  9    a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the
F05 1680  6    second trip. Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth
F05 1690  4    on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers in
F05 1700  2    their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to
F05 1700 11    recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest
F05 1710  9    of the country.
F05 1710 12       The flyer had his share of near-misses. At Fort
F05 1720 10    Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain
F05 1730  5    could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane
F05 1740  4    if the pilot miscalculated. Once the soldiers from
F05 1750  1    the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away
F05 1750 11    while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up. At
F05 1760  9    a nod of his head they let go, turning to cup their
F05 1770  5    ears against the icy slipstream. Tracks in the snow
F05 1780  2    showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred
F05 1780 12    feet.
F05 1790  1       One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm,
F05 1790  8    Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field.
