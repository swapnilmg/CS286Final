P24 0010  1    There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the
P24 0010 13    sun was hot. The new Riverside pitcher turned out to
P24 0020  7    have an overhand fast ball that took a hop. For a few
P24 0030  7    innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out.
P24 0040  2    Then, in the fifth, Anniston's kid catcher caught onto
P24 0040 11    a curve and smacked the ball into left center field.
P24 0050  9    @ Eddie Lee, Riverside's redheaded playing manager,
P24 0060  4    ran after the ball but it rolled past him. Phil Rossoff
P24 0070  5    cut over to center from left field to get the relay.
P24 0080  2    Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw
P24 0080 13    it to Phil. @ "Third! Third base"! Eddie shouted. @
P24 0090  9    Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike
P24 0100 10    Deegan's hands on third base. Mike caught the ball
P24 0110  7    just as the catcher slid into the bag. But the Anniston
P24 0120  4    boy had begun his slide too late. He came into the
P24 0130  2    bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball
P24 0130 12    down full in his face. @ "You bastard"! the Anniston
P24 0150  5    catcher screamed. He jumped to his feet and started
P24 0160  7    to throw punches. Mike Deegan tossed his glove away
P24 0170  4    and began to swing at the catcher. This brought in
P24 0170 14    everybody from both sides, while the spectators stood
P24 0180  8    up and added to the uproar. @ The fighters were separated
P24 0190  7    in a few minutes. The game was resumed. But Mike Deegan
P24 0200  6    was boiling mad now. When the inning was over he cursed
P24 0210  5    the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout. @
P24 0220  2    Phil Rossoff, coming in from left field, stopped at
P24 0220 11    the water fountain for a drink. Mike Deegan was standing
P24 0230  9    beside it, facing the field. He was eyeing the Anniston
P24 0240  7    catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began.
P24 0250  4    @ "Keep your eyes open, sonny"! Mike yelled to the
P24 0260  4    catcher. "You're in for trouble". @ The Anniston catcher
P24 0280  2    did not reply with words. He simply turned to Mike
P24 0280 12    and smiled. This so infuriated Deegan that he spun
P24 0290  8    around and said: "I'll get that little bastard. So
P24 0300  6    help me God, I'll get him".
P24 0310  1       Phil Rossoff said: "Why don't you leave him alone"?
P24 0320  1       "Mind your own goddamn business", Mike Deegan said.
P24 0320  9       Phil shrugged. He stepped into the dugout, wondering
P24 0330  9    why Deegan was always looking for trouble. Maybe the
P24 0340  8    answer was in his eyes. When Deegan smiled his eyes
P24 0350  5    never fit in with his lips.
P24 0350 11       In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got
P24 0360  9    up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's
P24 0370  6    head. By the time the fielder got his hands on the
P24 0380  4    ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for
P24 0380 13    home. The left fielder threw and it was a good one.
P24 0390 11    But Mike had no chance of being tagged. The Anniston
P24 0400  6    catcher was straddling home plate. All Deegan had to
P24 0410  5    do was slide, fall away, but instead, he rammed into
P24 0420  1    the catcher.
P24 0420  3       Both fell heavily to the ground.
P24 0420  9       Only Mike got to his feet. He went back to touch
P24 0430 11    home plate, turned and walked to the dugout without
P24 0440  6    looking back.
P24 0440  8       The Anniston players and their manager ran out on
P24 0450  7    the field. They poured water over their catcher's face.
P24 0460  3    He did not move. Then the manager called for a doctor.
P24 0470  2    The Riverside physician came down to look over the
P24 0470 11    injured ballplayer. Then, quickly, and a little nervously,
P24 0480  8    the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry
P24 0490  7    the catcher into the dressing room.
P24 0500  1       Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench, watching.
P24 0500  9    When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off
P24 0510  7    the field he said: "That ought to teach the sonofabitch".
P24 0520  6       Phil Rossoff, seated next to Deegan, got up and
P24 0530  6    moved to the other end of the bench.
P24 0540  1       The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside
P24 0540  9    dugout. He was followed by four of his men. It began
P24 0550  9    to look as if something was going to happen. Mike sat
P24 0560  5    quitely watching the manager come nearer. Eddie Lee
P24 0570  2    moved over to Mike Deegan's side. No one said a word.
P24 0570 13       The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout
P24 0580 10    in front of Mike. His face was flushed.
P24 0590  5       "Deegan", the manager said, his voice pitched low,
P24 0600  4    quivering. "That was a rotten thing to do".
P24 0610  1       "For God's sake", Mike said, waving the manager
P24 0610  9    away. "Stop it, will you? Tell your guys not to block
P24 0620 11    the plate".
P24 0630  1       "You didn't have to ram him".
P24 0630  7       "That's what you say".
P24 0640  2       The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee. It was
P24 0650  2    a cold and calculated look. He turned and went back
P24 0650 12    across the field to his dugout. He called in the pitcher
P24 0660  9    who had been pitching, and a big, heavy, powerfully
P24 0670  5    built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston.
P24 0680  3       The game started again and in the eighth inning
P24 0690  1    Mike Deegan came up to bat. Everyone in the ball park
P24 0690 12    seemed to be standing and shouting.
P24 0700  4       The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for
P24 0710  4    Mike's head. Deegan fell into the dirt, the ball going
P24 0720  1    over him. He arose slowly and brushed himself off.
P24 0720 10    He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch
P24 0730 10    dropped into the dirt again.
P24 0740  1       "Hit the bum"! somebody yelled from the Anniston
P24 0750  1    bench.
P24 0750  2       In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco, shortstop,
P24 0750  9    whispered into Phil's ear: "There's gonna be a fight".
P24 0770  1       "Look at those bastards"! Charlie Haydon, a pitcher,
P24 0770  9    said. "They're looking for trouble".
P24 0780  5       Mike was slow getting into the box this time. When
P24 0790  6    he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away
P24 0800  2    as the pitch came in.
P24 0800  7       "Listen"! he shouted to the pitcher. "One more and
P24 0810  6    I'm coming out there"!
P24 0820  1       "I'll be waiting"! the pitcher yelled back.
P24 0820  7       Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end
P24 0830  8    of his bat. He stood flat-footed in the box, but not
P24 0840  6    very close to the plate now. The pitcher wound up and
P24 0850  3    the ball came in straight for Mike's head. Deegan dropped,
P24 0860  1    got up, turned and, holding the bat with both hands
P24 0860 11    up against his chest, began to walk slowly out to the
P24 0870  9    mound. The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards
P24 0880  6    Mike Deegan. They were both walking towards each other,
P24 0890  3    unhurried.
P24 0890  4       Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the
P24 0900  4    field. In the next moment, it seemed, the infield was
P24 0910  1    crowded with spectators, ballplayers, cops, kids and
P24 0910  8    a dog. There was much shouting and screaming. Fights
P24 0920  6    sprang up and were quickly squelched. Mike and the
P24 0930  4    Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even
P24 0940  1    came together.
P24 0940  3       Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did
P24 0950  2    not go out on the field when the fighting started.
P24 0950 12       After the game, Phil was taking off his sweatshirt
P24 0960  9    in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in.
P24 0970  5       "It's a helluva thing", Mike said, looking at Phil,
P24 0980  5    "when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help
P24 0990  4    him in a fight".
P24 0990  8       Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his
P24 1000  4    head. Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil.
P24 1010  2    The other players were undressing quietly. Eddie Lee
P24 1010 10    had not come in yet.
P24 1020  4       Mike went over to Phil and stood over him. "Why
P24 1030  1    the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang
P24 1030 12    up on me"?
P24 1040  1       "I didn't think it was necessary".
P24 1040  7       "Well! Now that's just fine! You didn't think it
P24 1050  9    was necessary". Mike placed both his hands on his hips.
P24 1060  8    He pushed his jaw forward. "Listen, wise guy, if you
P24 1070  5    think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club
P24 1080  5    you're crazy".
P24 1080  7       Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had
P24 1090  6    to look up into Mike's face.
P24 1100  1       "I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club", Phil
P24 1100 11    said slowly. "Nobody else did, either".
P24 1110  5       "You trying to say I started the fight"?
P24 1120  3       "I'm not trying to say anything".
P24 1130  1       Phil turned away and opened his locker, and then
P24 1130 10    he heard Mike Deegan say: "You're yellow, Rossoff"!
P24 1140  6    and Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around.
P24 1150  8    But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was
P24 1160  4    between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing
P24 1170  2    room.
P24 1170  3       "Phil, come into my office", Eddie said.
P24 1180  1       Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the
P24 1180 10    door. He sat down before Eddie's desk.
P24 1190  5       "I'm doing you a favor", Eddie said quickly. "You
P24 1200  5    get your unconditional release as of today".
P24 1210  1       Phil's eyes widened just a trifle.
P24 1210  7       "The best thing for you to do", Eddie said, "is
P24 1220  9    go home. You don't belong in professional baseball".
P24 1230  4       Phil had to clear his throat. "Is this because of
P24 1240  5    what happened out there"?
P24 1240  9       "No", Eddie said. "But it does confirm what I've
P24 1250  9    suspected all along".
P24 1260  1       Phil stood up. "Listen! This is the second time
P24 1270  1    ..."
P24 1270  2       "Sit down, sit down", Eddie said. "I'm not saying
P24 1280  1    you're yellow. I am saying you're not a professional
P24 1280 10    ballplayer".
P24 1290  1       Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk. "Now listen
P24 1300  1    to me, Phil. I'm not steering you wrong. You haven't
P24 1300 11    got the heart for baseball".
P24 1310  5       Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned. Suddenly
P24 1320  2    his voice grew hard. "What the hell do you think baseball
P24 1330  1    is? You're not in the big leagues, but if you can't
P24 1330 12    give and take down here what the hell do you think
P24 1340 11    it'll be like up there"?
P24 1350  1       Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him
P24 1350 10    short. "Now don't tell me what a good ball player you
P24 1360 11    are. I know you've got talent. But what you haven't
P24 1370  7    got is the heart to back up that talent with. The heart,
P24 1380  6    Phil. You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball,
P24 1390  4    and that's it".
P24 1390  7       Dazed, Phil said: "I don't get it. My batting average
P24 1400  7    ..."
P24 1400  8       Eddie stood up abruptly, then sat down just as abruptly.
P24 1410  7    "What difference does your batting average make? Or
P24 1420  5    your fielding average. Or even the way you run bases.
P24 1430  3    I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to
P24 1430 14    win- you won't do it. That's what I mean by no heart
P24 1440 14    for the game. Baseball's no cinch. Deegan had no business
P24 1450  9    ramming into that kid out there. He did it because
P24 1460  8    he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's
P24 1470  4    one less who might take his job away later on. What
P24 1480  2    the hell do you think baseball is? A sport? It's a
P24 1480 13    way of life, goddamit! And you've got to be ready to
P24 1500  5    cut to ribbons anybody who want to take your way of
P24 1510  8    life away from you"!
P24 1510 12       He's wrong! Phil thought. It's only his opinion.
P24 1520  8    There were other clubs in this league. He stood up
P24 1530  9    slowly. He was a little pale and shaky. His lips felt
P24 1540  6    glued together.
P24 1540  8       "I think you're wrong, Eddie", he said finally.
P24 1550  6       Eddie nodded. "Okay. You'll get your pay in the
P24 1560  6    morning".
P24 1560  7       Phil turned and left the room, hearing Eddie say:
P24 1570  6    "Someday you'll see I was right".
P24 1580  1       Phil shut the door behind him. Outside in the dressing
P24 1580 11    room, Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his
P24 1595  9    street clothes.
P24 1600  1       "What happened"? Frankie asked.
P24 1600  5       Phil said: "I got my release".
P24 1610  4       "You crazy"?
P24 1610  6       Phil shrugged.
P24 1620  1       "What for"?
P24 1620  3       Phil sighed.
P24 1620  5       Frankie shook his head. "I don't get it".
P24 1630  6       "I don't know", Phil said.
P24 1640  2       They were silent for a few moments. Then Frankie
P24 1640 11    said: "What are you gonna do"?
P24 1650  6       Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie
P24 1660  4    sat down on the bench again. Phil took off one shoe
P24 1670  2    and stared at it.
P24 1670  6       "Don't take it like this", Frankie said. "Hell,
P24 1680  3    plenty of guys get let out and come back later. The
P24 1690  1    leagues are full of guys like that".
P24 1690  8       Phil was very quiet.
P24 1700  1       "What are you gonna do, Phil"?
P24 1700  7       Phil did not answer.
P24 1710  1       "Why not try another club"?
P24 1710  6       Phil looked up. What the hell right did Eddie have
P24 1720  8    saying a thing like that?
P24 1730  1       "Springfield's in tomorrow", Frankie said. "Talk
P24 1730  7    to Whitey Jackson".
P24 1740  2       He just didn't know what he was talking about, saying
P24 1750  2    a thing like that.
P24 1750  6       "Will you do it, Phil"?
P24 1760  1       "Do what"?
P24 1760  3       "Ask Whitey for a job".
P24 1770  1       Phil nodded. "Sure", he said. "Springfield come
P24 1770  7    in tomorrow"?
P24 1780  1       Frankie nodded.
P24 1780  3       "I'll speak to Whitey".
P24 1790  1       "Atta boy".
P24 1790  3       "I'll talk to him, all right".
P24 1800  1       "Don't worry", Frankie said. "You'll get a job there.
P24 1810  1    He needs outfielders bad".
P24 1810  5       "I'm not worried about it", Phil said.
P24 1820  3       "That's the way to talk. What else did Eddie have
P24 1830  2    to say"?
P24 1830  4       "Nothing", Phil said.
