D15 0010  1       Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal
D15 0010  8    power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits;
D15 0020  8    they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer,
D15 0030  5    even more terrible abilities. Their direct descendants
D15 0040  3    inherited not only their worldly fortunes, but also
D15 0050  1    the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the
D15 0050 11    other half of the universe. Royal lineages could be
D15 0060  7    based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated
D15 0070  3    into eternal otherworldly power.
D15 0070  7       Thus, the emperor could draw on sources not available
D15 0080  9    to those with less puissant ancestors. But this eminence
D15 0090  6    was not without its weighty responsibilities. Since
D15 0100  2    he possessed more power in an interdependent universe
D15 0110  1    of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had
D15 0110 10    to use it for the benefit of the living. The royal
D15 0120  8    ritual generated power into the other world: it also
D15 0130  5    provided the living with a way to control the spirits,
D15 0140  2    and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday
D15 0140 12    affairs of the world. Proper ritual observance at any
D15 0150  9    level of society was capable of generating power for
D15 0160  6    use in the spirit world; but naturally, the royal ritual,
D15 0170  4    which provided unusual control over already supremely
D15 0180  1    powerful divine spirits, was held responsible for regulating
D15 0180  9    the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.
D15 0190  9       This is the familiar system of "cosmic government".
D15 0200  6    The Chinese emperor, by proper observance of ritual,
D15 0210  5    manifested divine powers. He regulated the dualities
D15 0220  3    of light and darkness, Yang and Yin, which are locked
D15 0230  2    in eternal struggle. By swaying the balance between
D15 0230 10    them, he effected the alternation of the seasons. His
D15 0240  8    power was so great that he even promoted and demoted
D15 0250  6    gods according to whether they had given ear or been
D15 0260  4    deaf to petitions.
D15 0260  7       In this system, no man is exempt from obligations.
D15 0270  3    Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's
D15 0280  1    family, outrages to community propriety, any departure
D15 0280  8    from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses
D15 0290  7    against the dead. And to offend the dead meant to incur
D15 0300  7    their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide
D15 0310  3    disasters. The family home was, in fact, a temple;
D15 0320  1    and the daily duties of individuals were basically
D15 0320  9    religious in nature. The dead spirits occupied a prominent
D15 0330  8    place in every hope and in every fear.
D15 0340  4       The common belief was that there existed one moral
D15 0350  2    order, which included everything. The dead controlled
D15 0350  9    the material prosperity of the living, and the living
D15 0360  8    adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to
D15 0370  6    weaken that control. Men believed they could control
D15 0380  2    nature by obeying a moral code. If the moral code were
D15 0380 13    flouted, the proper balance of the universe would be
D15 0390  9    upset, and the disastrous result could be floods, plague,
D15 0400  6    or famine.
D15 0400  8       Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending
D15 0410  4    this fusion of moral and material, largely because
D15 0420  3    in the West the historical trend has been to deny the
D15 0430  1    connection. Living in urban conditions, away from the
D15 0430  9    deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions
D15 0440  6    of a thatched-roof world view, the individual may find
D15 0450  5    it possible, say, to commit adultery not only without
D15 0460  2    personal misgivings, but also without suffering any
D15 0460  9    adverse effects in his worldly fortunes. Basing action
D15 0470  8    on the empirical determination of cause and effect
D15 0480  5    provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly
D15 0490  3    ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation
D15 0500  1    from the constraint of silent burial urns.
D15 0500  8       In China, the magical system par excellence was
D15 0510  7    Taoism. The Taoists were Quietist mystics, who saw
D15 0520  4    an unchanging unity- the Tao- underlying all phenomena.
D15 0530  3    It was this timeless unity that was all-important,
D15 0530 12    and not its temporary manifestations in the world of
D15 0540  9    reality. The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced
D15 0550  7    by proper magical manipulation; in other words, they
D15 0560  5    were actually an organization of magicians.
D15 0570  1       Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing
D15 0570  9    magical concepts. After this form of Indian Buddhism
D15 0580  8    had been introduced into China, it underwent extensive
D15 0590  6    changes. During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth
D15 0600  6    centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package
D15 0610  1    to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly
D15 0610 11    digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern
D15 0620  8    Western reader. Mahayana had gods, and magic, a pantheon,
D15 0630  7    heavens and hells, and gorgeously appareled priests,
D15 0640  3    monks, and nuns, all of whom wielded power over souls
D15 0650  2    in the other world. The self-realized Mahayana saint
D15 0650 11    possessed superhuman powers and magic. The Mahayana
D15 0660  7    that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry
D15 0670  7    and coarse magic, that made the world into a huge magical
D15 0680  5    garden. In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely an
D15 0690  2    organization of magic-practicing monks (bonzes), who
D15 0690  9    catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.
D15 0700  8       Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular, rational
D15 0710  5    philosophy, but even with this different orientation
D15 0720  2    it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.
D15 0730  1    Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue
D15 0730 11    had power. If a man lived a classical life, he need
D15 0740 10    not fear the spirits- for only lack of virtue gave
D15 0750  6    the spirits power over him. But let us not be mistaken
D15 0760  2    about Confucian "virtue"; this was not virtue as we
D15 0770  1    understand the word today, and it did not mean an abandonment
D15 0770 12    of the belief in magic manipulation. To the Confucian,
D15 0780  7    "virtue" simply meant mastery and correct observance
D15 0790  5    of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand
D15 0800  4    minor ones. Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance,
D15 0810  2    the mark of a true gentleman. To live correctly in
D15 0810 12    an interdependent moral and material universe of living
D15 0820  8    and dead was decisive for man's fate.
D15 0830  4       This, in brief, was the historical background out
D15 0840  2    of which Zen emerged. Promoters of Zen to the West
D15 0840 12    record its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out
D15 0850  9    of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism.
D15 0860  6    But the "marvelous person" that is supposed to result
D15 0870  6    from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian
D15 0880  3    speculation- he possesses magical powers, and can use
D15 0890  2    them to order nature and to redeem souls. Proponents
D15 0890 11    of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the
D15 0900  6    amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen, probably in order
D15 0910  6    to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with
D15 0920  3    more respectable Buddhist metaphysic. But in the Chinese
D15 0930  1    mind, there was little difference between the two-
D15 0930  9    the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician
D15 0940  8    has to be.
D15 0940 11       Actually, Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than
D15 0950  8    it does to Mahayana Buddhism. The Ch'an (Zen) sect
D15 0960  5    may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana, but
D15 0970  3    its psychology was pure early Taoist. This is well
D15 0975  1    evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in
D15 0980  8    Zen: the idea of the inward turning of thought, the
D15 0990  7    enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so
D15 1000  3    that a return to purity, peace, and stillness- a union
D15 1010  2    with the Infinite, with the Tao- could be effected.
D15 1010 11    In fact, the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed
D15 1020  7    by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of
D15 1030  4    the "direct thinking" Zennist was a feature of Taoism.
D15 1040  3    So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the
D15 1050  1    external world, and the ideas that language and things
D15 1050 10    perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed
D15 1060  6    for immediate perception by pure, indwelling spirit:
D15 1070  4    the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating
D15 1080  1    consciousness.
D15 1080  2       Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the
D15 1090  4    surface of experience. One of its features attractive
D15 1100  1    to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma
D15 1100 11    and for sacred texts. One patriarch is supposed to
D15 1110  7    have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse.
D15 1120  6    But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom
D15 1130  1    of action for which the Westerner mistakes it. It is
D15 1130 11    simply that in Taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms-
D15 1140  9    books, words, or any other manifestations that belong
D15 1150  7    to the normal state of consciousness are considered
D15 1160  3    only the surface of experience. The truth- the Eternal
D15 1170  2    Truth- is not transmittable by words. Reality is considered
D15 1180  1    not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge,
D15 1180 10    but a positive handicap. The technique of reality confusion-
D15 1190  9    the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's
D15 1200  8    grip on reality- originated with fourth and third century
D15 1210  6    B.C. Chinese Quietism: the koan is not basically a
D15 1230  6    new device.
D15 1230  8       It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize
D15 1240  6    that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few
D15 1250  4    cannot be the doctrine of the common man. In the supernatural
D15 1260  1    atmosphere of cosmic government, only the ruling elite
D15 1260  9    was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of
D15 1270  8    nature: popular religion aimed at more personal benefits
D15 1280  6    from magical powers. And this is only natural- witness
D15 1290  2    the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest
D15 1300  1    "wonder drug". Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically
D15 1300  8    aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine,
D15 1310  9    personal salvation being achieved when the mystical
D15 1320  5    recluse united with divine essence. But this esoteric
D15 1330  3    doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special
D15 1330 12    powers. The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically
D15 1340  8    influence the world of spirits in the same way that
D15 1350  8    the divine emperor manifested his power. Thus, the
D15 1360  3    Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation
D15 1360 10    was distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for
D15 1370 10    this reason, the mystic in Asia did not long remain
D15 1380  7    in isolated contemplation. As the Zen literature reveals,
D15 1390  3    as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion,
D15 1400  2    he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.
D15 1410  1    The early anchorite masters attracted disciples because
D15 1410  8    of their presumed ability to perform miracles.
D15 1420  5       Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen
D15 1430  5    doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China,
D15 1440  3    and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous
D15 1440 11    view of the universe. In support of this, stories from
D15 1450  9    the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks
D15 1460  7    the idea of supernatural power. But actually these
D15 1470  3    accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters
D15 1480  1    were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme
D15 1480 12    degree of popular credulity: "Hwang Pah (O baku), one
D15 1490  8    day going up Mount Tien Tai ... which was believed
D15 1500  7    to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural
D15 1510  3    powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange
D15 1510 12    light. They went along the pass talking with each other
D15 1520 10    for a short while until they came to a river roaring
D15 1530  8    with torrent. There being no bridge, the master had
D15 1540  4    to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed the
D15 1550  2    river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah
D15 1550 12    to follow him. Thereupon Hwang Pah said: "If I knew
D15 1560  9    thou art an Arhat, I would have doubled you up before
D15 1570  8    thou got over there"! The monk then understood the
D15 1580  4    spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah, and praised him
D15 1590  2    as a true Mahayanist. (1)"
D15 1590  7       A second tale shows still more clearly the kind
D15 1610  5    of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess: "On
D15 1620  2    one occasion Yang Shan (Kyo-zan) saw a stranger monk
D15 1620 12    flying through the air. When that monk came down and
D15 1630 10    approached him with a respectful salutation, he asked:
D15 1640  5    "Where art thou from"? "Early this morning", replied
D15 1650  4    the other, "I set out from India". "Why", said the
D15 1660  4    teacher, "art thou so late"? "I stopped", responded
D15 1670  2    the man, "several times to look at beautiful sceneries".
D15 1680  1    "Thou mayst have supernatural powers", exclaimed Yang
D15 1680  8    Shan, "yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha
D15 1690 10    to me". Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying: "I
D15 1700  8    have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri,
D15 1710  6    and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya", and after
D15 1720  3    giving the master some palm leaves he brought from
D15 1720 12    India, went back through the air. (2)"
D15 1730  7       In the popular Chinese mind, Ch'an (Zen) was no
D15 1740  6    exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated.
D15 1750  2       A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical
D15 1760  1    carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes.
D15 1760 10    To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with
D15 1770  9    "spiritual beings" who have to be appeased. Part of
D15 1780  8    the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings
D15 1790  3    of rice to the spiritual beings". Modern Zen presentation
D15 1800  1    to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly
D15 1800 10    pragmatic nature of the Zen belief- scriptures are
D15 1810  8    burned to make fire, action is based on direct self-confidence,
D15 1820  8    and so on. This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation
D15 1830  6    is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas
D15 1840  3    as: "O you, demons and other spiritual beings, I now
D15 1850  3    offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten
D15 1850 15    quarters of the world and all the demons and other
D15 1860 10    spiritual beings be fed therewith. (3)"
