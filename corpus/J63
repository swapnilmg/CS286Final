J63 0010  2    The Sane Society is an ambitious work. Its scope is
J63 0010 12    as broad as the question: What does it mean to live
J63 0020 11    in modern society? A work so broad, even when it is
J63 0030  9    directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral
J63 0040  4    vision, must necessarily "fail". Even a hasty reader
J63 0050  1    will easily find in it numerous blind spots, errors
J63 0050 10    of fact and argument, important exclusions, areas of
J63 0060  6    ignorance and prejudice, undue emphases on trivia,
J63 0070  4    examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence,
J63 0080  2    and the like. Such books are easy prey for critics.
J63 0080 12    Nor need the critic be captious. a careful and orderly
J63 0090  9    man, who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual
J63 0100  7    responsibility, might easily be put off by such a book.
J63 0110  7    It is a simple matter, for one so disposed, to take
J63 0120  2    a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds
J63 0120 13    and ends. The thing can be made to look like the cluttered
J63 0130 12    attic of a large and vigorous family- a motley jumble
J63 0140  7    of discarded objects, some outworn and some that were
J63 0150  5    never useful, some once whole and bright but now chipped
J63 0160  3    and tarnished, some odd pieces whose history no one
J63 0160 12    remembers, here and there a gem, everything fascinating
J63 0170  8    because it suggests some part of the human condition-
J63 0180  7    the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse
J63 0190  4    into the disorderly history of the makers and users.
J63 0200  1       That could be easily done, but there is little reason
J63 0200 11    in it. It would come down to saying that Fromm paints
J63 0210 10    with a broad brush, and that, after all, is not a conclusion
J63 0230  8    one must work toward but an impression he has from
J63 0240  4    the outset. I mention these features of the book because
J63 0250  2    they are inherent in the book's character and therefore
J63 0250 11    must be mentioned. It would be superfluous to build
J63 0260  9    a critique around them. There are more substantial
J63 0270  5    criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist
J63 0280  3    civilization.
J63 0280  4       It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment
J63 0290  3    has both descriptive and normative aspects. Since I
J63 0300  2    have already discussed his moral position, that discussion
J63 0300 10    is incorporated by reference into the following pages,
J63 0310  8    which will focus on the empirical and analytic side
J63 0320  7    of Fromm's treatment. I shall first indicate a couple
J63 0330  5    of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis, then argue that,
J63 0340  2    granted these weaknesses, he still has much left that
J63 0340 11    is valuable, and, finally, raise the general question
J63 0350  7    of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to
J63 0360  5    the question of alienation.
J63 0360  9       Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem
J63 0370 10    of alienation. Despite its rather long intellectual
J63 0380  5    history, alienation is still a promising hypothesis
J63 0390  2    and not a verified theory. The idea has received much
J63 0400  1    attention in philosophy, in literature, and in a few
J63 0400 10    works of general social criticism, such as The Sane
J63 0410  7    Society. What is missing is work that would answer,
J63 0420  5    presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type
J63 0430  1    attitude scales, such questions as these: What are
J63 0430  9    the components of the feeling-state described as alienation?
J63 0450  8    How widespread is alienation? What is its incidence
J63 0460  7    among the various classes and subgroups of the population?
J63 0470  6    Taking alienation as a dependent variable, with what
J63 0480  3    socio-structural factors is it most highly associated?
J63 0490  1    Considered as an independent variable, how does it
J63 0490  9    affect behavior in various sectors of life? Until such
J63 0500  8    work is done, there must remain the nagging suspicion
J63 0510  5    that alienation may be little more than an expression
J63 0520  3    of the malaise of the intellectual, who, rejected by
J63 0520 12    and in turn rejecting the larger society, projects
J63 0530  8    his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen.
J63 0540  6       I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this
J63 0550  6    kind of work. Nor do I think that alienation is nothing
J63 0560  3    more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual.
J63 0570  1    I am saying only that until a fuller and different
J63 0570 11    kind of evidence comes in, any discussion of alienation
J63 0580  7    must be understood to have certain important limitations.
J63 0590  3       Until such evidence appears, we must make do with
J63 0600  4    the evidence we have. Here, perhaps, Fromm is vulnerable,
J63 0610  1    for he does not always use the best and most recent
J63 0610 12    evidence available, and he sometimes selects and interprets
J63 0620  7    the evidence in rather special ways. Three examples
J63 0630  5    follow.
J63 0630  6       Fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of
J63 0640  5    production centers around the concepts of the bureaucratization
J63 0650  2    of the corporation, the separation of ownership from
J63 0660  1    control, and the broad (and thus from the point of
J63 0660 11    view of corporate control, ineffective) dispersion
J63 0670  4    of stock ownership. For all these points he relies
J63 0680  4    exclusively on Berle and Means's study of 1932, The
J63 0690  1    Modern Corporation and Private Property. The broad
J63 0690  8    conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed,
J63 0710  7    but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered
J63 0720  6    their empirical support, has suggested important revisions
J63 0730  3    in the general analytic frame of reference, and has
J63 0740  2    sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts
J63 0740  9    in this area. Fromm seems unaware of these developments.
J63 0750  7       Another example is his very infrequent use of the
J63 0760  8    large amount of data from surveys designed to discover
J63 0770  4    what and how people actually do feel and think on a
J63 0780  2    broad range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings
J63 0790 10    just three times. Moreover, the conclusions he draws
J63 0800  7    from the findings are not always the only ones possible.
J63 0810  6    For example, he cites the following data from two studies
J63 0820  5    on job satisfaction: in the first study, 85 per cent
J63 0830  2    of professionals and executives, 64 per cent of white
J63 0830 11    collar people, and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed
J63 0840  9    satisfaction with their jobs; in the second study,
J63 0850  7    the percentages were 86 for professionals, 74 for managerial
J63 0860  4    persons, 42 for commercial employees, 56 for skilled
J63 0870  2    workers, and 48 for semi-skilled workers. He concludes
J63 0870 11    that these data show a "remarkably high" percentage
J63 0890  7    of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among
J63 0900  5    factory and clerical workers. Starting from other value
J63 0910  4    premises than Fromm's, some analysts might conclude
J63 0920  1    that the percentages really tell us very little at
J63 0920 10    all, while others might even conclude that the figures
J63 0930  7    are remarkably low. Eric Hoffer, for example, once
J63 0940  4    said that America was a paradise- the only one in the
J63 0950  4    history of the world- for workingmen and small children.
J63 0960  1    What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data
J63 0960 11    is not the only one possible, it is precisely the one
J63 0970  9    we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes
J63 0980  4    that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied.
J63 0990  2    Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction
J63 1000  1    conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945,
J63 1000  9    in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought
J63 1010 11    to turn out as much as he could in a day's work, while
J63 1020  8    41 per cent said he should not do his best but should
J63 1030  5    turn out only the average amount. Fromm says these
J63 1040  1    data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are
J63 1040  9    widespread. That is one way to read the findings, but
J63 1050  9    again there are other ways. One might use such findings
J63 1060  5    to indicate the strength of informal primary associations
J63 1070  2    in the factory, an interpretation which would run counter
J63 1080  1    to Fromm's theory of alienation. Or, he might remind
J63 1080 10    Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly
J63 1090  9    low: after all, the medieval guild system was dedicated
J63 1100  6    to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers
J63 1110  5    ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's
J63 1120  1    trade unions announce pretty much the same view.
J63 1120  9       In view of these shortcomings in both the amount
J63 1130  8    and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public
J63 1140  6    opinion, and considering the criticisms which can be
J63 1150  4    brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology,
J63 1160  1    such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously.
J63 1160 11    "Are people happy, are they as satisfied, unconsciously,
J63 1170  7    as they believe themselves to be? Considering the nature
J63 1180  6    of man, and the conditions for happiness, this can
J63 1190  4    hardly be so".
J63 1190  7       The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more
J63 1200  6    basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought. He seems
J63 1210  3    to use the term alienation in two different ways. Sometimes
J63 1220  1    he uses it as a subjective, descriptive term, and sometimes
J63 1220 11    as an objective, diagnostic one. That is, sometimes
J63 1230  7    it is used to describe felt human misery, and other
J63 1240  6    times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and
J63 1250  3    discontent. The failure to keep these two usages distinct
J63 1260  2    presents hazards to the reader. It also permits Fromm
J63 1260 11    to do some dubious things with empirical findings.
J63 1270  7    When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic
J63 1280  6    category, for example, it becomes clear that Fromm
J63 1290  3    would have to say that awareness of alienation goes
J63 1290 12    far toward conquering it. (He in effect does say this
J63 1300 10    in his discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton
J63 1310  7    conformist.) Starting from this, and accepting his
J63 1320  4    estimate of the iniquities of modern society, it would
J63 1330  2    follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation
J63 1330 10    would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported
J63 1340 10    widespread, stated worker satisfaction, rather than
J63 1350  5    widespread, stated worker dissatisfaction.
J63 1360  1       The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which
J63 1370  1    recognizes unconscious motivations, and which rests
J63 1370  7    on certain ethical absolutes, empirical data can be
J63 1380  6    used to support whatever proposition the writer is
J63 1390  4    urging at the moment. Thus, in the example cited above
J63 1400  1    Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the
J63 1400 11    workers are being deprived unconsciously, unknowingly,
J63 1410  4    of fulfillment, and then supports this with survey
J63 1420  4    data reporting conscious, experienced frustrations.
J63 1430  1    He has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say
J63 1430 13    they are dissatisfied, this shows conscious alienation;
J63 1440  5    if they say they are satisfied, this shows unconscious
J63 1450  4    alienation. This sort of manipulation is especially
J63 1460  2    troublesome in Fromm's work because, although his system
J63 1470  1    is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions,
J63 1470  8    he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn
J63 1490  7    both from social science and from his own consulting
J63 1500  5    room. While the "empirical psychoanalytic" label which
J63 1510  3    Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his
J63 1510 13    underlying philosophy, it does increase the marketability
J63 1520  7    of his product.
J63 1530  1       The final example of the failure to use available
J63 1530 10    evidence, though evidence of a different kind from
J63 1540  8    that which has so far been considered, comes from Fromm's
J63 1550  4    treatment of some other writers who have dealt with
J63 1560  3    the same themes. In a brief chapter dealing with "Various
J63 1570  1    Other Diagnoses", he quotes isolated passages from
J63 1570  8    some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own,
J63 1580  8    and finds it "most remarkable that a critical view
J63 1590  5    of twentieth-century society was already held by a
J63 1600  3    number of thinkers living in the nineteenth ...". He
J63 1600 12    finds it equally "remarkable that their critical diagnosis
J63 1610  8    and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves
J63 1620  9    and with the critics of the twentieth century". There
J63 1630  5    is nothing remarkable about this at all. It is largely
J63 1640  5    a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes.
J63 1650  1    There is a difference between evidence and illustration,
J63 1650  9    and Fromm's citation of the other diagnosticians fits
J63 1660  7    the latter category. Glance at the list: Burckhardt,
J63 1670  6    Tolstoy, Proudhon, Thoreau, London, Marx, Tawney, Mayo,
J63 1680  5    Durkheim, Tannenbaum, Mumford, A. R. Heron, Huxley,
J63 1690  4    Schweitzer, and Einstein. This is a delightfully motley
J63 1700  2    collection. One can make them say the same thing only
J63 1700 12    by not listening to them very carefully and hearing
J63 1710  9    only what one wants to hear. The method of selection
J63 1720  7    Fromm uses achieves exactly that. Furthermore, the
J63 1730  2    list is interesting for its omissions. It omits, for
J63 1740  1    example, practically the whole line of great nineteenth
J63 1740  9    century English social critics, nearly all the great
J63 1750  7    writers whose basic position is religious, and all
J63 1760  5    those who are with more or less accuracy called Existentialists.
J63 1770  2    Of course, the list also excludes all writers who are
J63 1780  1    fairly "optimistic" about the modern situation; these,
J63 1780  8    almost by definition, are spokesmen for an alienated
J63 1790  8    ideology. It is not hard to find that concurrence of
J63 1800  6    opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore
J63 1810  4    all who hold a different opinion.
J63 1810 10       Turning from these problems of the use of evidence,
J63 1820  8    one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis,
J63 1830  4    which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important
J63 1840  4    terms. One such instance has already been presented:
J63 1850  1    his use of alienation. The only other one I shall mention
J63 1850 12    here is his use of the term capitalism.
J63 1860  8       For Fromm, capitalism is the enemy, the root of
J63 1870  6    all evil. It is of course useful to have a sovereign
J63 1880  1    cause in one's social criticism, for it makes diagnosis
J63 1880 10    and prescription much easier than they might otherwise
J63 1890  8    be.
