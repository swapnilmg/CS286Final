J47 0010  1    _9._
J47 0010  2       Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants
J47 0010  9    and young children can and do solve many problems at
J47 0020  9    a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining
J47 0030  5    objects and counting them. After they have developed
J47 0040  3    concepts, they are free from the necessity of manipulating
J47 0050  1    objects; they do symbolically what they once had to
J47 0050 10    do concretely. The ability to think seems to increase
J47 0060  8    consistently with age. One experiment showed the greatest
J47 0070  5    one-year difference occurring between the eleventh
J47 0080  3    and twelfth years.
J47 0080  6    _10._
J47 0080  7       Many studies indicate that elementary-school children's
J47 0090  4    interests cover the whole field of science; that their
J47 0100  3    questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes
J47 0110  1    and events; and that as they mature their interests
J47 0110 10    and capabilities change and broaden.
J47 0120  4    _EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS_
J47 0120  6       How a child feels about himself, about other people,
J47 0130  7    and about the tasks confronting him in school may have
J47 0140  6    as much influence on his success in school as his physical
J47 0150  4    and intellectual characteristics. A considerable amount
J47 0160  1    of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure
J47 0160 11    child is not likely to do well in school subjects.
J47 0170  8    Emotional maturity is the result of many factors, the
J47 0180  5    principal ones being the experiences of the first few
J47 0190  3    years of the child's life. However, the teacher who
J47 0190 12    understands the influence of emotions on behavior may
J47 0200  8    be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence,
J47 0210  6    security, and satisfaction.
J47 0220  1       Concerning this responsibility of the teacher, suggestions
J47 0220  7    for helping children gain better control of the emotions
J47 0230  8    are presented in Chapter 11. The following generalizations
J47 0240  5    about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school
J47 0250  4    children may be helpful.
J47 0250  8    _1._
J47 0250  9       Typically, the young child's emotional reactions
J47 0260  6    last for a relatively short time, as contrasted to
J47 0270  5    those of an adult.
J47 0270  9    _2._
J47 0270 10       As the child grows older, his emotional reactions
J47 0280  5    lead to "moods", or emotional states drawn out over
J47 0290  4    a period of time and expressed slowly, rather than
J47 0290 13    in short, abrupt outbursts.
J47 0300  4    _3._
J47 0300  5       Studies of the growth and decline of children's
J47 0310  3    fears indicate that fears due to strange objects, noises,
J47 0320  1    falling, and unexpected movement decline during the
J47 0320  8    preschool years, but that fears of the dark, of being
J47 0330  9    alone, and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase.
J47 0340  4    _4._
J47 0340  5       Ridiculing a child for being afraid or forcing him
J47 0350  4    to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of
J47 0350 14    dealing with the problem; more effective solutions
J47 0360  7    include explanations, the example of another child,
J47 0370  6    or conditioning by associating the feared object, place,
J47 0380  3    or person with something pleasant.
J47 0380  8    _5._
J47 0380  9       Children need help in learning to control their
J47 0390  8    emotions. The young child learns from parents and teachers
J47 0400  6    that temper tantrums, screaming, kicking, and hitting
J47 0410  3    will not get him what he wants; the older child learns
J47 0420  1    that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval
J47 0420  9    by his peers, and, therefore, makes a real effort to
J47 0430  8    control his emotions.
J47 0440  1    _6._
J47 0440  1       Children differ widely in their emotional responses.
J47 0440  8    Among infants the patterns of emotional responses are
J47 0450  7    similar; as the influence of learning and environment
J47 0460  5    are felt, emotional behavior becomes individualized.
J47 0470  1    _SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS_
J47 0470  3       Although no national norms exist for the social
J47 0480  4    development of children, the teacher can find a great
J47 0490  1    deal of information concerning types of social behavior
J47 0490  9    normally displayed by children at various age levels.
J47 0500  7    The following summary will give the student some idea
J47 0510  6    about the social characteristics of elementary-school
J47 0520  1    children; the student will certainly want to explore
J47 0520  9    more deeply into the fascinating study of immature
J47 0530  8    individuals, struggling to meet their developmental
J47 0540  5    needs, and at the same time trying to learn the rules
J47 0550  3    of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups
J47 0550 13    in which they hold membership.
J47 0560  4    _1._
J47 0560  5       During early childhood, children are more interested
J47 0570  4    in the approval of their parents and teachers than
J47 0580  1    they are in the approval of other children; after they
J47 0580 11    have been in school a few years, their interest in
J47 0590  8    playmates of their own age increases, and their interest
J47 0600  4    in adults decreases; the child who had once considered
J47 0610  2    it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and
J47 0610 12    family gatherings now considers it a bore. In late
J47 0620  9    childhood the influence of the group on the social
J47 0630  7    behavior of the child continues to increase; the group
J47 0640  3    sets the styles in clothing, the kind of play engaged
J47 0640 13    in, and the ideals of right and wrong behavior.
J47 0650  9    _2._
J47 0650 10       In early childhood the choice of a companion is
J47 0660  7    likely to be for another child of his own age or a
J47 0670  5    year or two older, who can do the things he likes to
J47 0670 17    do; such factors as sex, intelligence, and status in
J47 0680  9    the group do not influence his choice much at this
J47 0690  7    time.
J47 0690  8    _3._
J47 0690  9       In later childhood, an interest in team games replaces
J47 0700  7    individual play; loyalty to the group, a feeling of
J47 0710  4    superiority over those who are not members, and unwillingness
J47 0720  1    to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant
J47 0720 11    traits.
J47 0730  1    _4._
J47 0730  2       During early childhood boys tease and bully, on
J47 0730 10    the average, more than girls; those who feel inferior
J47 0740  8    or insecure engage in these activities more than do
J47 0750  6    well-adjusted children.
J47 0750  9    _5._
J47 0750 10       During late childhood boys like to tease, jostle,
J47 0760  8    and talk smart to girls; girls, who are more mature
J47 0770  6    than boys, frown upon the youthful antics of boys of
J47 0780  4    their own age.
J47 0780  7    _6._
J47 0780  8       By the time pupils reach the sixth grade, their
J47 0790  3    ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed;
J47 0800  1    they exhibit a keen interest in social, political,
J47 0800  9    and economic problems, but they frequently have vague
J47 0810  6    and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather
J47 0820  5    glibly in their routine school work.
J47 0820 11    _7._
J47 0820 12       Between the ages of two and four years, negativism
J47 0830  9    or resistance to adult authority is noticeable; after
J47 0840  5    the fourth year it begins to decline. However, as we
J47 0850  4    have seen, in later childhood the child begins to substitute
J47 0860  2    the standards of the peer group for those of parents
J47 0860 12    and teachers.
J47 0870  1    _8._
J47 0870  2       The elementary-school child grows gradually in his
J47 0870 10    ability to work in groups. The child in the primary
J47 0880 10    grades can play harmoniously with one companion, but
J47 0890  5    his desire to be first in everything gets him into
J47 0900  4    trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be
J47 0900 14    with people, but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate.
J47 0910  9    In the middle grades, however, he begins to participate
J47 0920  6    more effectively in group activities such as selecting
J47 0930  4    a leader, helping to make plans and carry on group
J47 0940  2    activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise.
J47 0940 10    #WHY THE TEACHER SHOULD STUDY THE INDIVIDUAL PUPIL#
J47 0950  8    Much progress has been made in the last two decades
J47 0960  8    in developing techniques for understanding children,
J47 0970  2    yet in almost any classroom today can be found children
J47 0980  1    whose needs are not being met by the school program.
J47 0980 11    Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability
J47 0990  8    would permit; others never seem able to enter fully
J47 1000  6    into the life of the classroom. These children have
J47 1010  2    been described as those who were trying to say something
J47 1010 12    to adults who did not understand.
J47 1020  5       Many school systems now employ school psychologists
J47 1030  2    and child guidance specialists. These specialists perform
J47 1040  2    valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify
J47 1040 10    children who need special attention, by suggesting
J47 1050  7    ways of meeting the needs of individual children in
J47 1060  5    the regular classroom, and by providing clinical services
J47 1070  2    for severely maladjusted children. It is the classroom
J47 1080  1    teacher, however, who has daily contacts with pupils,
J47 1080  9    and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological
J47 1090  7    principles into practice. Indeed, a study of the individual
J47 1100  7    child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school
J47 1110  5    teacher, rather than merely an additional chore.
J47 1120  2       Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools
J47 1130  1    have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade
J47 1130 10    into groups on the basis of test scores solves the
J47 1140  7    problem of meeting the needs of individuals. What they
J47 1150  3    should recognize is that children who have been placed
J47 1160  1    in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still
J47 1160 12    differ widely in attributes that influence success,
J47 1170  6    and that they still must be treated as individuals.
J47 1180  4    Although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining
J47 1190  2    standards, he must also be concerned about understanding
J47 1200  1    differences in ability, background, and experience.
J47 1210  1    _FACTORS THAT INHIBIT LEARNING AND LEAD TO MALADJUSTMENT_
J47 1210  6       Studies conducted in various sections of the United
J47 1220  5    States indicate that many children in elementary schools
J47 1230  2    are maladjusted emotionally, and that many of them
J47 1230 10    are failing to make satisfactory progress in school
J47 1240  8    subjects. One study, which involved 1,524 pupils in
J47 1250  6    grades one to six, found that 12 percent of the pupils
J47 1260  4    were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were
J47 1260 12    reading a year below capacity. It is apparent, therefore,
J47 1270  9    that the teacher needs to know what factors have a
J47 1280  8    vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children.
J47 1290  4    When a child fails to meet the standards of the school
J47 1300  3    in his rate of learning, insecurity, unhappiness, and
J47 1300 11    other forms of maladjustment frequently follow. These
J47 1310  7    maladjustments in turn inhibit learning, and a vicious
J47 1320  7    cycle is completed.
J47 1320 10       It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the
J47 1330  9    child who is not achieving in accordance with his known
J47 1340  6    ability is just plain lazy, or that the child who lacks
J47 1350  4    interest in school, who dislikes the teacher, or who
J47 1360  1    is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent. The causes
J47 1360  9    of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical
J47 1370  8    factors, such as defective speech or hearing, impaired
J47 1380  5    vision, faulty motor coordination, a frail constitution,
J47 1390  2    chronic disease, malnutrition, and glandular malfunctioning.
J47 1400  1    They may be caused by poor health habits, such as faulty
J47 1400 12    eating and sleeping habits. They may be related to
J47 1410  9    mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types
J47 1420  6    of school work. The curriculum may be too difficult
J47 1430  4    for some and too easy for others. Teaching methods,
J47 1440  1    learning materials, and promotion policies may inhibit
J47 1440  8    learning and lead to maladjustments for some children.
J47 1450  6    Unwholesome family relations, broken homes, and undesirable
J47 1460  5    community influences may also be contributing factors.
J47 1470  2    This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit
J47 1480  1    learning and contribute to maladjustment among children.
J47 1480  8    Moreover, these conditions do not influence all children
J47 1490  8    in the same manner. A vision handicap that may produce
J47 1500  6    nervous tension and reading disability for one child
J47 1520  4    may spur another child on to even greater achievement
J47 1530  1    in reading. An impoverished home that may discourage
J47 1530  9    one child may constitute the motivation causing another
J47 1540  5    to work harder for successful achievement in school.
J47 1550  4    At any rate, the teacher who recognizes common causes
J47 1560  2    of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do
J47 1560  9    a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement,
J47 1570  8    failure, and maladjustment.
J47 1580  1    #SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN#
J47 1580  6    Successful teaching involves getting enough information
J47 1590  5    about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he
J47 1600  6    does in certain situations and how his achievement
J47 1610  1    in school is being influenced by various factors in
J47 1610 10    his environment. The classroom teacher cannot be expected
J47 1620  7    to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of
J47 1630  6    child study as the clinical psychologist; he cannot
J47 1640  3    be expected to administer all the tests and gather
J47 1640 12    all the information needed about each child in his
J47 1650  7    classroom. He can be expected, however, to examine
J47 1660  4    and interpret the information already available; to
J47 1670  2    refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual
J47 1670 11    children; and to utilize opportunities, arising in
J47 1680  7    connection with regular classroom activities, for gaining
J47 1690  5    a better understanding of his pupils. This section
J47 1700  4    deals with some of the sources of information that
J47 1710  1    can be tapped by the classroom teacher; Chapter 15
J47 1710 10    provides more detailed information about specific techniques
J47 1720  6    used in evaluating pupil progress.
J47 1730  2    _CUMULATIVE RECORDS_
J47 1730  4       Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative
J47 1740  5    records of pupils. These records, when systematically
J47 1750  1    maintained, provide much information about the children,
J47 1750  8    which the teacher can use in guidance, instruction,
J47 1760  8    grouping, and reporting to parents. Each teacher has
J47 1770  6    in his classroom a metal file, equipped with a lock,
J47 1780  4    which is used to store cumulative record folders. During
J47 1790  1    summer vacation periods these records are stored in
J47 1790  9    the office of the principal. Only the teacher and other
J47 1800  8    professional personnel are permitted to see or use
J47 1810  6    these records. Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes
J47 1820  3    is expected to study the information in the cumulative
J47 1820 12    record and to bring it up to date. Some school systems
J47 1830 11    provide written instructions to principals and teachers
J47 1840  5    designating when certain information is to be recorded
J47 1850  5    on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information
J47 1860  3    is to be summarized and used.
