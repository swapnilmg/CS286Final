R02 0010  1    I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different
R02 0010 11    problem, but his agony could have been no greater.
R02 0020  9    The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's
R02 0030  5    tray to the dish pile, and by means of repeated threats,
R02 0040  4    on an ascending scale, seeing that the girls dressed
R02 0050  1    themselves, after a fashion.
R02 0050  5       I was saved from making the decision as the phone
R02 0060  5    rang, and the girls were upon me instantly. Here's
R02 0070  1    a household hint: if you can't find your children,
R02 0070 10    and get tired of calling them, pick up the phone. No
R02 0080  9    matter if your children are at the movies, in school,
R02 0090  6    visiting their grandmother, or on a field trip in some
R02 0100  4    distant city, they will be upon you magically within
R02 0100 13    seconds after you pick up the phone.
R02 0110  7       Jennie and Miranda twined themselves around me,
R02 0120  3    murmuring endearments. Louise climbed onto a stool
R02 0130  1    and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold
R02 0130 12    the phone, claiming my immediate attention on grounds
R02 0140  6    of extreme emergency. Somehow managing to get out a
R02 0150  6    cool, poised, "Won't you hold on a second, please",
R02 0160  2    I covered up the mouthpiece, and with more warmth and
R02 0160 12    less poise, gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment,
R02 0170 10    mostly the latter, including Devil's Island and the
R02 0180  6    remoter reaches of Siberia. I promised to illustrate
R02 0190  5    the lecture, if they so much as breathed till after
R02 0200  3    the call was completed.
R02 0200  7       Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the
R02 0210  5    caller, I resumed my everyday voice. Soon we were deep
R02 0220  4    in a conversation that was interrupted many times by
R02 0220 13    little things like Jennie's holding her breath and
R02 0230  8    pretending to black out, Miranda's dumping the contents
R02 0240  6    of the sugar bowl on the table, and various screeches,
R02 0250  4    thuds, and giggles. Under the circumstances, I had
R02 0260  3    difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the
R02 0260 11    phone, but when I hung up I was reasonably certain
R02 0270  8    that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town
R02 0280  6    meeting the next evening, and how important it was
R02 0290  2    that Hank and I be there.
R02 0290  8       I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated
R02 0300  3    the kitchen, and were playing quietly in the living
R02 0310  1    room. It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted
R02 0310 13    the peace and quiet, instead of carrying out my threats.
R02 0320  9       Resolving to get something done, I started in on
R02 0330  7    the dishes. No. I'm not saying it right. What I meant
R02 0340  6    to say was that I started to start in on the dishes
R02 0350  2    by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink.
R02 0350 11    They looked so formidable, however, so demanding, that
R02 0360  7    I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting
R02 0370  7    to woolgather again, this time about Francesca and
R02 0380  3    her husband. How about them, I thought.
R02 0380 10       Francesca and Herbert were among the few people
R02 0390  8    we knew in Catatonia. We didn't even know them till
R02 0400  7    about a month after we moved- at that time, they had
R02 0410  4    called on us, after I met Fran at a PTA meeting, and
R02 0420  2    had taken us in hand socially. They had been kind to
R02 0420 13    us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant
R02 0430 11    dinners, and for information as to where to shop, which
R02 0440  7    dentist, doctor, plumber, and sitter to call (not that
R02 0450  5    there was much of a choice, since Catatonia was just
R02 0460  2    a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were
R02 0460 12    amazingly thin).
R02 0470  2       They were "personalities". Herb, an expert on narrow
R02 0480  1    ties, thin lapels, and swatches, was men's fashion
R02 0480  9    editor of Parvenu, the weekly magazine with the tremendous
R02 0490  7    circulation. Fran and he had met about two years after
R02 0500  9    she had arrived in Manhattan from Nebraska, or was
R02 0510  4    it Wyoming? She was the daughter and sole heiress of
R02 0520  2    either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and, having
R02 0520 12    arrived in New York with a big bank roll, became a
R02 0530 11    dabbler in various fields. She patronized Greenwich
R02 0540  4    Village artists for awhile, then put some money into
R02 0550  3    a Broadway show which was successful (terrible, but
R02 0550 11    successful). It was during her "writing" period that
R02 0560  8    she and Herb met and decided that they were in love.
R02 0570  9    They were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly
R02 0580  5    recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers,
R02 0590  3    and then they honeymooned in Bermuda. No, not Bermuda.
R02 0600  1    Bermuda was not in style that year. They had honeymooned
R02 0600 11    in Rome; everyone was very high on Rome that year.
R02 0610 10       They had bought their house in Catatonia after investigating
R02 0620  7    all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York; they
R02 0630  6    had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for
R02 0640  5    excellent schools, beaches, and abundance of names.
R02 0650  1       "You are bound to get involved with people when
R02 0650 10    you have children", Fran had told me at our first meeting,
R02 0660 10    "so it is good to know that those with whom you get
R02 0670  9    involved are not just dreary little housewives and
R02 0680  3    dull husbands, but People Who Do Things".
R02 0690  1       I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't
R02 0690 12    escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the
R02 0700 10    right things. Their house was a centuries-old Colonial
R02 0710  8    which they had had restored (guided by an eminent architect)
R02 0720  6    and updated, and added on to. It had a gourmet's corner
R02 0730  4    (instead of a kitchen), a breakfast room, a luncheon
R02 0740  1    room, a dining room, a sitting room, a room for standing
R02 0740 12    up, a party room, dressing rooms for everybody, even
R02 0750  8    a room for mud. It was all set up so there would be
R02 0760  8    no dust anywhere and so that their children would color
R02 0770  3    in the coloring room, paint in the painting room, play
R02 0780  1    with blocks in the block house, and do all the other
R02 0790 11    things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time.
R02 0800  7    Their two boys were "well adjusted" and, like their
R02 0810  4    parents, always did the right thing at the right time
R02 0820  2    and damn the consequences.
R02 0820  6       Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently
R02 0830  3    nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling
R02 0840  3    their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and
R02 0840 10    paintings and other art objects (expensive, but not
R02 0850  8    necessarily valuable, contemporary things). Fran flaunted
R02 0860  4    her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia
R02 0870  3    uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by
R02 0880  1    wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in color;
R02 0880 10    bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes. Sometimes
R02 0890  8    she even wore the uniform in solid, unrelieved black,
R02 0900  5    and with her blonde hair cut so closely, wearing this
R02 0910  3    uniform, she strongly resembled a member of the SS.
R02 0920  1       No one could dislike them, I thought. Sometimes,
R02 0920  9    though, they did not seem quite human. It seemed, indeed,
R02 0930  9    that their house was not so much a home, but rather
R02 0940  8    a perfect stage set, and that they were actors who
R02 0950  3    had been handed fat roles in a successful play, and
R02 0950 13    had talent enough to fill the roles competently, with
R02 0960  8    nice understatement. Practically the only enthusiasm
R02 0970  4    they showed was when they were discussing "names";
R02 0980  2    even brand names. You should hear the reverence in
R02 0990  1    Fran's voice when she said "Baccarat" or "Steuben"
R02 0990  9    or "Madame Alexander". She always let it be known that
R02 1000  9    there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken
R02 1010  9    had been marinated in brandy, and that Koussevitzky's
R02 1020  3    second cousin was an intimate of theirs.
R02 1030  1       I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple
R02 1030 10    were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants
R02 1040  9    of Catatonia were equally unreal. I couldn't feel at
R02 1050  6    home among them. Besides Francesca, there was Blanche.
R02 1060  4    Francesca was pleasant and charming, but Blanche was
R02 1070  2    sweet. Yes, Blanche was very, very sweet- being in
R02 1070 11    her company was like being drowned in warm, melted
R02 1080  8    marshmallows. I had once been a witness when Blanche
R02 1090  5    had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness, "Oh,
R02 1100  2    my souffle has collapsed". Anyone knows how a real,
R02 1110  1    red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe!
R02 1110 10    If Blanche had been honest, she would have yelled,
R02 1120  8    slammed at least a couple of doors, and thrown a few
R02 1130  6    little, valueless things. But dear me, no; not Blanche.
R02 1140  3       After five minutes with Blanche, one might welcome
R02 1150  1    the astringency of Grazie, who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz
R02 1160 10    to Francesca's Perle Mesta. Francesca and Grazie were
R02 1170  7    habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed
R02 1180  6    to be elected co-chairmen, equal bosses, of whatever
R02 1190  4    PTA or civic project was being launched. They were
R02 1200  2    inseparable, not because they were fond of each other,
R02 1200 11    but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other,
R02 1210 10    as they were keen rivals for social leadership. Grazie
R02 1220  5    was mean: quietly mean, and bitterly, unfunnily sarcastic.
R02 1230  3    She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes
R02 1240  3    upon learning that I couldn't drive. Grazie had a small,
R02 1250  1    slick head and her hair and skin were the color of
R02 1250 12    golden toast. She lived in an ultra-modern house whose
R02 1260  9    decoration, appointments, paint, and even pets were
R02 1270  5    chosen to complement her coloring; the pets were a
R02 1280  3    couple of Siamese cats. Her uniform was of rich, raw
R02 1280 13    silk, in a shade which matched her hair, skin, housepaint,
R02 1290  9    and cats, and since she was so thin as to be almost
R02 1300  9    shapeless, she rather resembled a frozen fish stick.
R02 1310  3       The husbands of these women and others I had met
R02 1320  2    in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were,
R02 1320 11    to me at least, indistinguishable. I couldn't tell
R02 1330  6    one from the other. Like Herbert, they were all in
R02 1340  6    communications: radio, television, magazines, and advertising.
R02 1350  3    One or two were writers of books; all were fellows
R02 1360  1    of finite charm. Each had developed a hair-trigger
R02 1360 10    chuckle and the habit of saying "zounds"! in deference
R02 1370  8    to country-squirehood. I never thought I'd live to
R02 1380  7    hear people chuckle and say "zounds"! in real life.
R02 1390  4    I wouldn't have missed it for anything. They were "sincere"-
R02 1400  3    men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile.
R02 1410  2    These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody
R02 1410  9    by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs,
R02 1420 10    while they gazed, misty-eyed with care, into the eyes
R02 1430  6    of the person they were meeting. Could such unadulterated
R02 1440  2    love, for a total stranger, be credited? They were
R02 1450  1    always leaping to light cigarettes, open car doors,
R02 1450  9    fill plates or glasses, and I mistrusted the whole
R02 1460  6    lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake
R02 1470  4    shops that called themselves "Sanitary Bake Shops".
R02 1480  1       "O Pioneers!" I thought, and wondered what kind
R02 1490  2    of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in
R02 1490 10    this suburban frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty
R02 1500  8    gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who
R02 1510  4    never called the school principal "Mister". I sighed,
R02 1520  3    thinking that among other things, people here seemed
R02 1530  1    to be those who would have to cut down if they earned
R02 1530 13    less than $85,000 yearly; people who would give their
R02 1540  7    teeth for a chance to get on "Person to Person"; people
R02 1550  6    who thought it was nice to be important, but not important
R02 1560  4    to be nice; who were more ingratiating than gracious,
R02 1570  2    more personalities than persons. In my estimation,
R02 1570  9    they were people who read Daphne du Maurier, and discussed
R02 1580 10    Kafka; well, not discussed him exactly, but said, "Kafka"!
R02 1590  8    reverently and raised their eyes, as if they were at
R02 1600 10    a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka, which
R02 1610  5    they were, because they had no opinions about Kafka,
R02 1620  2    not having read Kafka. They were, I felt, people invariably
R02 1630  1    trying to prove not who, but what they were, and trying
R02 1630 12    to determine what, not who, others were.
R02 1640  6       Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime, I brought
R02 1650  4    myself back to the tasks at hand. I made plans for
R02 1660  2    the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes
R02 1660 10    all at once, making the beds, and then maybe painting
R02 1670  9    the kitchen. Then, I remembered that the girls had
R02 1680  6    had a banana for dessert every day for the last week.
R02 1690  3    "BANANAS"! Jennie had shouted each time. "They're not
R02 1700  2    dessert! They're not even food. They're just something
R02 1710  1    you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast". I
R02 1710 10    dug around and found a mix, and was able to surprise
R02 1720 10    them with a devil's-food cake with chocolate icing.
R02 1730  5    (Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking:
R02 1740  4    if you can't put garlic in it, put chocolate in it.)
R02 1750  2       The cake was received in a stunned silence that
R02 1750 11    was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills
R02 1760  9    Mama had been providing. Then Jennie closed her eyes,
R02 1770  6    stretched forth her arms, and said: "Take my hand,
R02 1780  4    Louise; I'm a stranger in paradise".
