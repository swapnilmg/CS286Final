J35 0010  1    There are more stems per item in Athabascan, which
J35 0010 10    expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have
J35 0020  6    undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan
J35 0030  5    than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts. This may
J35 0040  3    be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier;
J35 0050  1    or again because the Athabascan languages spread over
J35 0050  9    a very much larger territory (including three wholly
J35 0060  6    separated areas); or both. The differentiation however
J35 0070  4    is not very much greater, as shown by the fact that
J35 0080  4    Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against
J35 0090  1    2.75 for Yokuts, with a slightly greater number of
J35 0090 10    languages represented in our sample: 24 as against
J35 0100  7    21. (On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46, the stem/item
J35 0110  4    rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number
J35 0120  1    of languages.) These general facts are mentioned to
J35 0120  9    make clear that the total situation in the two families
J35 0130  9    is similar enough to warrant comparison.
J35 0140  2       The greatest difference in the two sets of figures
J35 0150  1    is due to differences in the two sets of lists used.
J35 0150 12    These differences in turn result from the fact that
J35 0160  8    my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected
J35 0170  6    mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between
J35 0180  2    illiterate informants and myself, within a compact
J35 0180  9    and uniform territorial area, but that Hoijer's vocabulary
J35 0190  7    is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list
J35 0200  4    which aims at eliminating all items which might be
J35 0210  6    culturally or geographically determined. Swadesh in
J35 0220  2    short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal;
J35 0230  1    I, one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin
J35 0230 11    Valley. The result is that I included 70 animal names,
J35 0240  9    but Swadesh only 4; and somewhat similarly for plants,
J35 0250  6    16 as against 4. Swadesh, and therefore Hoijer, felt
J35 0260  3    compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even
J35 0270  1    genera (fox, vulture, salmon, yellow pine, manzanita);
J35 0270  8    their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted
J35 0280  9    to generalizations or recurrent parts (fish, bird,
J35 0290  5    tree, grass, horn, tail, bark, root). The groups are
J35 0300  4    therefore really non-comparable in content as well
J35 0300 12    as in size.
J35 0310  3       Other classes are included only by myself (interrogatives,
J35 0320  1    adverbs) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer (pronouns,
J35 0320  9    demonstratives).
J35 0330  1       What we have left as reasonably comparable are four
J35 0330 10    classes: (1) body parts and products, which with a
J35 0340  9    proportionally nearly even representation (51 terms
J35 0350  5    out of 253, 25 out of 100) come out with nearly even
J35 0360  3    ratios; 2.6 and 2.7; (2) Nature (29 terms against 17),
J35 0370  2    ratios 3.3 versus 4.1; (3) adjectives (16, 15 terms),
J35 0370 11    ratios 3.9 versus 4.7; (4) verbs (9, 22 terms), ratios
J35 0380  9    4.0 versus 3.4.
J35 0390  1       It will be seen that where the scope is similar,
J35 0390 10    the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher (as
J35 0400  6    indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against
J35 0410  5    3.5 or 4:5) except for verbs, where alone the Athabascan
J35 0420  1    ratio is lower. This exception may be connected with
J35 0420 10    Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs:
J35 0430  9    22% of his total list as against 3.5% in mine. Or the
J35 0440  9    exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar
J35 0450  3    to the Athabascan verb. More word class ratios determined
J35 0460  2    in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the
J35 0470  1    question.
J35 0470  2    #5.#
J35 0470  3    If word classes differ in their resistance or liability
J35 0480  1    to stem replacement within meaning slot, it is conceivable
J35 0480 10    that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence
J35 0490  8    trans-lingually. Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts
J35 0500  6    share 71 identical meanings (with allowance for several
J35 0510  4    near-synonyms like stomach-belly, big-large, long-far,
J35 0520  3    many-much, die-dead, say-speak). For Yokuts, I tabulated
J35 0530  3    these 71 items in five columns, according as they were
J35 0530 13    expressed by 1, 2, 3, 4, and more than 4 stems. The
J35 0540 12    totals for these five categories are not too uneven,
J35 0550  7    namely 20, 15, 11, 16, 9 respectively. For Athabascan,
J35 0560  3    with a greater range of stems, the first two of five
J35 0570  3    corresponding columns were identical, 1 and 2 stems;
J35 0570 11    the three others had to be spread somewhat, and are
J35 0580  9    headed respectively **f; **f; and **f stems. While
J35 0590  6    the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially
J35 0600  3    arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping
J35 0610  2    of more variable material, and they eventuate also
J35 0610 10    in five classes, along a similar scale, containing
J35 0620  7    approximately equal numbers of cases, namely 19, 14,
J35 0630  6    15, 11, 12 in Athabascan.
J35 0630 11       When now we count the frequency of the 71 items
J35 0640  9    in the two language families appearing in the same
J35 0650  4    column or grade, or one column or grade apart, or two
J35 0660  2    or three or four, we find these differences: **f
J35 0660 11       This distribution can be summarized by averaging
J35 0670  6    the distance in grades apart: **f; which, divided by
J35 0680  5    **f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart. If the distribution
J35 0690  3    of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families,
J35 0700  1    the distance would of course be 0. If it were wholly
J35 0700 12    random and unrelated, it would be 2.0, assuming the
J35 0710  9    five classes were equal in n, which approximately
J35 0720  4    they are. The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway
J35 0730  3    between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation,
J35 0740  1    it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of
J35 0740 12    similarity in the behavior even of particular INDIVIDUAL
J35 0750  8    items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement.
J35 0760  7    #6.#
J35 0760  8    In 1960, David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary
J35 0770  5    in some Mon-Khmer Languages AL 2, no. 3, pp. 7-11),
J35 0780  8    which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E
J35 0790  5    language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention
J35 0800  1    rate (**f) in place of original (**f), and his revised
J35 0800 11    100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards
J35 0810  5    Greater Accuracy ... (IJAL 21:121-137). Thomas' findings
J35 0820  5    are, first, "that the individual items vary greatly
J35 0830  4    and unpredictably in their persistence"; but, second,
J35 0840  3    "that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying
J35 0850  1    in their average persistence" (as between M-K and
J35 0850 10    I-E. His first conclusion, on behavior of individual
J35 0860  7    items, is negative, whereas mine (on Ath. and Yok.)
J35 0870  6    was partially positive. His second conclusion, on semantic
J35 0890  3    word classes, agrees with mine. This second conclusion,
J35 0900  1    independently arrived at by independent study of material
J35 0900  9    from two pairs of language families as different and
J35 0910  8    remote from one another as these four are, cannot be
J35 0920  7    ignored.
J35 0920  8       Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving
J35 0930  5    an index of persistence, which weights not only the
J35 0940  3    number of stems ('roots') per meaning, but their relative
J35 0950  1    frequency. Thus his persistence values for some stem
J35 0950  9    frequencies per meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages,
J35 0960  8    100%; stem frequencies 7 and 1, 86%; stem frequencies
J35 0970  7    4 and 4, 64%; stem frequencies 4, 3, and 1, 57%. His
J35 0980  7    formula will have to be weighed, may be altered or
J35 0990  3    improved, and it should be tested on additional bodies
J35 0990 12    of material. But consideration of the frequency of
J35 1000  8    stems per constant meaning seems to be established
J35 1010  5    as having significance in comparative situations with
J35 1020  2    diachronic and classificatory relevance; and Gleason
J35 1030  1    presumably is on the way with a further contribution
J35 1030 10    in this area.
J35 1040  1       As to relative frequencies of competing roots (7-1
J35 1040 10    vs. 4-4, etc.), Thomas with his 'weighting' seems to
J35 1050  7    be the first to have considered the significance this
J35 1060  4    might have. The problem needs further exploration.
J35 1070  2    I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full
J35 1080  1    Yokuts presentation that awaits publication, in which,
J35 1080  8    in listing 'Two-Stem Meanings', I set off by asterisks
J35 1090  7    those forms in which n of stem B was **f of stem
J35 1100  9    AIII the unasterisked ones standing for **f; or under
J35 1110  6    'Four Stems', I set off by asterisks cases where the
J35 1120  4    combined n of stems **f was **f.
J35 1120 11    #7.#
J35 1120 12    These findings, and others which will in time be developed,
J35 1130 10    will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry.
J35 1140  6    If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness
J35 1150  4    of stems, as I am confident will prove to be the case
J35 1160  5    in most languages of the world, why should our basic
J35 1170  1    lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms,
J35 1170 10    but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace
J35 1180  7    much more slowly? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15
J35 1190  5    adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items, his
J35 1200  2    rate of stem replacement would have been lower and
J35 1200 11    the age of Athabascan language separation smaller.
J35 1210  4    And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed
J35 1220  4    since splitting, calculations obviously carry more
J35 1230  1    concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with
J35 1230  9    the most stable units than with variously unstable
J35 1240  5    ones.
J35 1240  6       It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much
J35 1250  6    experience with basic vocabulary in many languages
J35 1260  1    but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable
J35 1260 11    behavior of lexical items. Why then this urge to include
J35 1270 10    unstable items in his basic list? It is the urge to
J35 1280 10    obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural
J35 1290  3    conditioning as possible. And why that insistence?
J35 1300  1    It is the hope of attaining a list of items of UNIVERSAL
J35 1300 13    occurrence. But it is becoming increasingly evident
J35 1310  7    that such a hope is a snare. Not that such a list cannot
J35 1320  9    be constructed; but the nearer it comes to attaining
J35 1330  5    universality, the less significant will it be linguistically.
J35 1340  2    Its terms will tend to be labile or vague, and they
J35 1350  1    will fit actual languages more and more badly.
J35 1350  9       The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics
J35 1360  4    is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning
J35 1370  6    against which the particular forms or terms of languages
J35 1380  3    can be matched as the medium of comparison. The most
J35 1380 13    important quality of the meanings is that they should
J35 1390  9    be as definable as possible. In proportion as meanings
J35 1400  6    are concrete, we can better rely on their being insulated
J35 1410  5    and distinctive. An elephant or a fox or a swan or
J35 1420  2    a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree
J35 1420 12    this quality of obvious, common-sense, indubitable
J35 1430  6    IDENTITY, as do an eye or tooth or nail. They isolate
J35 1440  7    out easily, naturally, and unambiguously from the continuum
J35 1450  4    of nature and existence; and they should be given priority
J35 1460  3    in the basic list as long as they continue to show
J35 1460 14    these qualities.
J35 1470  2       With the universal list as his weapon, Swadesh has
J35 1480  1    extended his march of conquest farther and farther
J35 1480  9    into the past, eight, ten, twelve millennia back. And
J35 1490  6    he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between
J35 1500  3    all Western hemisphere languages. Some of this may
J35 1510  2    prove to be true, or even considerable of it, whether
J35 1510 12    by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence.
J35 1520  7    But the farther out he moves, the thinner will be his
J35 1530  7    hold on conclusive evidence, and the larger the speculative
J35 1540  3    component in his inferences. He has traversed provinces
J35 1550  1    and kingdoms, but he has not consolidated them behind
J35 1550 10    him, nor does he control them. He has announced results
J35 1560  9    on Hokan, Penutian, Uto-Aztecan, and almost all other
J35 1570  7    American families and phyla, and has diagrammed their
J35 1580  4    degree of interrelation; but he has not worked out
J35 1590  2    by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification
J35 1590  8    of even a single family other than Salish. That is
J35 1600 10    his privilege. The remote, cloudy, possible has values
J35 1610  6    of its own- values of scope, stimulus, potential, and
J35 1620  4    imagination. But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics:
J35 1630  3    the aspect of learning the internal organization of
J35 1640  2    obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well
J35 1640 10    as their more remote and elusive external links; of
J35 1650  7    classification first, with elapsed age merely a by-product;
J35 1660  6    of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened
J35 1670  3    in Athabascan, in Yokuts, in Uto-Aztecan in the last
J35 1680  1    few thousand years as well as forecasting what more
J35 1680 10    anciently may have happened between them. This involves
J35 1690  6    step-by-step progress, and such will have to be the
J35 1700  6    day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body
J35 1710  2    of scientific inquiry. If of the founders of glottochronology
J35 1720  1    Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding, and Lees has
J35 1720 10    repudiated his own share in the founding, that is no
J35 1730  9    reason why we should swerve.
J35 1740  1    #8.#
J35 1740  1    There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound
J35 1740 11    by Swadesh's rules and procedure since his predilections
J35 1750  7    and aims have grown so vast. It seems time to consider
J35 1760  8    a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic
J35 1770  3    studies on a more humble, solid, and limited basis.
J35 1780  1       I would propose, first, an abandonment of attempts
J35 1780  9    at a universal lexical list, as intrinsically unachievable,
J35 1790  7    and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is
J35 1800  7    achieved.
J35 1800  8       I would propose, next, as the prime requirement
J35 1810  6    for constitution of new basic lists, items whose forms
J35 1820  4    show as high an empirical retention rate as possible.
J35 1830  1    There would be no conceivable sense in going to the
J35 1830 11    opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are
J35 1840  7    the most unstable. An attempted middle course might
J35 1850  4    lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary
J35 1860  1    from which every fiftieth word was selected.
