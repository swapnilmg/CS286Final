H05 0010  1    #THE RHODE ISLAND PROPERTY TAX#
H05 0010  6    There was a time some years ago when local taxation
H05 0020  3    by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their
H05 0030  1    own operations and a part of the cost of the state
H05 0030 12    government as well. For many years a state tax on cities
H05 0040 10    and towns was paid by the several municipalities to
H05 0050  4    the state from the proceeds of the general property
H05 0060  1    tax. This tax was discontinued in 1936.
H05 0060  8       Since that time the demands of the citizens for
H05 0070  7    new and expanded services have placed financial burdens
H05 0080  3    on the state which could not have been foreseen in
H05 0090  1    earlier years. At the same time there has been an upgrading
H05 0090 12    and expansion of municipal services as well. Thus,
H05 0100  7    there has come into being a situation in which the
H05 0110  6    state must raise all of its own revenues and, in addition,
H05 0120  3    must give assistance to its local governments.
H05 0130  1       This financial assistance from the state has become
H05 0130  8    necessary because the local governments themselves
H05 0140  5    found the property tax, or at least at the rates then
H05 0150  4    existing, insufficient for their requirements.
H05 0160  1       Consequently there have developed several forms
H05 0160  6    of grants-in-aid and shared taxes, as well as the unrestricted
H05 0170  8    grant to local governments for general purposes whose
H05 0180  5    adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax
H05 0190  3    at the state level.
H05 0190  7       Notwithstanding state aid, the local governments
H05 0200  2    are continuing to seek additional revenue of their
H05 0200 10    own by strengthening the property tax. This is being
H05 0210  9    done both by the revaluation of real property and by
H05 0220  6    seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected
H05 0230  3    or ignored.
H05 0230  5       Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island
H05 0240  5    has been generally of a "hands off" nature due possibly
H05 0250  3    to several reasons: (1) local assessors, in the main,
H05 0260  1    are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs,
H05 0260 10    (2) the numerous categories of this component of personal
H05 0270  7    property make locating extremely difficult, and (3)
H05 0280  4    the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating
H05 0290  3    this type of property.
H05 0300  1    _PROBLEMS OF TAXING PERSONAL PROPERTY._
H05 0300  2       Among the many problems in the taxing of personal
H05 0300 11    property, and of movable tangible property in particular,
H05 0310  8    two are significant: (1) situs, (2) fair and equitable
H05 0320  7    assessment of value. These problems are not local to
H05 0330  6    Rhode Island, but are recognized as common to all states.
H05 0340  4    _SITUS OF PROPERTY._
H05 0340  7       Although the laws of the various states, in general,
H05 0350  4    specify the situs of property, i.e., residence or domicile
H05 0360  3    of the owner, or location of the property, the exceptions
H05 0370  1    regarding boats, airplanes, mobile homes, etc., seem
H05 0370  8    to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination
H05 0380  7    point for assessment.
H05 0390  1       Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate
H05 0390  9    is taxable in the town in which it is situated. It
H05 0400  8    also provides for the taxation of all personal property,
H05 0410  3    belonging to inhabitants of the state, both tangible
H05 0420  1    and intangible, and the tangible personal property
H05 0420  8    of non-residents in this state. In defining personal
H05 0430  7    property, it specifically mentions "all ships or vessels,
H05 0440  5    at home or abroad".
H05 0440  9       Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner
H05 0450  7    has a place of abode the greater portion of the year.
H05 0460  5    Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned
H05 0470  3    in the statute, this is cancelled out by the provision
H05 0480  1    that definite kinds of property "and all other tangible
H05 0480 10    property" situated or being in any town is taxable
H05 0490  9    where the property is situated. This would seem to
H05 0500  5    fix the tax situs of all movable personal property
H05 0510  1    at its location on December 31.
H05 0510  7       Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category,
H05 0520  5    as well as motor vehicles. The location of the latter
H05 0530  4    now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration,
H05 0540  1    and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor
H05 0540 11    vehicle as being situated where it is garaged. Obviously,
H05 0550  9    it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle
H05 0560  6    might be on the 31st day of December. In view of the
H05 0570  5    acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for
H05 0580  2    tax purposes, in the absence of any specific provision
H05 0580 11    it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same
H05 0590  8    interpretation to boats or aircraft.
H05 0600  2       A recent example of this problem is the flying of
H05 0600 12    six airplanes, on December 31, 1960, from the Newport
H05 0610  9    Airpark in Middletown, to the North Central Airport
H05 0620  6    in Smithfield. This situation resulted in both towns
H05 0630  5    claiming the tax, and probably justifiably. Middletown
H05 0640  2    bases its claim on the general provision of the law
H05 0640 12    that "all rateable property, both tangible and intangible,
H05 0650  7    shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in
H05 0660  9    which such owner shall have had his actual place of
H05 0670  4    abode for the larger portion of the twelve (12) months
H05 0680  1    next preceding the first day of April in each year".
H05 0680 11       The Smithfield tax assessor, in turn, claims the
H05 0690  8    tax under the provision of law "... and all other tangible
H05 0700  8    personal property situated or being in any town, in
H05 0710  5    or upon any ... place of storage ... shall be taxed
H05 0720  1    to such person ... in the town where said property
H05 0720 11    is situated".
H05 0730  1    _ASSESSMENT OF VALUE._
H05 0730  4       This problem of fair and equitable assessment of
H05 0740  2    value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination
H05 0740 13    of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors,
H05 0750  8    who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel
H05 0760  5    taking an individualistic approach to the problem.
H05 0770  4    This accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices
H05 0780  2    of movable tangible property in the various municipalities
H05 0780 10    in Rhode Island.
H05 0790  3       This condition will undoubtedly continue until such
H05 0800  2    time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established,
H05 0810  1    or through mutual agreement of the local assessing
H05 0810  9    officials for a method of standard assessment practice
H05 0820  5    to be adopted.
H05 0820  8       The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its
H05 0830  7    publication once commented: "
H05 0840  1       The most realistic way of facing up to this problem
H05 0840 11    would be to have the State take over full responsibility
H05 0850 10    for assessing all taxable property. An adequately staffed
H05 0860  7    and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform
H05 0870  5    methods and standards which would go far toward producing
H05 0880  3    equitable assessments on all properties throughout
H05 0890  1    the State. A single statewide assessing unit would
H05 0890  9    eliminate the differences and complications that are
H05 0900  5    inherent in a system of 39 different and independent
H05 0910  3    assessing units".
H05 0910  5       The Institute of Public Administration, in its report
H05 0920  5    to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959, recommended
H05 0930  4    "consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property
H05 0940  3    tax administration in a single state agency professionally
H05 0950  1    organized and equipped for the job". The resulting
H05 0950  9    setup, it was declared, "would be similar to that which
H05 0960  8    is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan
H05 0970  6    counties as large or larger than Rhode Island".
H05 0980  2    _PRACTICES IN RHODE ISLAND._
H05 0980  6       To determine the practice and attitude of municipal
H05 0990  5    governments concerning tangible movable property, a
H05 1000  2    questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors
H05 1000 10    or boards of assessors in Rhode Island.
H05 1010  7       The replies from each individual town are not given
H05 1020  6    in detail because the questions asked the personal
H05 1030  2    opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily
H05 1030 11    the established policy of the town in each case. There
H05 1040 10    are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among
H05 1050  6    the assessors as a whole and among the public officials
H05 1060  4    in each town. These opinions of the assessors are of
H05 1070  3    significance in indicating what their thinking seems
H05 1070 10    to be at the present time.
H05 1080  4       In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats,
H05 1090  3    airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles,
H05 1100  1    nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did
H05 1100 11    not. The wording of the question was quite general
H05 1110  7    and may have been subject to different interpretations.
H05 1120  2    One assessor checked boats only, another trailers and
H05 1130  2    tractors, one mentioned house trailers, and two others
H05 1130 10    referred to trailers without specifying the type. In
H05 1140  8    two cases, airplanes only were indicated.
H05 1150  3       It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant
H05 1160  2    in each individual situation, but the conclusion may
H05 1160 10    be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal
H05 1170  9    property, and of the remainder only certain types are
H05 1180  5    valued for tax purposes. Boats were indicated specifically
H05 1190  2    by only one of the five towns known to tax boats. It
H05 1200  2    would seem, then, that movable property and equipment
H05 1200 10    is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are
H05 1210  9    taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient
H05 1220  4    for that particular kind of personal property.
H05 1230  1       So few answered the question relating to their efforts
H05 1230 10    to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive.
H05 1240  8    Only four towns indicated that they made any more than
H05 1250  7    a normal effort to list property of this kind.
H05 1260  4       Of greater interest is a question as to whether
H05 1270  1    movable property was assessed according to its location
H05 1270  9    or ownership. Fifteen stated that it was according
H05 1280  7    to location, four by residence of the owner, and nineteen
H05 1290  6    did not answer.
H05 1290  9       Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in
H05 1300  6    favor of improved means for assessing movable personal
H05 1310  2    property, and only five were opposed. Seven others
H05 1310 10    expressed no opinion. On this point there was fairly
H05 1320  9    general agreement that assessors would like to do more
H05 1330  7    than they are doing now. It is not clear, however,
H05 1340  3    whether they are thinking of all movable property or
H05 1350  1    only of boats, trailers, aircraft or certain other
H05 1350  9    types of personal property whose assessment would be
H05 1360  6    advantageous to their particular towns.
H05 1370  1       Another question that was asked of the assessors
H05 1370  9    was whether they favored the assessment of movable
H05 1380  7    property at its location or at the residence of the
H05 1390  6    owner. Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in
H05 1400  3    which it is located and eleven preferred assessment
H05 1400 11    by the town in which the owner resides. Ten others
H05 1410  8    made no reply. Of those who have an opinion, it seems
H05 1420  6    that assessment by location is preferred. There was
H05 1430  2    one vote for location being the place where the property
H05 1430 12    is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months
H05 1440 10    preceding the assessment date.
H05 1450  2       To summarize, it may be said that there is no one
H05 1460  1    prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to
H05 1460  9    the taxation of movable property, that assessors would
H05 1470  7    like to see an improvement, and of those who have an
H05 1480  7    opinion, that assessment by the town of location is
H05 1490  2    preferred on the basis of their present knowledge.
H05 1490 10    The need for greater knowledge is evident from their
H05 1500  7    replies.
H05 1500  8    #BOATS AS PERSONAL PROPERTY#
H05 1510  2    _TAXING OF BOATS._
H05 1510  5       Interest has been shown for a number of years by
H05 1520  4    local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats.
H05 1530  1    Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with
H05 1530 10    placing a valuation upon real and personal property,
H05 1540  6    but they also have the responsibility to raise by a
H05 1550  5    tax "a sum not less than nor more than" a specified
H05 1560  1    amount as ordered by a city council or financial town
H05 1560 11    meeting.
H05 1570  1       It has been obvious to the assessors, particularly
H05 1570  9    those in shore communities, that boats comprise the
H05 1580  6    largest category of tangible personal property which
H05 1590  3    they have been unable to reach. Through their professional
H05 1600  2    organization, the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association
H05 1610  1    the question of taxing boats long has been debated
H05 1610 10    and discussed. No satisfactory solution has been found,
H05 1620  7    but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in
H05 1630  4    the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence
H05 1640  1    on the part of the assessors.
H05 1640  7       It has been estimated that the value of boats in
H05 1650  6    Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty
H05 1660  3    million dollars, excluding commercial boats. It is
H05 1660 10    obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source
H05 1670  8    of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a
H05 1680  6    substantial amount of such property would be subject
H05 1690  2    to taxation.
H05 1690  4       It is known that at least five towns (Barrington,
H05 1700  1    Bristol, Narragansett, Newport and Westerly) place
H05 1700  7    some value on some boats for tax purposes. However,
H05 1710  9    few are taxed, and the owners and location of most
H05 1720  7    boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment
H05 1730  5    of town valuations.
H05 1730  8       No one really knows how many boats there actually
H05 1740  6    are or what their aggregate value may be. Slightly
H05 1750  3    more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast
H05 1750 12    Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating
H05 1760 10    law. Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered
H05 1770  8    with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end
H05 1780  6    of the 1960 boating season, but many had been taken
H05 1790  3    out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane
H05 1790 14    brought the season to an early close.
H05 1800  7       The assessors' association, meeting at Narragansett
H05 1810  4    in September 1960, devoted its session to a discussion
H05 1820  2    of the boat problem.
