P05 0010  1       The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture,
P05 0010  9    in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu,
P05 0020  9    where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu
P05 0030  6    strain. The Ainus were a primitive people, already
P05 0040  3    living on the island before the principal ancestors
P05 0050  1    of the Japanese came from Southern Asia. Apparently
P05 0050  9    they were of Caucasian blood. They had white skins
P05 0060  6    and blue eyes; all their men were bearded, and many
P05 0070  5    of their women were beautiful. A pitiful few of them
P05 0080  2    are left now, to subsist mainly on the tourist trade
P05 0080 12    and to sing their ancient tribal chants, which have
P05 0090  7    the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American
P05 0100  6    Indians. Most of them have been assimilated, but sometimes
P05 0110  3    a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy
P05 0120  2    than the average Japanese, and occasionally a girl
P05 0120 10    will be strikingly lovely, her coloring warmed and
P05 0130  6    improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun
P05 0140  6    tint of the invaders from the South.
P05 0140 13       Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions.
P05 0150  8    She was taller than most Japanese girls, and had the
P05 0160  7    exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is
P05 0170  5    lucky enough to be tall. Her nose was higher of bridge,
P05 0180  2    her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to
P05 0180 12    sunburn, and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears
P05 0190 10    had given her teeth that were white and regular and
P05 0200  7    strong. Her mouth, soft and full, was something for
P05 0210  3    any man to dream about. She had black eyes, long and
P05 0220  1    intriguingly tilted, and the way she walked was melody.
P05 0220 10       She had been in Japan just one week. It was an alien
P05 0230 11    land, and she hated it intensely; she was already considering
P05 0240  6    putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego,
P05 0250  6    Bremerton, the Great Lakes, Pensacola- any place the
P05 0270  6    Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission
P05 0280  1    if the request were not granted. Anywhere would be
P05 0280 10    better than the land of her ancestors.
P05 0290  6       There was nothing wrong with her job. Tommy had
P05 0300  4    been assigned to the psychopathic ward. There were
P05 0310  1    no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes
P05 0310  9    teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage
P05 0320  8    counselor- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the
P05 0330  6    States to preserve a marriage- but mental health as
P05 0340  3    a rule was very high. At present the doctor's main
P05 0340 13    concern was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms
P05 0350 10    were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships
P05 0360  8    sunk too close inshore, because the work involved setting
P05 0370  5    off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours. Tommy was
P05 0380  2    interested in psychiatry, because there was much an
P05 0380 10    understanding nurse could do to help the patients.
P05 0390  8       But she suffered in her off-duty hours. Such as
P05 0400  6    now, when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at
P05 0410  2    the Officers' Club, having coffee and a hamburger to
P05 0410 11    sustain her until dinnertime. She had changed into
P05 0420  8    a cocktail dress, and the whole evening should have
P05 0430  5    been before her, but already she was beginning to get
P05 0440  3    a tight feeling at the back of her neck. This was one
P05 0440 15    of the Navy's crossroads- you find them all around
P05 0450  6    the world. Ships from the West Coast rotated on six-month
P05 0460  8    tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet, and Yokosuka
P05 0470  4    was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for maintenance,
P05 0480  2    upkeep and shore liberty. Sooner or later, all the
P05 0480 11    gray Navy ships came in here; if Tommy sat long enough,
P05 0490 11    she would be sure to see all the young officers she
P05 0500  8    had met in San Diego and Long Beach. And she wanted
P05 0510  5    desperately to see someone she had known back there.
P05 0520  2       She felt, rather than saw, the approach of the good-looking
P05 0530  1    young man. He came through from the Fleet Bar, which
P05 0530 11    was stag, with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he
P05 0540 10    carried. When he saw Tommy sitting alone, the tinkling
P05 0550  5    sound stopped. He was perhaps a trifle tipsy, having
P05 0560  3    been long at sea where drinking is not permitted, and
P05 0560 13    consequently out of practice; he wore a brown tweed
P05 0570  9    sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong, and
P05 0580  6    he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant. Probably
P05 0590  4    off one of the carriers- an aviator. There was a fifty-fifty
P05 0600  5    chance, perhaps, that he would be unmarried, and an
P05 0610  1    even more slender chance that his approach would be
P05 0610 10    different. Japan did something to a man- and it wasn't
P05 0620  9    just Japan, either, because the same thing applied
P05 0630  5    anywhere overseas. It was as if foreign duty implied
P05 0640  2    and excused license; it intimated that the folks at
P05 0640 11    home would never know about it, and, therefore, why
P05 0650  8    not?
P05 0650  9       Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke,
P05 0660  8    and it was no different.
P05 0670  1       "Harro, girl-san"! he said, turning on what was
P05 0670 10    meant to be charm. "You catchee boy-furiendo? Maybe
P05 0680  7    you likee date with me"?
P05 0690  1       "I beg your pardon"! Tommy said out of her cold
P05 0691  1    rage. "I don't believe I know you, and I can't understand
P05 0700 11    your quaint brand of English- it was meant to be English,
P05 0710 11    wasn't it"?
P05 0720  2       The nice-looking young officer fell back on his
P05 0720 11    heels, open-mouthed and blushing. At least, he had
P05 0730  9    the decency to blush, she thought.
P05 0740  3       "Oh- I'm sorry! You see, I thought- I mean I really
P05 0750  5    had no idea"-
P05 0750  8       "Oh, yes- you had ideas"! Tommy interrupted furiously.
P05 0760  4    "All wrong ones"! Then she jerked her thumb toward
P05 0770  5    the door in a very American gesture, and dropped into
P05 0780  2    Navy slang. "Take off, fly-boy"!
P05 0780  8       "Uh- sorry"! he muttered, and took off, obviously
P05 0790  8    feeling like a fool. The trouble was that there was
P05 0800  7    no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy. She felt
P05 0810  3    like a fool, too.
P05 0810  7       It hadn't been this way in college, or in nurses'
P05 0820  5    training; it wasn't this way in the hospital at San
P05 0830  3    Diego. Everybody had accepted her for what she was-
P05 0830 12    a very charming girl. Nobody had addressed her in broken
P05 0840 10    English at any of those places, nobody had suggested
P05 0850  7    that she wasn't American. There are Spanish girls who
P05 0860  6    look like Tommy Momoyama, brunettes with a Moorish
P05 0870  3    hint of the Orient in their faces; there are beauties
P05 0880  1    from the Balkan states who are similarly endowed, and-
P05 0880 10    back in the blessed United States- they were regarded
P05 0890  7    simply as pretty women. Now, having been sent halfway
P05 0900  6    around the world on a job she had not asked for, Tommy
P05 0910  4    was being humiliated at every turn.
P05 0910 10       She looked around, self-consciously. Four little
P05 0920  6    Japanese waitresses were murdering the English language
P05 0930  4    at the counter- Yuki Kobayashi happened to be one of
P05 0940  5    them. Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming
P05 0950  1    when they called, "Bifutek-san"! for a steak sandwich,
P05 0950 10    or "Kohi futotsu"! for one cup of coffee. Two other
P05 0960 10    Japanese girls were sitting at the tables, both quite
P05 0970  8    pretty and well groomed. One was with a whitehaired
P05 0980  5    and doting lieutenant commander; the other was with
P05 0990  3    her American husband and their exceptionally appealing
P05 0990 10    children. Seeing these did nothing for Tommy's mood.
P05 1000  8    She told herself rebelliously, and with pride, I am
P05 1010  7    an American!
P05 1010  9       And so she was, and would remain. But she was learning
P05 1020 11    that so long as she was in this country, and wore civilian
P05 1030  8    dress in the Club, there would always be transient
P05 1040  4    young men who would approach her with broken English.
P05 1050  1    There had been occasions when some of the more experienced
P05 1050 11    had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly
P05 1060 10    good Japanese. Tommy wouldn't know; after coming to
P05 1070  7    America, her parents had spoken only English.
P05 1080  3       One thing was becoming increasingly sure. She had
P05 1090  3    been sent to the wrong place for duty. There was more
P05 1090 14    to service in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in
P05 1100 10    the ward. One had to have friends, and a congenial
P05 1110  7    life in after-duty hours ...
P05 1120  1       Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet
P05 1120 10    Bar. It was terribly off key, and poorly done, and
P05 1130  7    Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship
P05 1140  4    was a very natural and important thing, but all at
P05 1150  2    once she felt lonesome and put-upon. She finished her
P05 1150 12    hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check;
P05 1160  9    she got out of the coffee shop before the incident
P05 1170  5    could be repeated. Eating while angry had given her
P05 1180  2    a slight indigestion. Back in her living quarters at
P05 1180 11    the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda, and sulked.
P05 1190  8       Then, after a while, she went to her mirror. It
P05 1200  7    was all true. She certainly looked Japanese, and perhaps
P05 1210  4    she could not really blame the young men. And, still,
P05 1220  2    they did not have to be so crude in their approach
P05 1220 13    ...
P05 1230  1       There was a letter to write to her mother, and she
P05 1230 11    tried to make its tone cheerful. She promised that
P05 1240  6    she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the
P05 1250  4    uncle she had never seen, on the island of Oyajima-
P05 1260  3    which was not very far from Yokusuka. And tomorrow
P05 1260 12    she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother
P05 1270  9    wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member
P05 1280  6    as a hostess gown.
P05 1280 10       Tommy, of course, had never heard of a kotowaza,
P05 1290  7    or Japanese proverb, which says, "Tanin yori miuchi",
P05 1300  3    and is literally translated as "Relatives are better
P05 1310  2    than strangers".
P05 1310  4       Actually, this is only another way of saying that
P05 1320  4    blood is thicker than water.
P05 1320  9    #II#
P05 1320 10    Doc Doolittle's scheduled appearance at captain's mast
P05 1330  6    was a very unusual thing, because the discipline dispensed
P05 1340  5    there is ordinarily for the young and immature, and
P05 1360  4    a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report.
P05 1370  1    But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual, too,
P05 1370 12    and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had started it
P05 1380  8    through some expert tactics in rabble rousing. Just
P05 1390  5    why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive
P05 1400  2    officer didn't know. In his opinion, Doc had not grown
P05 1410  1    up.
P05 1410  2       The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief.
P05 1410 11    There had never been a good reason for Doc Doolittle
P05 1420 10    to grow up. He had come into the Navy too young, with
P05 1430  8    the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him.
P05 1440  4    The war found him much too early, and its perils- and
P05 1450  4    especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in
P05 1450 12    horseplay and elaborate practical jokes, and even now
P05 1460  8    Doc had never found any stabilizing, sobering influence.
P05 1470  5    He remained young at heart, with an overdeveloped sense
P05 1480  4    of humor. He wisecracked about the captain's indoctrination
P05 1490  2    of new men, took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches
P05 1500  1    with ethyl chloride, and gave no thought for tomorrow.
P05 1500 10    He was doing thirty years, and the Navy would take
P05 1510  8    care of him. The job security enjoyed by Doc Doolittle,
P05 1520  5    and nearly all members of the Armed Forces, is a wonderful
P05 1530  5    thing. Actually, all a man in uniform has to do is
P05 1540  3    to get by. He may not rise to the heights, but he can
P05 1540 16    get by, and eventually be retired.
P05 1550  4       Doc had been under restriction to the ship since
P05 1560  3    the Bustard left Subic. This deprived him of liberty
P05 1570  1    in Hong Kong, but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong
P05 1570 11    Kong was a book he had read before, and the Navy would
P05 1580 11    always bring him there again, some day. At Yokosuka
P05 1590  6    he was restricted to the confines of the Base because
P05 1600  4    Walt Perry, being thoughtful, knew that Doc might have
P05 1610  2    to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or
P05 1610 11    the Supply Base. This gave Doc the whole range of the
P05 1620 10    naval establishment, and suited him quite well. There
P05 1630  6    were two things he wanted to do: inspect one of the
P05 1640  4    many caves that had been dug into the hills on the
P05 1640 15    Naval Base, and visit an old shipmate.
P05 1650  7       A telephone line had been hooked up to connect the
P05 1660  6    ship with the Base exchange. After supper, Doc called
P05 1670  3    Whitey Gresham, who was now a lieutenant and had a
P05 1670 13    family.
P05 1680  1       "Well, Doc, you old sonofabitch"! Whitey exclaimed,
P05 1690  1    with true affection. "Come over and have a drink. We
P05 1690 11    live down by the Base commissary. Grab a taxi".
P05 1700  7       "I'll be there, but I'll walk", Doc said. "I've
P05 1710  6    got to run an errand on the way. See you in about an
P05 1720  7    hour".
P05 1720  8       He threw a smart salute at the gangway, went up
P05 1730  5    the dock, and turned down the wide street in front
P05 1740  1    of the Petty Officers' Club.
