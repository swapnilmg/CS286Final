F38 0010  1    Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the
F38 0010 13    city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms;
F38 0020  7    and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering
F38 0030  4    all morning, until the edges of the field were packed
F38 0040  3    thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing
F38 0040 13    field to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was
F38 0050 10    a formidable looking young man with the only baseball
F38 0060  7    cap.
F38 0060  8       This was a bitterly fought game, carrying almost
F38 0070  5    as much grudge as a fist fight, with no friendliness
F38 0080  2    exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness
F38 0090  1    that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules
F38 0090  9    and agreements on balls that went into the crowd. Every
F38 0100  7    pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured
F38 0110  6    audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped (and
F38 0120  3    because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy
F38 0120 12    from drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of
F38 0130  9    derision.
F38 0130 10       At one point in the game when the skinny old man
F38 0140 11    in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way
F38 0150  7    of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys,
F38 0160  3    he lay there unattended while players and spectators
F38 0160 11    wrangled over whether the ball was "dead" or the base
F38 0170 10    runners were free to score.
F38 0180  4       This was typical of such games, which were earnestly
F38 0190  1    played to win and practically never wound up in an
F38 0190 11    expression of good fellowship. When the visitors, after
F38 0200  7    losing this game, rode along the village streets toward
F38 0210  5    home, the youngsters who could keep abreast of them
F38 0220  3    for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch
F38 0220 12    of hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!
F38 0240  1       Baseball was surely the national game in those days,
F38 0240  9    even though professional baseball may have been merely
F38 0250  6    a business. Radio broadcasts had not begun and most
F38 0260  5    devotees of baseball attended the games near home,
F38 0270  1    in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or
F38 0270 12    three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs
F38 0280  8    or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox.
F38 0290  4       Young men in school could look forward to playing
F38 0300  1    ball for money in a dozen different places, even if
F38 0300 11    they failed to make the major leagues. Nearly any lad
F38 0310  8    with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting
F38 0320  5    him in the Three I League, or the Pony League, or
F38 0330  3    the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League,
F38 0340  1    if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues
F38 0340 12    that abounded everywhere. Even a city of thirty thousand
F38 0350  7    might have six baseball teams, sponsored by grocers
F38 0360  4    and hardware merchants or department stores, that played
F38 0370  3    two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually
F38 0370 13    in the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan
F38 0380 11    audience who did not begrudge a quarter each, or even
F38 0390  9    more, to be dropped into a hat when the game was half
F38 0400  6    over.
F38 0400  7       Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's hero, and everyone
F38 0410  4    knew him, even though relatively few ever saw him play
F38 0420  4    ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes
F38 0430  1    in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As
F38 0430 11    the twenties grew older, and as radio broadcasts of
F38 0440  7    baseball games began to involve more and more people
F38 0450  4    daily in the doings of the professionals, the great
F38 0460  1    hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the
F38 0460  9    game so that pitchers were nearly of no account. Boys
F38 0470  7    no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school
F38 0480  5    kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie Keeler
F38 0490  2    and the famous hitters of another day had done.
F38 0490 11       Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in
F38 0500  9    the news and a few even dared to dream of matching
F38 0510  5    Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his friends,
F38 0520  2    or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him
F38 0520 14    (Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least)
F38 0530 12    and who called most of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig
F38 0540  7    was given the nickname Buster, and he ran Ruth a close
F38 0550  7    race in home runs. But the nickname never stuck and
F38 0560  3    Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes
F38 0570  1    a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the
F38 0570 11    field. Ruth was a delinquent boy still, but he was
F38 0580  9    in every way a great ball player who was out to win
F38 0590  7    the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to
F38 0600  2    do it.
F38 0600  4       A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities,
F38 0610  1    with the encouragement of the press, so that they might
F38 0620  1    see their names in big black print, along with Daddy
F38 0620 11    Browning's, Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince
F38 0630  8    of Wales'. One who, for a time, succeeded best and
F38 0640  3    was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires,
F38 0650  3    who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the Great,
F38 0660  2    or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could
F38 0660 13    beat everybody at anything, but especially at fighting,
F38 0670  8    and he once took on the manager of his club and worked
F38 0680  8    him over thoroughly with his fists. he was given to
F38 0690  5    public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;
F38 0700  1    and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass
F38 0700 12    knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion
F38 0710  9    to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten
F38 0720  5    reason. (This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder
F38 0730  3    in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated
F38 0740  1    his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man,
F38 0740 10    who was barely of age when he broke into major-league
F38 0750  9    baseball, was that he really was a better ball player
F38 0760  6    than he was given credit for being- never so good as
F38 0770  3    he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates,
F38 0770 12    but a good steady performer when he could fight down
F38 0780  9    the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in
F38 0790  8    public.
F38 0790  9       In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps
F38 0800  5    more typical of his era than Ruth was, for he was but
F38 0810  4    one of many young men who laid waste their talents
F38 0810 14    in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning
F38 0820  9    space in the newspapers. There were others who climbed
F38 0830  6    flagpoles and refused to come down; or who ingested
F38 0840  4    strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook to
F38 0850  2    set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with
F38 0850 12    or without a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles
F38 0860 10    of illicit gin without pausing for breath. One young
F38 0870  6    man, exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor
F38 0880  3    and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect
F38 0890  1    swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during
F38 0890 12    the Yale-Army football game, landed squarely on his
F38 0900  7    head on the concrete ramp below, and died at once.
F38 0910  5       But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving
F38 0920  3    after recognition. The business of baseball began to
F38 0920 11    prosper along with other entertainments, and performers-
F38 0930  7    thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts
F38 0940  6    each season to run his salary higher and higher- prospered
F38 0950  6    too. While fifty years before, Albert Goodwill Spalding,
F38 0960  4    secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National
F38 0970  3    League, could write earnestly to the manager of the
F38 0970 12    Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred
F38 0980  9    dollars for a baseball game in August, in this Golden
F38 0990  7    Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly
F38 1000  5    a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And while less
F38 1010  3    than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of
F38 1010 13    them top performers in their positions- had toiled
F38 1020  8    for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from
F38 1030  6    twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars
F38 1040  3    a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars,
F38 1050  1    twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars
F38 1050  9    a season.
F38 1060  1       The greatest team of this period was unquestionably
F38 1060  9    the New York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and
F38 1070  8    made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller
F38 1080  8    Huggins. Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some
F38 1090  5    wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great
F38 1100  2    1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to
F38 1100 13    millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could
F38 1110  9    not deny them their most trifling desire. Ruth himself,
F38 1120  5    still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest
F38 1130  4    in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his
F38 1140  2    round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade
F38 1140 12    down from Fenway Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays,
F38 1150  7    Leslie "Joe" Bush, Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam
F38 1160  7    Jones, catcher Wally Schang, third baseman Joe Dugan
F38 1170  5    (who completed the "playboy trio" of Ruth, Dugan, and
F38 1180  4    Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when the
F38 1190  2    mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of
F38 1190 12    these were left but they still shone brightest, even
F38 1200  8    beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri (who
F38 1210  5    managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on
F38 1220  3    the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras,
F38 1220 11    and gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team,
F38 1230 10    through two seasons and in the two World's Series that
F38 1240  8    followed, have been written and talked about until
F38 1250  5    hardly a word is left to be said. But there is one
F38 1260  3    small episode that a few New York fans who happened
F38 1260 13    to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game
F38 1270  9    in 1926 like best to recall. Babe Ruth, as he always
F38 1280  7    did in the Stadium, played right field to avoid having
F38 1290  4    the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather mediocre
F38 1300  2    hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals,
F38 1310  1    knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle
F38 1310 12    formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers,
F38 1320  7    where Ruth could not reach it. The ball lay there,
F38 1330  6    shining white on the grass in view of nearly every
F38 1340  2    fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration,
F38 1340 12    charged about the small patch of ground screaming,
F38 1350  8    "Where's the -ing ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily
F38 1360  7    when the inning was over, "not a sonofabitch in the
F38 1370  6    place would tell me", so little Tommy ran all the way
F38 1380  5    home.
F38 1380  6       The ordinary man and woman, however, saw little
F38 1390  2    of the great professional games of those Golden Days,
F38 1390 11    or of any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters
F38 1400  9    always hastened to place their choice tickets in the
F38 1410  8    hands of the wealthy speculators, and only the man
F38 1420  5    who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in
F38 1430  1    with the guy at the box office ever came up with a
F38 1430 13    good seat for a contest of any importance. Radio broadcasts,
F38 1440  6    however- now that even plain people could afford "loud
F38 1450  5    speakers" on their sets- held old fans to the major-league
F38 1460  6    races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, who through
F38 1470  3    what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality
F38 1470 10    of audition, became first inured, then attracted, then
F38 1480  7    addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings
F38 1490  6    in some distant baseball park.
F38 1500  1       In some cities games were broadcast throughout the
F38 1500  9    week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced,
F38 1510  6    and fans must needs drive to the city from all the
F38 1520  5    broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.
F38 1530  1    This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts
F38 1530 11    as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies,
F38 1540 11    some of which began to offer special excursion rates,
F38 1550  6    including seats at the park, just as the trolley and
F38 1560  5    ferry companies had when baseball was new.
F38 1570  1       While women had always attended ball games in small
F38 1570 10    numbers (it was the part of a "dead game sport" in
F38 1580  8    the early years of the twentieth century to be taken
F38 1590  5    out to the ball park and to root, root, root for the
F38 1600  2    home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom,
F38 1600 11    unable even to read the scoreboard, which sometimes
F38 1610  6    seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score
F38 1630  6    of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one.
F38 1640  3    The questions women asked at baseball games were standard
F38 1650  1    grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women
F38 1650 11    automobile drivers; for every grown man (except a few
F38 1660  8    who were always suspected of being shy on virility)
F38 1670  5    knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just as
F38 1680  2    every male American in this era liked to imagine (or
F38 1680 12    pretend) that he could fight with his fists. And women
F38 1690  9    were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying
F38 1700  6    not to let the batter hit the ball.
F38 1710  1       Radio, however, so increased the interest of women
F38 1710  9    in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have
F38 1720  9    "Ladies' Days" any longer to enable men to get to the
F38 1730  8    ball park without interference at home. Women actually
F38 1740  3    began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where
F38 1750  1    they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home
F38 1750 10    with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new
F38 1760  9    curse word tingling their ears.
F38 1770  1       The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently
F38 1770  9    informative, despite the baseball jargon, that girls
F38 1780  7    and women could begin to store up in their minds the
F38 1790  7    same sort of random and meaningless statistics that
F38 1800  2    small boys had long learned better than they ever did
F38 1800 12    their lessons in school.
