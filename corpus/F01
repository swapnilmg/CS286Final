F01 0010  1       In American romance, almost nothing rates higher
F01 0010  8    than what the movie men have called "meeting cute"-
F01 0020  7    that is, boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't
F01 0030  7    take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom.
F01 0040  4    Just about the most enthralling real-life example of
F01 0050  2    meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga:
F01 0060  1    reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts,
F01 0060 12    but he said simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds".
F01 0070  7    Aside from the comico-romantico content here, a good
F01 0080  5    linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few
F01 0090  5    other facts, especially if he had a little more of
F01 0090 15    the conversation to go on.
F01 0100  5       The way MacArthur said his line- if you had the
F01 0110  4    recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would
F01 0120  1    probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses
F01 0120  9    on emeralds and wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on
F01 0130  8    emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl, one degree
F01 0140  5    of oversoftness ... Conclusions: The people involved
F01 0150  2    (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly
F01 0150 11    the relative values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary
F01 0160  8    and sentimental. And the drawling, oversoft voice of
F01 0170  7    flirtation, though fairly overt, was still well within
F01 0180  5    the prescribed gambit of their culture.
F01 0190  1       In other words, like automation machines designed
F01 0190  7    to work in tandem, they shared the same programming,
F01 0200  5    a mutual understanding not only of English words, but
F01 0210  3    of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can
F01 0220  1    change their meaning from black to white. At this point,
F01 0220 11    unfortunately, romance becomes a regrettably small
F01 0230  6    part of the picture; but consider, if you can bear
F01 0240  5    it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for some
F01 0250  2    perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark
F01 0250 10    to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds
F01 0260  9    would have been just so much blubber. The point- quite
F01 0270  7    simply- is this: words they might have had; but communication,
F01 0280  6    no.
F01 0280  7       This basic principle, the first in a richly knotted
F01 0290  7    bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith,
F01 0300  3    Jr., at the University of Buffalo, where he heads the
F01 0310  2    world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.
F01 0310  9    A brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an
F01 0320  8    ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same
F01 0330  7    peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith began his academic
F01 0340  4    career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project
F01 0350  1    considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording
F01 0350  9    about "a young rat named Arthur, who never could make
F01 0360  8    up his mind". Later, he became one of the central spirits
F01 0370  7    of the Army Language Program and the language school
F01 0380  4    of Washington's Foreign Service Institute. It was there,
F01 0390  4    in the course of trying to prepare new men for the
F01 0390 15    "culture shock" they might encounter in remote overseas
F01 0400  8    posts, that he first began to develop a system of charting
F01 0410  9    the "norms of human communication".
F01 0420  1       To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always
F01 0430  1    revealed a staggering quantity of information about
F01 0430  8    the talker- such things as geographical origin and/or
F01 0440  7    history, socio-economic identity, education. It is
F01 0450  4    only fairly recently, however, that linguists have
F01 0460  2    developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper
F01 0460 11    in a way that tells even more about the speakers and
F01 0470  9    about the success or failure of human communication
F01 0480  4    between two people. This, for obvious reasons, makes
F01 0490  2    their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric
F01 0500  1    interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been
F01 0500 10    successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis
F01 0510  7    and to evaluate the progress of therapy.
F01 0520  1       In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished
F01 0530  1    colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he
F01 0530  8    sometimes fights his own evident charm), and a third
F01 0540  9    man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed
F01 0550  5    on some basic premises about the three-part process
F01 0560  2    that makes communication: (1) words or language (2)
F01 0560 10    paralanguage, a set of phenomena including laughing,
F01 0570  7    weeping, voice breaks, and "tone" of voice, and (3)
F01 0580  7    kinesics, the technical name for gestures, facial expressions,
F01 0590  4    and body shifts- nodding or shaking the head, "talking"
F01 0600  3    with one's hands, et cetera.
F01 0600  8       Smith's first workout with stresses, pitches, and
F01 0610  7    junctures was based on mother, which spells, in our
F01 0620  5    culture, a good deal more than bread alone. For example,
F01 0630  3    if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there
F01 0630 12    are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate
F01 0640  8    for addressing your mother. The usual U.S. norm would
F01 0650  6    be: **f Middle pitches, slight pause (juncture) before
F01 0660  4    mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols of mother's
F01 0670  3    status, here, are all usual for culture U.S.A. Quite
F01 0680  2    other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note
F01 0680 11    the drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no
F01 0690 11    rise at the end of the sentence; this is a "fade" ending,
F01 0700  7    and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech,
F01 0710  5    expressing something less than conventional respect
F01 0720  2    for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple
F01 0720 12    pie goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker
F01 0730 11    relates to mother is clearly indicated. And while the
F01 0740  7    meaning of the words is not in this instance altered,
F01 0750  4    the quality of communication in both the second and
F01 0760  2    third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying
F01 0760  9    record of paralanguage factors for the second example
F01 0770  8    might also note a throaty rasp. With this seven-word
F01 0790  6    sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he
F01 0800  3    was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling
F01 0810  1    things about himself and, in the last two examples,
F01 0810 10    revealing that he had departed from the customs of
F01 0820  8    his culture.
F01 0820 10       The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry
F01 0830  5    have established, in point of fact, that no matter
F01 0840  6    what the subject of conversation is or what words are
F01 0850  2    involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all
F01 0850 12    without telling over and over again what sort of people
F01 0860  9    they are and how they relate to the rest of the world.
F01 0870  7    Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic
F01 0880  3    instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of interviews
F01 0890  2    for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone
F01 0890 12    proportions in new research and training. Some of the
F01 0900  9    earliest recordings, made in the 1940's, demonstrated
F01 0910  6    that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and
F01 0920  4    anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records
F01 0930  1    of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy
F01 0930 11    which- if they were at all discernible in print- were
F01 0940  9    picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts.
F01 0950  5    In a general way, psychiatrists were able to establish
F01 0960  4    on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-
F01 0970  3    that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic,
F01 0970 12    that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted
F01 0980  8    by sound alone and not necessarily by words.
F01 0990  4       At a minimum, recording- usually on tape, which
F01 1000  2    is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric
F01 1000 11    interview alive so that the full range of emotion and
F01 1010 10    meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist
F01 1020  5    or by a battery of therapists. Newest to this high-powered
F01 1030  5    battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried
F01 1040  2    that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic
F01 1040 12    analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews,
F01 1050  9    they have supplied a new set of techniques for the
F01 1060  8    therapist. Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview
F01 1070  4    flags points where the patient's voice departs from
F01 1080  2    expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of
F01 1080 10    communication as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval,
F01 1090  8    ambivalence or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and
F01 1100  6    the disinclination to speak at all- this last often
F01 1110  4    marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.
F01 1120  1       Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the
F01 1120  8    therapist, but orientation- not only the patient's
F01 1130  5    vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic
F01 1140  4    background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways
F01 1150  1    of danger spots in his relationship to people- can
F01 1150 10    be considerably beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric
F01 1160  8    chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas
F01 1170  5    where deeper probing may bring to light underlying
F01 1180  1    psychological difficulties, making them apparent first
F01 1180  7    to the therapist and eventually to the patient. In
F01 1190  8    one now-historic first interview, for example, the
F01 1210  4    transcript (reproduced from the book, The First Five
F01 1220  3    Minutes) goes like this: **f The therapist's level
F01 1230  1    tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided
F01 1230 11    stressing "you", which would imply disapproval; or
F01 1240  7    surprise, which would set the patient apart from other
F01 1250  7    people. The patient, on the other hand, is far from
F01 1260  5    neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent,
F01 1270  1    she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense,
F01 1270 11    depressed", a certain pedantic itemization that indicates
F01 1280  7    she has some familiarity with literary or scientific
F01 1290  5    language (i.e., she must have had at least a high-school
F01 1300  7    education), and she is telling a story she has mentally
F01 1310  3    rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into
F01 1310 11    "everything and everybody", putting particular violence
F01 1320  6    on "everybody", indicating to the linguist that this
F01 1330  7    is a spot to flag- that is, it is not congruent to
F01 1340  7    the patient's general style of speech up to this point.
F01 1350  4    Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.
F01 1360  1    He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is
F01 1360 10    probably not the true target of her resentment. Immediately
F01 1370  9    thereafter, the patient fractures her rehearsed story,
F01 1380  6    veering into an oversoft, breathy, sloppily articulated,
F01 1390  3    "I don't feel like talking right now".
F01 1400  1       Within the first five minutes of this interview
F01 1400  9    it is apparent to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully
F01 1410  7    refers to the woman's husband. She says later, but
F01 1420  6    still within the opening five minutes, "I keep thinking
F01 1430  4    of a divorce but that's another emotional death".
F01 1440  1       The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery
F01 1440  8    are all present in the voice chart for this sentence;
F01 1450 10    so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce.
F01 1460  8    By saying "another emotional death", she reveals that
F01 1470  5    there has been a previous one, although she has not
F01 1480  4    described it in words. This the therapist may pursue
F01 1481  1    in later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death",
F01 1490  7    interesting and, to a non-scientific mind, rather touching,
F01 1500  8    suggests that this woman may have some flair for words,
F01 1510  7    perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably
F01 1520  2    called "creative".
F01 1520  4       Since the psychiatric interview, like any other
F01 1530  4    interview, depends on communication, it is significant
F01 1540  1    to note that the therapist in this interview was a
F01 1540 11    man of marked skill and long experience. His own communication
F01 1550  8    apparatus operated superbly, and Lillian Ross readers
F01 1560  6    will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to
F01 1570  5    the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr.
F01 1580  2    Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of
F01 1580  8    the real-life therapists involved could conceivably
F01 1590  5    compare with Blauberman- when groups of them began
F01 1600  8    playing back interviews, they discovered any number
F01 1610  3    of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview
F01 1620  1    techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of
F01 1620  9    his own sessions on tape, expressed some desire to
F01 1630  7    take the whole thing over again.
F01 1640  1       Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped
F01 1640 11    interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists
F01 1650  7    laid bare the surprising fact that, in the first five
F01 1660  6    minutes of an initial interview, the patient often
F01 1670  2    reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong
F01 1670 12    with him; to spot these giveaways the therapist must
F01 1680  8    know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen.
F01 1690  6    Naturally, the patient does not say, "I hate my father",
F01 1700  5    or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me". What he does
F01 1701  4    do is give himself away by communicating information
F01 1710  8    over and above the words involved. Some of the classic
F01 1720 10    indicators, as described by Drs. Pittenger, Hockett,
F01 1730  5    and Danehy in The First Five Minutes, are these:
F01 1740  5    _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_
F01 1740  8       Stammering or repetition of I, you, he, she, et
F01 1750  9    cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty. On the
F01 1770  5    other hand significant facts may be concealed- she
F01 1780  4    may mean I; or everybody, as it did with the tense
F01 1790  1    and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to
F01 1790  9    a specific person. The word that is not used can be
F01 1800  9    as important as the word that is used; therapist and/or
F01 1810  5    linguist must always consider the alternatives. When
F01 1820  2    someone says, for example, "They took X rays to see
F01 1830  2    that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider
F01 1830 13    how this statement would normally be made. (This patient,
F01 1840  9    in actuality, was a neurasthenic who had almost come
F01 1850  8    to the point of accepting the fact that it was not
F01 1870  5    her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.)
F01 1880  1    ... Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in
F01 1880  9    Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke
F01 1890  7    of his wife, which is hardly surprising in view of
F01 1900  7    their disastrous relationship.
