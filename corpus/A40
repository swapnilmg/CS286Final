A40 0010  1       Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's
A40 0020  1    Convair, the Caroline, winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra
A40 0030  1    and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford,
A40 0030  9    Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law. Also included in the
A40 0040  9    entourage: a dog in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter
A40 0050  8    had an urgent mission: to stage a mammoth Inauguration
A40 0060  4    Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard
A40 0070  3    Armory. Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as he
A40 0080  2    had hinted upon his arrival: "It's really tremendous
A40 0080 10    when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia.
A40 0090  8    I could talk to you for three hours and still not be
A40 0100  9    able to give you all of our plans"! As the plans were
A40 0110  5    laid, some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced
A40 0120  3    in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes
A40 0120 13    priced at $10,000 each. The biggest single act would
A40 0130  9    doubtless be staged by Frankie himself: his Inaugural
A40 0140  6    wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don
A40 0150  4    Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles. Soon
A40 0160  2    after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered
A40 0170  1    "two of everything" just "in case he spills anything",
A40 0170 10    Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed
A40 0180 11    he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing. @

A40 0190  6    A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior
A40 0200  4    to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps, General
A40 0210  2    David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in
A40 0220  2    the form of a "happy, warless New Year" greeting to
A40 0220 12    his Pentagon staff. Said Leatherneck Shoup: "A year
A40 0230  8    ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands. After
A40 0240  9    pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the
A40 0250  5    moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and found
A40 0260  2    hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a
A40 0260 13    rein on. Little geeing and hawing have been necessary".
A40 0270  7    But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots. Speaking
A40 0280  8    of "pride", he deplored the noncommissioned officer
A40 0290  4    "whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who
A40 0300  3    retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks
A40 0300 12    or the bay window. A few of these people are still
A40 0310 11    around". @

A40 0690  7    One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers,
A40 0700  5    the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia, enterprisingly interviewed
A40 0710  5    Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa,
A40 0720  7    where he has been in self-exile since 1952. Chaplin,
A40 0730  6    71, who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England
A40 0740  3    in 1956, confided that he hopes to visit Russia some
A40 0750  2    time this summer because "I have marveled at your grandiose
A40 0750 12    experiment and I believe in your future". Then Charlie
A40 0760  9    spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he
A40 0770  8    had glimpsed: "I was captivated by his humor, frankness
A40 0780  5    and good nature and by his kind, strong and somewhat
A40 0790  3    sly face".
A40 0800  1       G. David Thompson is one of those names known to
A40 0800 11    the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen
A40 0810  7    in Europe's best hotels, but he is somewhat of an enigma
A40 0820  8    to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh.
A40 0830  3    There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth, a
A40 0840  1    reputation for eccentricity, and an ardor for collecting
A40 0840  9    art. Last week, in the German city of Du^sseldorf,
A40 0850  7    G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well
A40 0860  6    give Pittsburgh pause. On display were 343 first-class
A40 0870  4    paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-
A40 0880  3    and every single one of them was up for sale.
A40 0880 13       Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who
A40 0890  7    kept his own great collection closed to the general
A40 0900  5    public (TIME, Jan. 2), Thompson, at 61, is something
A40 0910  5    of a legend in his own lifetime. He made his fortune
A40 0920  2    during World War II when he took over a number of
A40 0920 13    dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.
A40 0930 10    Even before he hit big money, he had begun buying modern
A40 0940  8    paintings. He gave the impression of never having read
A40 0950  5    a word about art, but there was no doubt that he had
A40 0960  3    an eye for the best.
A40 0960  8       He was able to smell a bargain- and a masterpiece-
A40 0970  4    a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred
A40 0980  2    Barr said of him: "I have never mentioned a new artist
A40 0990  1    that Thompson didn't know about". He might barge into
A40 0990 10    a gallery, start haggling over prices without so much
A40 1000  8    as a word of greeting. He could be lavishly generous
A40 1010  6    with friends, cab drivers and bellboys, but with dealers
A40 1020  4    he was tough. He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses,
A40 1030  1    Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti
A40 1040  1    sculptures. He gathered one of the biggest collections
A40 1040  9    of Paul Klees in the world. All these he hung in his
A40 1050 10    burglarproof home called Stone's Throw, outside Pittsburgh,
A40 1060  4    and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see
A40 1070  5    them.
A40 1070  6       Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to
A40 1080  3    the city. But he insisted that it be housed in a special
A40 1090  1    museum. Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh
A40 1090  9    society had been snubbing him for years. He went then
A40 1100  9    to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler,
A40 1110  5    with whom he had long been trading pictures. Last year
A40 1120  3    Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees
A40 1130  1    to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will
A40 1130 10    house them in a museum that is yet to be built. Last
A40 1140 10    week most of the other prizes, once offered to Pittsburgh,
A40 1150  5    went on the block.
A40 1150  9       At the opening of the Du^sseldorf show, Thompson
A40 1160  6    himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was
A40 1170  5    seeing together for the last time. In fact he seemed
A40 1180  2    delighted to get rid of them. Some observers speculated
A40 1180 11    that this might be his revenge on his home town. Thompson
A40 1190 11    himself said: "I want to enjoy once more the pleasure
A40 1200  9    of bare walls waiting for new pictures".
A40 1220  1    #BREAK IN GEORGIA#
A40 1220  4    The University of Georgia has long claimed that it
A40 1230  2    does not discriminate against any applicant on the
A40 1230 10    basis of race or color. But in all its 175 years, not
A40 1240 12    a single Negro student has entered its classrooms.
A40 1250  6    Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle
A40 1260  4    ordered the university to admit immediately a "qualified"
A40 1270  3    Negro boy and girl. Their entry will crack the total
A40 1280  2    segregation of all public education, from kindergarten
A40 1280  9    through graduate school, in Georgia- and in Alabama,
A40 1290  7    Mississippi and South Carolina as well.
A40 1300  4       For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and Charlayne
A40 1310  2    Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university. They
A40 1310 12    graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School,
A40 1320  7    where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and
A40 1330  8    Charlayne third. The university rejected them on a
A40 1340  5    variety of pretexts, but was careful never to mention
A40 1350  3    the color of their skins. Holmes went to Atlanta's
A40 1350 12    Morehouse (Negro) College, where he is a B+ student
A40 1360  9    and star halfback. Charlayne studied journalism at
A40 1370  5    Detroit's Wayne State University. Last fall, after
A40 1380  4    they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court,
A40 1390  2    Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.
A40 1390  9       Charlayne was "tentatively" admitted for next fall,
A40 1400  7    after state investigators questioned her white roommate
A40 1410  5    at Wayne State. But Holmes was rejected again "on the
A40 1420  4    basis of his record and interview". The evidence in
A40 1430  2    court was testimony about the interview, which for
A40 1430 10    Holmes lasted an hour, although at least one white
A40 1440  8    student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple
A40 1450  6    phone conversation. Holmes was asked if he had ever
A40 1460  3    visited a house of prostitution, or a "beatnik parlor
A40 1460 12    or teahouse". No, said he, but officials still called
A40 1470  8    him "evasive". They also said he lied in saying that
A40 1480  9    he had never been "arrested". Their reason: Holmes
A40 1490  4    once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license suspended.
A40 1500  2       Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white
A40 1510  1    students, found that many were hardly interviewed at
A40 1510  9    all- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton
A40 1520  8    Holmes. The real reason for his rejection, they argued,
A40 1530  6    is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off
A40 1540  3    funds for any desegregated school.
A40 1540  8       Judge Bootle's decision: "The two plaintiffs are
A40 1550  6    qualified for admission to said university and would
A40 1560  6    already have been admitted had it not been for their
A40 1570  3    race and color". The state will appeal- but few think
A40 1580  1    it will actually try to close the university. "Surprised
A40 1580 10    and pleased", Students Holmes and Hunter may enter
A40 1590  7    the University of Georgia this week.
A40 1595  3    #CATCH FOR CHICAGO#
A40 1595  6    When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence
A40 1600  4    A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March, a
A40 1610  7    mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway. Out went letters
A40 1620  7    to 60,000 old grads, asking for suggestions. Such academic
A40 1630  4    statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted. Two committees
A40 1640  3    pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including
A40 1650  1    Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean
A40 1650  8    McGeorge Bundy. The debate led to a decision that Chicago
A40 1660 10    needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic
A40 1670  8    administrator, but rather, as Trustee Chairman Glen
A40 1680  5    A. Lloyd put it, "a top scholar in his own right"-
A40 1690  4    a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.
A40 1700  1       Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar
A40 1700  9    in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty: dynamic Geneticist
A40 1710  8    George Wells Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel
A40 1720  8    Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how
A40 1730  4    genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry
A40 1740  2    (TIME, Cover, July 14, 1958).
A40 1740  7       It fell to Chancellor Kimpton, now a Standard Oil
A40 1750  6    (Indiana) executive, to spend his nine-year reign tidying
A40 1760  6    up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert
A40 1770  3    Maynard Hutchins. He threw out some of Hutchins' more
A40 1780  2    wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate
A40 1780  8    enrollment to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3
A40 1790  8    million. But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he
A40 1800  7    felt was working order, some old grads feel that it
A40 1810  4    still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled
A40 1810 13    it in the heady Hutchins era.
A40 1820  6       At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to
A40 1830  5    his research as head of the school's famous biology
A40 1840  1    division since 1946. But he has shown a sixth-sense
A40 1840 11    ability to spot, recruit and excite able researchers,
A40 1850  6    and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising
A40 1860  5    and speech-making. Beadle is even that rare scientist
A40 1870  1    who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads
A40 1870 11    the Wall Street Journal, and took delight in driving
A40 1880  9    a $250 model A Ford for 22 years, then selling it
A40 1890  8    for $300.
