K13 0010  1    In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened
K13 0010 10    up the room, and then they went across the hall to
K13 0020  9    the kitchen. She was intimidated by the stove. He found
K13 0030  6    the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for
K13 0040  2    her. The gas flamed up two inches high. They found
K13 0040 12    the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched
K13 0050 10    through the icebox. Several sections of a loaf of dark
K13 0060  8    bread; butter; jam; a tiny cake of ice. In their search
K13 0070  7    for what turned out to be the right breakfast china
K13 0080  2    but the wrong table silver, they opened every cupboard
K13 0080 11    door in the kitchen and pantry. While she was settling
K13 0090 10    the teacart, he went back across the hall to their
K13 0100  7    bedroom, opened one of the suitcases, and took out
K13 0110  4    powdered coffee and sugar. She appeared with the teacart
K13 0120  1    and he opened the windows.
K13 0120  6       "Do you want to call Eugene"?
K13 0130  1       He didn't, but it was not really a question, and
K13 0130 11    so he left the room, walked down the hall to the front
K13 0140 11    of the apartment, hesitated, and then knocked lightly
K13 0150  5    on the closed door of the study. A sleepy voice answered.
K13 0160  3       "Le petit dejeuner", Harold said, in an accent that
K13 0170  4    did credit to Miss Sloan, his high-school French teacher.
K13 0180  1    At the same time, his voice betrayed uncertainty about
K13 0180 10    their being here, and conveyed an appeal to whatever
K13 0190  9    is reasonable, peace-loving, and dependable in everybody.
K13 0200  5       Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was
K13 0210  3    impossible, it was at least something that they were
K13 0220  1    able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar
K13 0220 11    in it, and the plate of bread and butter, and that
K13 0230  8    Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them
K13 0240  6    handle first. Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee
K13 0250  2    into his cup and then filled it with hot water. Stirring,
K13 0250 13    he said: "I am sorry that my work prevents me from
K13 0260 11    doing anything with you today".
K13 0270  3       They assured him that they did not expect or need
K13 0280  2    to be entertained.
K13 0280  5       Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his
K13 0290  2    cup and filled it with hot water, and then, stirring,
K13 0290 12    he sat back in his chair. The chair creaked. Every
K13 0300  8    time he moved or said something, the chair creaked
K13 0310  4    again.
K13 0310  5       Eugene was not entirely silent, or openly rude-
K13 0320  4    unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing
K13 0330  2    himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly
K13 0330 10    was an act of rudeness. It went right on creaking under
K13 0340  9    his own considerable weight, and all it needed, Harold
K13 0350  6    thought, was for somebody to fling himself back in
K13 0360  3    a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it.
K13 0370  1       Through the open window they heard sounds below
K13 0370  8    in the street: cartwheels, a tired horse's plodding
K13 0380  5    step, voices. Harold indicated the photograph on the
K13 0390  4    wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was
K13 0400  1    in. Eugene told him and he promptly forgot. They passed
K13 0400 11    the marmalade, the bread, the black-market butter,
K13 0410  7    back and forth. Nothing was said about hotels or train
K13 0420  5    journeys.
K13 0420  6       Eugene offered Harold his car, to use at any time
K13 0430  7    he cared to, and when this offer was not accepted,
K13 0440  1    the armchair creaked. They all three had another cup
K13 0440 10    of coffee. Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown,
K13 0450  9    and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers
K13 0460  5    that turned up at the toes.
K13 0460 11       "Ex-cuse me", he said in Berlitz English, and got
K13 0470  9    up and left them, to bathe and dress.
K13 0480  5       The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold
K13 0490  2    out into the hall. He realized that he had no idea
K13 0490 13    where the telephone was. At that moment the bathroom
K13 0500  9    door flew open and Eugene came out, with his face lathered
K13 0510  8    for shaving, and strode down the hall, tying the sash
K13 0520  6    of his dressing gown as he went. The telephone was
K13 0530  2    in the study but the ringing came from the hall. Between
K13 0530 13    the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet
K13 0540  9    of cord, and when the conversation came to an end,
K13 0550  6    Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length
K13 0560  3    of the apartment, to his bathroom, where it rang three
K13 0570  1    more times while he was shaving and in the tub. Before
K13 0570 12    he left the apartment he knocked on their door and
K13 0580  7    asked if there was anything he could do for them. Harold
K13 0590  5    shook his head.
K13 0590  8       "Sabine called a few minutes ago", Eugene said.
K13 0600  5    "She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her
K13 0610  4    tomorrow night".
K13 0610  6       He handed Harold a key to the front door, and cautioned
K13 0620  6    him against leaving it unlocked while they were out
K13 0630  4    of the apartment.
K13 0630  7       When enough time had elapsed so that there was little
K13 0640  5    likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten,
K13 0650  2    Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into
K13 0650 12    one room after another. In the room next to theirs
K13 0660 10    was a huge cradle, of mahogany, ornately carved and
K13 0670  5    decorated with gold leaf. It was the most important-looking
K13 0680  4    cradle he had ever seen. Then came their bathroom,
K13 0690  1    and then a bedroom that, judging by the photographs
K13 0690 10    on the walls, must belong to Mme Cestre. A young woman
K13 0700  9    who looked like Alix, with her two children. Alix and
K13 0710  7    Eugene on their wedding day. Matching photographs in
K13 0720  3    oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who
K13 0730  2    must be Alix's grandfather. Mme Vienot, considerably
K13 0730  9    younger and very different. The schoolboy. And a gray-haired
K13 0740 10    man whose glance- direct, lifelike, and mildly accusing-
K13 0750  6    was contradicted by the gilt and black frame. It was
K13 0760  8    the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph
K13 0770  4    of a dead person. Professor Cestre, could it be?
K13 0780  2       With the metal shutters closed, the dining room
K13 0780 10    was so dark that it seemed still night in there. One
K13 0790  9    of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he
K13 0800  6    made out the shapes of chairs and sofas, which seemed
K13 0810  2    to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet. The curtains
K13 0820  1    were of the same material, and there were some big
K13 0820 11    oil paintings- portraits in the style of Lancret and
K13 0830  7    Boucher.
K13 0830  8       Though, taken individually, the big rooms were,
K13 0840  6    or seemed to be, square, the apartment as a whole formed
K13 0850  5    a triangle. The apex, the study where Eugene slept,
K13 0860  1    was light and bright and airy and cheerful. The window
K13 0860 11    looked out on the Place Redoute- it was the only window
K13 0870 10    of the apartment that did. Looking around slowly, he
K13 0880  6    saw a marble fireplace, a desk, a low bookcase of mahogany
K13 0890  4    with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes
K13 0900  2    in the doors. The daybed Eugene had slept in, made
K13 0900 12    up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows.
K13 0910  8    The portable record player with a pile of classical
K13 0920  6    records beside it. Beethoven's Fifth was the one on
K13 0930  4    top. Da-da-da-dum ... Music could not be Eugene's passion.
K13 0940  1    Besides, the records were dusty. He tried the doors
K13 0940 10    of the bookcase. Locked. The titles he could read easily
K13 0950  8    through the criss-crossed wires: works on theology,
K13 0960  5    astral physics, history, biology, political science.
K13 0970  2    No poetry. No novels. He moved over to the desk and
K13 0980  1    stood looking at the papers on it but not touching
K13 0980 11    anything. The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized
K13 0990  7    and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his
K13 1000  5    shoulder and then quickly left the room.
K13 1000 12    #@#
K13 1010  1    THE CONCIERGE CALLED OUT to them as they were passing
K13 1010 11    through the foyer. Her quarters were on the right as
K13 1020  8    you walked into the building, and her small front room
K13 1030  5    was clogged with heavy furniture- a big, round, oak
K13 1040  2    dining table and chairs, a buffet, with a row of unclaimed
K13 1040 13    letters inserted between the mirror and its frame.
K13 1050  8    The suitcases had come while they were out, and had
K13 1060  7    been put in their room, the concierge said.
K13 1070  1       He waited until they were inside the elevator and
K13 1070 10    then said: "Now what do we do"?
K13 1080  6       "Call the Vouillemont, I guess".
K13 1090  2       "I guess".
K13 1090  4       Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases
K13 1100  4    to be delivered, they had gone sight-seeing. They went
K13 1110  2    to the Flea Market, expecting to find the treasures
K13 1110 11    of Europe, and found instead a duplication of that
K13 1120  8    long double row of booths in Tours. Cheap clothing
K13 1130  4    and junk of every sort, as far as the eye could see.
K13 1140  2    They looked, even so. Looked at everything. Barbara
K13 1140 10    bought some cotton aprons, and Harold bought shoestrings.
K13 1150  8    They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection
K13 1160  8    of two broad, busy, unpicturesque streets, and coming
K13 1170  5    home they got lost in the Metro; it took them over
K13 1180  5    an hour to get back to the station where they should
K13 1190  1    have changed, in order to take the line that went to
K13 1190 12    the Place Redoute. It was the end of the afternoon
K13 1200  8    when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted
K13 1210  5    it into the keyhole. When he opened the door, there
K13 1220  2    stood Eugene, on his way out of the apartment. He was
K13 1220 13    wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt,
K13 1230  9    and in his hand he carried a little black bag. He did
K13 1240  7    not explain where he was going, and they did not ask.
K13 1250  5    Instead, they went on down the hall to their room.
K13 1260  1       "Do you think he could be having an affair"? Barbara
K13 1260 11    asked, as they heard the front door close.
K13 1270  8       "Oh no", Harold said, shocked.
K13 1280  3       "Well, this is France, after all".
K13 1290  1       "I know, but there must be some other explanation.
K13 1290  9    He's probably spending the evening with friends".
K13 1300  6       "And for that he needs a little bag"?
K13 1310  4       They went shopping in the neighborhood, and bought
K13 1320  3    two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had
K13 1320 13    been given in Blois, and some cheese, and a dozen eggs,
K13 1330 10    and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the Place Redoute-
K13 1340  8    the first oranges they had seen since they landed.
K13 1350  5    They had Vermouth, sitting in front of a cafe. When
K13 1360  2    they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness
K13 1360 11    in the apartment, and thought how, under different
K13 1370  6    circumstances, they might have stayed on here, in these
K13 1380  6    old-fashioned, high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him
K13 1390  3    of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties. They
K13 1400  1    could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole
K13 1400 10    days.
K13 1400 11       He went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom, to turn
K13 1410 10    on the hot-water heater, and on the side of the tub
K13 1420  9    he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks. He felt
K13 1430  4    them. They were damp. He reached out and felt the bath
K13 1440  2    towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub. Damp
K13 1440 12    also. He looked around the room and then called out:
K13 1450  8    "Come here, quick"?
K13 1460  1       "What is it"? Barbara asked, standing in the doorway.
K13 1460 10    "I've solved the mystery of the little bag. There it
K13 1470 10    is ... and there is what was in it. But where do people
K13 1480 10    go swimming in Paris? That boat in the river, maybe".
K13 1490  7       "What boat"?
K13 1500  1       "There's a big boat anchored near the Place de la
K13 1500 10    Concorde, with a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice
K13 1510  9    it? But if he has time to go swimming, he had time
K13 1520  7    to be with us".
K13 1520 11       She looked at him in surprise.
K13 1530  4       "I know", he said, reading her mind.
K13 1540  1       "I don't know what I'm going to do with you".
K13 1540 11       "It's because we are in France", he said, "and know
K13 1550 10    so few people. So something like this matters more
K13 1560  7    than it would at home. Also, he was so nice when he
K13 1570  7    was nice".
K13 1570  9       "All because I didn't feel like dancing".
K13 1580  4       "I don't think it was that, really".
K13 1590  1       "Then what was it"?
K13 1590  5       "I don't know. I wish I did. The tweed coat, maybe.
K13 1600  8    The thing about Eugene is that he's very proud".
K13 1610  4       And the thing about hurt feelings, the wet bathing
K13 1620  3    suit pointed out, is that the person who has them is
K13 1620 14    not quite the innocent party he believes himself to
K13 1630  8    be. For instance- what about all those people Harold
K13 1640  6    Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly, as if this were
K13 1650  5    the one moment they would ever have together, their
K13 1650 14    one chance of knowing each other?
K13 1660  6       Fortunately, the embarrassing questions raised by
K13 1670  4    objects do not need to be answered, or we would all
K13 1680  2    have to go sleep in the open fields. And in any case,
K13 1680 14    answers may clarify but they do not change anything.
