F39 0010  1    This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that
F39 0010  9    traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both
F39 0020  6    premarital chastity as the "ideal", and the double
F39 0030  4    standard holding females primarily responsible for
F39 0040  1    preserving the ideal.
F39 0040  4       Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's
F39 0050  3    schema of "identity vs. identity diffusion" as a conceptual
F39 0060  4    tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto
F39 0070  1    the diverse personality and family configurations of
F39 0070  8    the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted
F39 0080  7    earlier. Our discussion does not utilize all the identity
F39 0090  5    crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended to demonstrate
F39 0100  3    the utility of his theoretical schema for studying
F39 0110  1    unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from
F39 0110 10    a psychological standpoint, the effectual prevention
F39 0120  5    of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving
F39 0130  5    the socialization of the female from infancy through
F39 0140  2    adolescence.
F39 0140  3       Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that
F39 0150  3    begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old
F39 0160  1    age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced
F39 0160 10    with a series of identity crises. The successful and
F39 0170  7    positive resolution of these crises during adolescence
F39 0180  4    involves an epigenetic principle- during adolescence,
F39 0190  2    the individual's positive resolutions in each area
F39 0190  9    of identity crisis depend, to a considerable degree,
F39 0200  7    on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory
F39 0210  5    identity crises during his infancy, childhood, and
F39 0220  3    early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the adolescent's
F39 0230  2    delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood-
F39 0240  3    reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability
F39 0240 10    to resolve these various identity crises positively.
F39 0250  6       The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms
F39 0260  6    of time perspective vs. time diffusion. Time perspective-
F39 0270  3    the ability to plan for the future and to postpone
F39 0280  3    gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range
F39 0290  1    objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy
F39 0290  8    on, the individual has been able to rely on and trust
F39 0300  9    people and the world in which she lives. Erikson has
F39 0310  5    noted that, unless this trust developed early, the
F39 0320  2    time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and
F39 0320  9    temporarily, by all adolescents (as a result of their
F39 0330  9    remembering the more immediate gratification of wants
F39 0340  4    during childhood, while not yet having fully accepted
F39 0350  2    the long-range planning required by adulthood) may
F39 0350 10    develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.
F39 0360  9    Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense
F39 0370  6    of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to
F39 0380  3    act immediately.
F39 0380  5       These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated
F39 0390  4    in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in
F39 0400  2    earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently
F39 0400  9    feeling a desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the
F39 0410  9    moment, commitments, in love and sex, that would have
F39 0420  6    life-long consequences. Others displayed utter apathy
F39 0430  3    and indifference to any decision about the past or
F39 0430 12    the future. For many of these unwed mothers, the data
F39 0440  9    on their family life and early childhood experiences
F39 0450  5    revealed several indications and sources of their basic
F39 0460  2    mistrust of their parents in particular and of the
F39 0460 11    world in general.
F39 0470  2       However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's
F39 0480  1    failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy
F39 0480  8    and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic
F39 0490  6    with respect to a given area of identity diffusion
F39 0500  3    in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter
F39 0510  1    VI, some SNP females originally developed such trust
F39 0510  9    only during their adolescence, through the aid of,
F39 0520  8    and their identification with, alter-parents. In the
F39 0530  6    specific case of time diffusion, we must emphasize
F39 0540  3    the significance of the earlier development of mistrust
F39 0560  1    when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis
F39 0560 10    experienced by most (if not all) adolescents in our
F39 0570  8    society, and with the failure of the adolescent period
F39 0580  4    to provide opportunities for developing trust.
F39 0590  1       The adolescent experiences two closely related crises:
F39 0590  8    self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness; and
F39 0600  6    role-experimentation
F39 0610  1    vs. negative identity. A sense of self-certainty and
F39 0610 10    the freedom to experiment with different roles, or
F39 0620  7    confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative
F39 0630  5    to peer-group conformity, is more easily developed
F39 0640  2    during adolescence if, during early childhood, the
F39 0640  9    individual was permitted to exercise initiative and
F39 0650  7    encouraged to develop some autonomy.
F39 0660  2       However, if the child has been constantly surrounded,
F39 0670  1    during nursery and early school age, by peer groups;
F39 0670 10    inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and
F39 0680  8    group standards; and allowed little initiative in early
F39 0690  5    play and work patterns- then in adolescence her normal
F39 0700  3    degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with
F39 0710  1    whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable,
F39 0710  9    will be compounded. Her ostensible indifference to
F39 0720  5    and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by
F39 0730  4    anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the
F39 0740  3    manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been
F39 0740 11    indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt,
F39 0750  9    for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to, and
F39 0760  7    judged by, the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school
F39 0770  4    peer friends. To be different is to invite shame and
F39 0780  3    doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized
F39 0780 13    by one's parents, who already consider one different
F39 0790  7    and difficult to understand, than by one's peers, who
F39 0800  6    are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial
F39 0810  4    of adult status.
F39 0810  7       The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter
F39 0820  5    II, revealed both considerable preoccupation with
F39 0830  2    being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.
F39 0840  1    Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a
F39 0840 10    justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification
F39 0850  8    with others; but very few seemed aware that such acceptance
F39 0860  8    and identification need to be supplemented with more
F39 0870  6    enduring and stable identification of and with one's
F39 0880  3    self.
F39 0880  4       Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent
F39 0890  2    involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis.
F39 0900  1    The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement
F39 0900  7    and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete
F39 0910  7    tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he
F39 0920  7    or she developed autonomy, initiative, and self-discipline
F39 0930  3    during childhood. The developmental process involves
F39 0940  1    the individual's progressively experiencing a sense
F39 0940  7    of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed
F39 0950  5    tasks, having kept commitments, and having created
F39 0960  4    something (however small or simple- even a doll dress
F39 0970  2    of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought
F39 0980  1    to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of
F39 0980  9    the self-certainty that the adolescent needs, for experimenting
F39 0990  7    with many roles, and for the freedom to fail sometimes
F39 1000  7    in the process of exploring and discovering her skills
F39 1010  4    and abilities.
F39 1010  6       If she has not had such experiences, the female's
F39 1020  4    normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded.
F39 1030  3    She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted
F39 1040  1    with present and future alternatives- e.g., whether
F39 1040  8    to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of
F39 1050 10    a homemaker; whether to stay financially dependent
F39 1060  5    on her parents or help support herself while attending
F39 1070  3    school; whether to pursue a college education or a
F39 1080  1    job after high school; and whether to attend this or
F39 1080 11    that college and to follow this or that course of study.
F39 1090  9    Erikson has noted that, as this indecision mounts,
F39 1100  4    it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship". This
F39 1110  2    paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting-
F39 1110 10    and never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses
F39 1120  8    of study; and in the fact that she bases her decisions
F39 1130  8    about work, college, carreer, and studies on what others
F39 1140  5    are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity
F39 1150  1    with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes.
F39 1150  8    The absence, during her childhood and early adolescence,
F39 1170  7    of experiences in developing the self-discipline to
F39 1180  5    complete tasks within her ability- experiences that
F39 1190  2    would have been subsequent sources of anticipation
F39 1190  9    of achievement- and her lack of childhood opportunities
F39 1200  9    to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression,
F39 1210  7    both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the
F39 1220  6    freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally
F39 1230  1    in experimenting.
F39 1230  3       The comments made by some unwed mothers (quoted
F39 1240  2    in Chapter II) reflect this paralysis of workmanship.
F39 1240 10    They attended school and selected courses primarily
F39 1250  7    on the basis of decisions others made; they accepted
F39 1260  5    a job primarily because it was available, convenient,
F39 1270  2    and paid reasonably. These things both express and,
F39 1280  1    at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity
F39 1280 10    diffusion in an area that could have become a source
F39 1290 10    of developing dignity and self-certainty. As their
F39 1300  5    identity diffusion increased, they became more susceptible
F39 1310  2    to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.
F39 1310 10    These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of
F39 1320  7    school or work activities containing no anticipation
F39 1330  4    of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, no sense of
F39 1340  4    dignity derived from a job well done.
F39 1340 11       Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline
F39 1350  8    habits within a context of developing autonomy and
F39 1360  5    initiative have considerable significance for the prevention
F39 1370  4    of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories presented
F39 1380  2    above confirm this significance, though through different
F39 1390  1    facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers
F39 1390  9    had had no work experiences, household chores, and
F39 1400  5    responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence;
F39 1410  4    they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching
F39 1420  3    for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both.
F39 1420 11    On the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much
F39 1430 11    work and responsibility imposed on them at an early
F39 1440  7    age, and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity
F39 1450  3    to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work
F39 1460  1    and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens-
F39 1460  8    to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and
F39 1470  7    experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior.
F39 1480  3       The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that
F39 1490  3    Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion
F39 1500  1    of ideals. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane
F39 1500 11    to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy,
F39 1510  6    we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our
F39 1520  5    data.
F39 1520  6       Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize
F39 1530  4    ideas and values, to perceive things as "either-or",
F39 1540  3    black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant.
F39 1550  2    This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in
F39 1550 10    the literature on religious conversions and experiences
F39 1560  7    of adolescents. Erikson has postulated that such ideological
F39 1570  6    polarization temporarily resolves their search for
F39 1580  5    something stable and definite in the rapidly changing
F39 1590  2    and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and
F39 1590 10    adulthood. It provides identification- with an idea,
F39 1600  7    a value, a cause that cuts through, or even transcends,
F39 1610  6    the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage
F39 1620  4    from child to adult, and permits their forceful and
F39 1630  2    overt expression of emotion.
F39 1630  6       The positive development, during adolescence, of
F39 1640  3    this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with
F39 1650  1    increasing independence, and to identify overtly either
F39 1650  8    with or against given ideas, values, and practices,
F39 1660  6    depends to a considerable degree on both previous and
F39 1670  5    present opportunities for developing autonomy, initiative,
F39 1680  2    and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological
F39 1690  1    diffusion at various developmental stages, as they
F39 1690  8    experience a proliferation of ideas and values. The
F39 1700  6    diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become
F39 1710  5    fixed, however, in those who have had no or very minimal
F39 1720  2    opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative
F39 1720  9    that could have been directed into constructive expression
F39 1730  7    and so served as sources of developing self-certainty.
F39 1740  5       A pronounced ideological diffusion- i.e., inability
F39 1750  3    to identify independently with given ideas and value
F39 1760  4    systems- is reflected in many ways. For example, it
F39 1770  2    is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs
F39 1770 11    and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction
F39 1780  7    again the ideas and behavior patterns of others, rather
F39 1790  5    than his inner conviction and choice. It is mirrored
F39 1800  4    by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and behavior
F39 1810  2    patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they
F39 1810 10    always coincide with those of the individual or group
F39 1820  8    present and most important at the moment. In another
F39 1830  6    sense, it is represented in the arguments of the "true
F39 1840  4    believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all
F39 1850  1    other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence
F39 1850 10    in theirs.
F39 1860  1       The case histories provide some interesting illustrations
F39 1860  8    of ideological diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's
F39 1870  7    inability to identify independently with a given value
F39 1880  6    system or behavior pattern, and her subsequent disinclination
F39 1890  4    to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual
F39 1900  4    behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed
F39 1910  1    their frustration with males who did not indicate more
F39 1910 10    explicitly "what it is they really want from a girl
F39 1920  9    so one can act accordingly". They were disappointed
F39 1930  4    by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual
F39 1940  2    intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers
F39 1940  9    for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.
F39 1950  7    They criticized parents for never having emphasized
F39 1960  5    traditional concepts of right and wrong; and they censured
F39 1970  4    parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive"
F39 1980  1    or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".
F39 1990  1       In the adult world, there are a number of rather
F39 1990 11    general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion
F39 2000  6    that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning
F39 2010  5    during this particular identity crisis. For example,
F39 2020  3    some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good guys"
F39 2030  2    and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes
F39 2030 13    and weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify)
F39 2040 11    asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic
F39 2050  6    psychological, familial, and social experiences.
