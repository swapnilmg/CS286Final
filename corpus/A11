A11 0010  1    _MIAMI, FLA., MARCH 17_
A11 0010  5       - The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of
A11 0020  2    being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League
A11 0030  1    clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition
A11 0030 10    decision, this one to the Kansas City Athletics by
A11 0040  9    a score of 5 to 3.
A11 0050  1       Indications as late as the top of the sixth were
A11 0050 11    that the Birds were to end their victory draought as
A11 0060  8    they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage.
A11 0080  1    #SIEBERN HITS HOMER#
A11 0080  4    Over the first five frames, Jack Fisher, the big righthandler
A11 0090  5    who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for
A11 0100  4    a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held the
A11 0110  2    A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.
A11 0120  1       Then Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the
A11 0120  8    contest and only five batters needed to face him before
A11 0130  8    there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.
A11 0140  1       A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast
A11 0140 12    by Bill Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the
A11 0150 10    eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory
A11 0160  5    in eight starts.
A11 0160  8    #HOUSE THROWS WILD#
A11 0170  1    With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew
A11 0170 10    a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle. Catcher
A11 0180  7    Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry
A11 0190  7    was wide and in the dirt.
A11 0190 13       Then Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled
A11 0200  7    up the middle and Throneberry was across with what
A11 0210  6    proved to be the winning run.
A11 0220  1       Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde
A11 0220  7    at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth
A11 0230  9    tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser, a wild
A11 0240  5    pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop
A11 0250  2    Jerry Adair's glove into center.
A11 0250  7       The Orioles once again performed at the plate in
A11 0260  8    powderpuff fashion, gathering only seven blows off
A11 0270  5    the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers. Three
A11 0280  1    were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv
A11 0280 10    Breeding one.
A11 0290  2    #HARTMAN IMPRESSIVE#
A11 0290  4    Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound
A11 0300  5    chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play
A11 0310  3    the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.
A11 0320  1       The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs
A11 0320 12    off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the
A11 0330  9    fourth. Hartman, purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee
A11 0340  7    Braves last fall, allowed no hits in his scoreless
A11 0350  4    three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.
A11 0360  1       Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the
A11 0360 12    Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames,
A11 0370  8    escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds
A11 0380  7    threatened but failed to tally.
A11 0390  4    #ROBINSON DOUBLES AGAIN#
A11 0400  3    In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second double
A11 0410  2    of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into
A11 0410 14    left.
A11 0420  1       Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles
A11 0420  9    fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring,
A11 0430  7    worked Keegan for a base on balls.
A11 0440  2       Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.
A11 0450  1       Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing
A11 0450 11    in a bunt attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back
A11 0460  9    of short.
A11 0460 11       John Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling
A11 0470  8    off two 2-and-2 pitches, and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich,
A11 0480  7    bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end
A11 0490  7    the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.
A11 0500  1       The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding,
A11 0500 12    along with Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of
A11 0510 10    hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on Russ
A11 0520  7    Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild
A11 0530  4    pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.
A11 0540  1       The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on
A11 0540 12    three straight hits after two were out.
A11 0550  5       Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short
A11 0560  3    to start the rally.
A11 0560  7    #LUMPE ERRS#
A11 0560  9    Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove
A11 0570  7    and beat it out for a single, and when Lumpe grabbed
A11 0580  4    the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's
A11 0590  1    head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
A11 0600  1       Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center
A11 0600 10    to score both runners. When Robinson tried to stretch
A11 0610  7    his blow into a triple, he was cut down in a close
A11 0620  7    play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.
A11 0630  1       The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring
A11 0630  8    in the sixth went like this:
A11 0640  3       Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face
A11 0640 13    Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next
A11 0650  9    toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center.
A11 0660  7    #CAREY SINGLES#
A11 0660  9    Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which
A11 0670  9    Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first.
A11 0680  6    It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.
A11 0690  1       Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play.
A11 0690  9    Breeding to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot
A11 0700 10    homer over the wall in left center.
A11 0710  5       If the Orioles are to break their losing streak
A11 0720  2    within the next two days, it will have to be at the
A11 0720 14    expense of the American League champion New York Yankees,
A11 0730  9    who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single
A11 0740  9    test Sunday afternoon.
A11 0750  1    _MIAMI, FLA., MARCH 17_
A11 0750  5       - The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League
A11 0760  3    news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles
A11 0770  1    were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations
A11 0770 10    under the Army's military training program and is ready
A11 0780  9    for belated spring training.
A11 0790  3       Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers
A11 0800  3    and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average, completes
A11 0800 14    the Birds' spring squad at 49 players.
A11 0810  7       The big, 22-year-old shortstop, the 1960 American
A11 0820  5    league "rookie-of-the year", flew here late this afternoon
A11 0830  4    from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated
A11 0840  1    $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss
A11 0840 12    to Kansas City- the winless Birds' sixth setback in
A11 0850  7    a row.
A11 0850  9    #15 POUNDS LIGHTER#
A11 0860  2    The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds,
A11 0870  1    15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring.
A11 0870 10    He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before
A11 0880  9    the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence.
A11 0890  3       When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox,
A11 0900  2    Ky., Hansen's weight had dropped to 180- "too light
A11 0910  1    for me to be at my best" he said.
A11 0910 10       "I feel good physically", Hansen added, "but I think
A11 0920  6    I'll move better carrying a little less weight than
A11 0930  4    I'm carrying now".
A11 0930  7    #SEEKS "IMPROVED FIELDING"#
A11 0940  1    The rangy, Albany (Cal.) native, a surprise slugging
A11 0950  1    sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive
A11 0950 12    whiz, set "improved fielding" as his 1961 goal.
A11 0970  1       "I think I can do a better job with the glove, now
A11 0970 13    that I know the hitters around the league a little
A11 0980  9    better", he said.
A11 0990  1       Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami
A11 0990 10    Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game
A11 1000  9    weekend series with the New York Yankees.
A11 1010  3       Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's veteran
A11 1020  2    knuckleball specialists, are slated to oppose the American
A11 1030  1    League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest.
A11 1030  8    #DUREN, SHELDON ON HILL#
A11 1040  3    Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon, a rookie righthander
A11 1050  1    who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn
A11 1050 13    (N.Y.) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania
A11 1060 10    League, are the probable rival pitchers.
A11 1070  6       Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker,
A11 1080  4    22, are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores
A11 1090  2    against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M.
A11 1100  1    encounter.
A11 1100  2       Ralph Houk, successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee
A11 1110  2    helm, plans to bring the entire New York squad here
A11 1110 12    from St. Petersburg, including Joe Dimaggio and large
A11 1120  8    crowds are anticipated for both weekend games. The
A11 1130  6    famed Yankee Clipper, now retired, has been assisting
A11 1140  4    as a batting coach.
A11 1140  8    #SQUAD CUT NEAR#
A11 1140 11    Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after
A11 1150 10    completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime
A11 1160  6    military course, also at Fort Knox, Ky. The 22-year-old
A11 1170  8    southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen.
A11 1180  5       Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now
A11 1190  2    gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards
A11 1190 10    and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined
A11 1200 12    and workable unit.
A11 1210  1    #@#
A11 1210  2    "Take a ride on this one", Brooks Robinson greeted
A11 1220  1    Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed
A11 1220 11    for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double
A11 1230  9    off the left-centerfield wall tonight.
A11 1240  3       It was the first of two doubles by Robinson, who
A11 1250  2    was in a mood to celebrate.
A11 1250  8       Just before game time, Robinson's pretty wife, Connie
A11 1260  4    informed him that an addition to the family can be
A11 1270  3    expected late next summer.
A11 1270  7       Unfortunately, Brooks' teammates were not in such
A11 1280  6    festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit
A11 1290  4    pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers.
A11 1290 11    #@#
A11 1300  1    Hansen arrived just before nightfall, two hours late,
A11 1300  9    in company with Lee MacPhail; J. A. W. Iglehart, chairman
A11 1310  9    of the Oriole board of directors, and Public Relations
A11 1320  8    Director Jack Dunn.
A11 1330  1       Their flight was delayed, Dunn said, when a boarding
A11 1330 10    ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the
A11 1340 10    plane.
A11 1340 11    #@#
A11 1340 12    Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney, now catching for the A's
A11 1350  8    is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to
A11 1360  6    the West Coast.
A11 1370  1       "But they shouldda brought in Tokyo, too", added
A11 1370  8    Old Scrapiron. "Then we'd really have someplace to
A11 1380  7    go".
A11 1390  1    _BOWIE, MD., MARCH 17_
A11 1390  5       - Gaining her second straight victory, Norman B.,
A11 1400  3    Small, Jr.'s Garden Fresh, a 3-year-old filly, downed
A11 1410  2    promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse,
A11 1420  1    featured seventh race here today, and paid $7.20 straight.
A11 1420 10       Toying with her field in the early stages, Garden
A11 1430  9    Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by
A11 1440  8    Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half
A11 1450  4    in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs.

A11 1590  1    _CLEVELAND, MARCH 17 (AP)_
A11 1590  5       - George Kerr, the swift-striding Jamaican, set
A11 1610  3    a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of
A11 1610 15    Columbus track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave
A11 1620  7    Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1.
A11 1630  4       Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month
A11 1640  1    in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's
A11 1640 12    early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king
A11 1650 11    by 5 yards. Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8
A11 1660  8    set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.
A11 1670  1       Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through
A11 1670 11    two thirds of the race. Then Kerr, a graduate student
A11 1680  8    from Illinois, moved past him on a straightaway and
A11 1690  6    held off Mills's challenge on the final turn. Mills
A11 1700  2    was timed in 1.10.4.
A11 1700  6       The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games,
A11 1710  6    final indoor meet of the season, got a thrill a few
A11 1720  4    minutes earlier when a slender, bespectacled woman
A11 1720 11    broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile
A11 1730 11    run.
A11 1730 12       Mrs. Grace Butcher, of nearby Chardon, a 27-year-old
A11 1740  9    housewife who has two children, finished in 2.21.6.
A11 1750  5    She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set
A11 1760  4    by Helen Shipley, of Wellsley College, in the National
