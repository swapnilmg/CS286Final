A35 0010  1       THERE ARE, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms
A35 0010 10    of adaptation and defense that are just too complete
A35 0020  9    and too satisfactory. Mollusks are a case in point.
A35 0030  7    The shell, which served the strain so well at a relatively
A35 0040  6    early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended to cancel
A35 0050  3    out the possibility of future development. Though this
A35 0050 11    may or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate
A35 0060 11    the strength and the weakness of American Catholic
A35 0070  6    higher education.
A35 0070  8       There can be no doubt that the American Catholic
A35 0080  8    accomplishment in the field of higher education is
A35 0090  5    most impressive: our European brethren never cease
A35 0100  2    to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges
A35 0100 13    and universities. The deeper wonder is how this miracle
A35 0110  8    was accomplished in decades, rather than in centuries
A35 0120  5    and by immigrant minorities at that. By way of explanation
A35 0130  5    we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement
A35 0140  1    stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity
A35 0140 10    which brought the parochial school system into existence.
A35 0150  8       There is, however, one curious discrepancy in this
A35 0160  8    broad and flattering picture. Viewing the American
A35 0170  4    Catholic educational achievement in retrospect, we
A35 0180  2    may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from
A35 0180 12    grade school to university. But the simple truth is
A35 0190  8    that higher education has never really been an official
A35 0200  6    American Catholic project; certainly not in the same
A35 0210  5    sense that the establishment of a parochial school
A35 0220  1    system has been a matter of official policy.
A35 0220  9       Official encouragement is one thing, but the down-to-earth
A35 0230  9    test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds.
A35 0240  4    American Catholics have responded generously to bishops'
A35 0250  3    and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create
A35 0260  2    parochial schools but they have not contributed in
A35 0260 10    a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions
A35 0270  7    of higher learning. They have not done so for the simple
A35 0280  8    reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made.
A35 0290  4    Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this
A35 0300  1    as their direct responsibility.
A35 0300  5       All of this may be understandable enough: it is,
A35 0310  4    however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities
A35 0320  2    could have acted otherwise. Yet for better or for worse,
A35 0330  1    the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic
A35 0330 11    colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic
A35 0340  8    support but rather to the initiative, resourcefulness
A35 0350  4    and sacrifices of individual religious communities.
A35 0360  2    Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell
A35 0370  2    which has made the achievement possible.
A35 0370  8       To understand the past history- and the future potential-
A35 0380  8    of American Catholic higher education, it is necessary
A35 0390  6    to appreciate the special character of the esprit d'
A35 0400  5    corps of the religious community. It is something more
A35 0410  2    than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety
A35 0410 11    and detachment. A religious community with a vital
A35 0420  8    sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation
A35 0430  6    and group identification seldom found elsewhere. The
A35 0440  3    fact that the group orientation and group identification
A35 0450  1    are founded on supernatural principles and nourished
A35 0450  8    by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a
A35 0460  7    deeper and more satisfying dimension. The net result
A35 0470  4    is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship, the
A35 0480  2    kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts
A35 0480 10    the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship.
A35 0490  6       American Catholic colleges and universities are,
A35 0500  4    in a very real sense, the product of "private enterprise"-
A35 0510  1    the "private enterprise" of religious communities.
A35 0520  1    Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan
A35 0520 10    authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing
A35 0530  9    institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish
A35 0540  6    collections and staffed by religious as paid employees.
A35 0550  4    There is however no point in speculating about such
A35 0560  1    a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions
A35 0560 12    of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit
A35 0570  9    not unlike that which produces the "family business".
A35 0580  5    This "family-community" spirit is the real explanation
A35 0590  5    of the marvel of our achievement.
A35 0590 11    ##
A35 0600  1    IT IS this spirit which explains some of the anomalies
A35 0600 11    of American Catholic higher education, in particular
A35 0610  6    the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas. I
A35 0620  6    think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully
A35 0630  3    small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of
A35 0640  1    a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational.
A35 0640 10    This is not an isolated example; this aspect of the
A35 0650  8    total picture has been commented upon often enough.
A35 0660  4    It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot.
A35 0670  3       Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication,
A35 0680  1    there is another aspect of the "family business" spirit
A35 0690  1    in American Catholic higher education which deserves
A35 0690  8    closer scrutiny. For while the past needs of the Church
A35 0700  9    in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate
A35 0710  6    institutions, which in temper and tone closely resembled
A35 0720  3    junior colleges and finishing schools, it would seem
A35 0730  2    that today's need is for the college which more closely
A35 0730 12    resembles the university in its "pursuit of excellence".
A35 0740  8    At the earlier "pre-academic excellence" stage of Catholic
A35 0750  7    education, the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural
A35 0760  8    community basis. But with today's demand for professional
A35 0770  4    qualifications and specialized training, the need for
A35 0780  4    "outsiders" become more pressing.
A35 0780  8    ##
A35 0780  9    THE PROBLEM is not merely that more "outside teachers"
A35 0790  8    are needed but that a different brand is called for.
A35 0800  8    Commenting on the earlier stage, the Notre Dame Chapter
A35 0810  5    of the American Association of University Professors
A35 0830  1    (in a recent report on the question of faculty participation
A35 0840  1    in administrative decision-making) noted that the term
A35 0840  9    "teacher-employee" (as opposed to, e.g., "maintenance
A35 0850  6    employee") was a not inapt description. Today however,
A35 0860  7    the "outsider" is likely to have professional qualifications
A35 0870  5    of the highest order (otherwise the college would not
A35 0880  5    be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized
A35 0890  1    to the democratic processes of the secular or state
A35 0890 10    university. And while no one expects total democracy
A35 0900  7    on the academic scene, the scholar will be particularly
A35 0910  4    sensitive to a line between first and second class
A35 0920  2    citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic
A35 0920 12    rank or professional achievement.
A35 0930  4       In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame
A35 0940  4    Chapter of the American Association of University Professors,
A35 0950  2    the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges
A35 0960  1    very clearly in the very statement of the problem as
A35 0960 11    the members see it: "Even with the best of intentions
A35 0970  8    he (the President of the university) is loath to delegate
A35 0980  6    such authority and responsibility to a group the membership
A35 0990  5    of which, considered (as it must be by him) in individual
A35 1000  2    terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying
A35 1010  1    temperament, interests and capabilities. It is natural
A35 1010  8    that he should turn for his major support to a select
A35 1020  9    and dedicated few from the organization which actually
A35 1030  3    owns the university and whose goals are, in their opinion,
A35 1040  3    identified with its highest good and (to use that oft-repeated
A35 1050  1    phrase) 'the attainment of excellence'".
A35 1050  6       The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar
A35 1060  7    to Notre Dame: it is simply that the paradox involved
A35 1070  5    in this kind of control of the institution by "the
A35 1080  3    organization which actually owns" it, becomes more
A35 1080 10    obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished
A35 1090  9    "outside" faculty. It is particularly interesting that
A35 1100  6    those who framed the report should refer to "the organization
A35 1110  6    which actually owns the university": this seems to
A35 1130  4    show an awareness of the fact that there is more to
A35 1140  2    the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay
A35 1140 11    tension. But in any case, one does not have to read
A35 1150 10    very closely between the lines to realize that the
A35 1160  5    situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one.
A35 1170  2    "Outside" faculty members want to be considered partners
A35 1170 10    in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees
A35 1180  9    of a family business.
A35 1190  1       There are two reasons why failure to come to grips
A35 1190 11    with this demand could be fatal to the future of the
A35 1200 11    Catholic university. In the first place there is the
A35 1210  8    obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel.
A35 1220  2    Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession,
A35 1230  1    much given to attending meetings and conferences. Expressions
A35 1240  1    of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college
A35 1240 10    faculty member has the effect of confirming the already
A35 1250  8    existing stereotype. In the academic world there is
A35 1260  6    seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott:
A35 1270  3    all that happens is that the better qualified teacher
A35 1270 12    declines to gamble two or three years of his life on
A35 1280 11    the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution
A35 1290  5    will be as good as those elsewhere.
A35 1300  1       To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should
A35 1300 10    be realized that while college teaching is almost a
A35 1310  8    public symbol of security, that security does not come
A35 1320  6    as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary
A35 1330  4    school system or in the Civil Service. Much has been
A35 1340  2    made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now
A35 1340 11    guarantee firm tenure. This is a significant advance
A35 1350  8    but its import should not be exaggerated. When a man
A35 1360  6    invests a block of his years at a university without
A35 1370  2    gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced
A35 1370 11    with the problem of starting over but there is also
A35 1380  9    a certain depreciation in the market value of his services.
A35 1390  7    A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects
A35 1400  5    that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions
A35 1410  2    is being reserved for members of the "family".
A35 1410 10    ##
A35 1410 11    JUST AS IT is possible to exaggerate the drawing power
A35 1420 10    of the new tenure practices, it is also possible to
A35 1430  8    exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate
A35 1440  6    salaries paid by major Catholic institutions. Adequate
A35 1450  2    compensation is indispensable. Yet adequate compensation-
A35 1460  3    and particularly merely adequate compensation is no
A35 1460 10    substitute for those intangibles which cause a man
A35 1470  8    to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking
A35 1480  5    up college teaching in the first place. Broadly speaking
A35 1490  2    the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible
A35 1500  1    but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation
A35 1500 12    and mature responsibility in the total work of the
A35 1510  8    university. Religious who derive their own sense of
A35 1520  6    purpose through identification with the religious community
A35 1530  2    rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate
A35 1540  1    both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need
A35 1540 10    for this identification.
A35 1550  2       There is no need here to spell out the conditions
A35 1560  1    of creative teaching except to point out that, at the
A35 1560 11    college level, the sense of community and of community
A35 1570  9    responsibility is even more necessary than it is at
A35 1580  7    other levels. The college teacher needs the stimulus
A35 1590  3    of communication with other faculty members but he
A35 1590 11    also needs to feel that such communication, even informal
A35 1600  9    debates over the luncheon table, are a contribution
A35 1610  6    to the total good of the institution. But this in turn
A35 1620  5    means that decisions are not merely imposed from the
A35 1630  2    top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty
A35 1630 12    participation.
A35 1640  1       The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy
A35 1650  1    between faculty members who are part of the "in-group"
A35 1650 11    that owns and operates the institution and those who
A35 1660  7    are merely paid employees, is, therefore, the baneful
A35 1670  4    effect on the caliber of the teaching itself. This
A35 1680  2    is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions
A35 1680 10    of salary and tenure. Yet though it may seem difficult
A35 1690  9    to envision any definitive resolution of the problem
A35 1700  5    of ownership and control, there are nevertheless certain
A35 1710  2    suggestions which seem to be in order.
A35 1710  9       The first is a negative warning: there is no point
A35 1720  9    in the creation of faculty committees and advisory
A35 1730  4    boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority.
A35 1740  2    In the case of academic personnel the "feeling" of
A35 1750  1    participation can hardly be "faked". Competent teachers
A35 1750  8    are well versed in the technique of leading students
A35 1760  8    to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students'
A35 1770  4    illusion that they are making their own decisions.
A35 1780  2    Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar
A35 1790  1    with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student
A35 1790  9    government to be taken in by "busy-work" and ersatz
A35 1800  9    decision making.
A35 1810  1       In any case it is by no means clear that formally
A35 1810 12    structured organs of participation are what is called
A35 1820  6    for at all. In the Notre Dame report, reference was
A35 1830  3    made to the fact that faculty members were reduced
A35 1840  1    to "luncheon-table communication". In itself there
A35 1840  8    is nothing wrong with this form of "participation":
A35 1850  6    the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that
A35 1860  5    those faculty members who are in a position to implement
A35 1870  3    policy, i.e., members of the religious community which
A35 1880  1    owns and administers the institution, have their own
A35 1880  9    eating arrangements.
