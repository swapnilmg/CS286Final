A30 0010  1       A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting
A30 0010  9    won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th
A30 0020  8    annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday.
A30 0030  2       Mrs. Alice H. Reese, wife of an engineer and mother
A30 0040  2    of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at
A30 0040 14    a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Mrs. Reese
A30 0050  8    entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals.
A30 0060  7       Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara
A30 0070  7    L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring, a rich yeast
A30 0080  5    bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze.
A30 0090  1    #MOTHER OF FIVE#
A30 0090  3    Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of
A30 0100  2    a machinist. She lives in Wellsville, Mo.
A30 0100  9       Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third
A30 0110  8    time in the Bake-off finals. And the third time was
A30 0120  6    the charm.
A30 0120  8       She dreamed up the cooky recipe, tried it, liked
A30 0130  4    it and entered it in the contest. The second baking
A30 0140  1    was for photographing when told she was a finalist.
A30 0140 10    The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton
A30 0150  9    ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges.
A30 0170  1       Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner
A30 0180  1    on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs.
A30 0180 12    Norman Chandler, chairman of the Music Center Building
A30 0190  7    Fund Committee, and Mr. Chandler.
A30 0200  3       Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and
A30 0210  2    development industry to raise funds in support of this
A30 0210 11    cultural center for the performing arts.
A30 0220  6       A feature of the party will be a presentation by
A30 0230  5    Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides and
A30 0240  2    renderings of the three-building complex.
A30 0240  8    #FOLIAGE WILL GLOW AT FORMAL FALL PARTY#
A30 0250  5    Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles
A30 0260  2    Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening.
A30 0270  1    More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which
A30 0270 11    is matched in the spring.
A30 0280  3       Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes.
A30 0290  2    William A. Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A. B. Cox, David
A30 0300  2    Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson.
A30 0310  1       Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins, and J.
A30 0310 10    Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson.
A30 0320  7    #GUESTS FROM ACROSS U.S. HONOR DR. SWIM#
A30 0330  4    When Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at
A30 0340  4    the Wilshire Country Club, guests came by chartered
A30 0350  1    plane from all over the country.
A30 0350  7       A flight originating in Florida picked up guests
A30 0360  5    on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from
A30 0370  3    Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points.
A30 0380  1       Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more
A30 0380 10    than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced
A30 0390  9    in Los Angeles. He started practice in 1917, and served
A30 0400  6    on the State Board of Medical Examiners.
A30 0420  1       Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for
A30 0420 11    Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg, a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler
A30 0430  7    had predicted would have a promising career on the
A30 0440  7    concert stage.
A30 0440  9       A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end
A30 0450  9    to the 10-hour daily practicing. She put the violin
A30 0460  5    away and took out some linen, needles and yarn to while
A30 0470  2    away the long, idle days in Budapest.
A30 0470  9       Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on
A30 0480  5    two continents and, at 26, she feels she is on the
A30 0490  4    threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles.
A30 0490 13       Her days as an art student at the University of
A30 0500 10    Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian
A30 0510  5    uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled
A30 0520  3    to Vienna.
A30 0520  5       There they continued their studies at the university,
A30 0530  4    she in art, he in architecture. And there she had her
A30 0540  2    first showing of tapestry work.
A30 0550  1       There's a lot of talk about the problem of education
A30 0550 11    in America today. What most people don't seem to realize,
A30 0560  9    if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am, is that
A30 0570 11    90% of the problem is transportation.
A30 0580  1       I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved
A30 0590  1    until, at long last, both of my boys got squeezed into
A30 0590 12    high school. It seems like only last year that we watched
A30 0600 10    them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day
A30 0610  9    in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar
A30 0620  4    school.
A30 0620  5       Getting to and from school was no problem. They
A30 0630  3    either walked or were driven.
A30 0630  8    #@#
A30 0630  9    Now they go to a high school that is two miles away.
A30 0640  9    One might think the problem would be similar. They
A30 0650  4    could walk, ride on a bus or be driven.
A30 0660  1       It's much more complex than that. Generally, they
A30 0660  9    go to school with a girl named Gloriana, who lives
A30 0670  7    down the block, and has a car.
A30 0680  1       This is a way of getting to school, but, I understand,
A30 0680 12    it entails a certain loss of social status. A young
A30 0690  9    man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school
A30 0700  7    in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher
A30 0710  4    class than he is, and is also a girl.
A30 0710 13       "Why don't you walk to school then"? I suggested.
A30 0720  8    "My father walked, through two miles of snow, in Illinois".
A30 0730  8       "Did you"? I was asked.
A30 0740  4       "No", I said, "I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois".
A30 0750  4       I explained, however, that I had my share of hardship
A30 0760  3    in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom.
A30 0760 13    #@#
A30 0770  1    I had to ride a streetcar two miles. Sometimes the
A30 0770 11    streetcar was late. Sometimes there weren't even any
A30 0780  8    seats. I had to stand up, with the ladies. Sometimes
A30 0790  6    I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at
A30 0800  4    all, but wound up at the ocean, or some other dismal
A30 0800 15    place, and had to spend the day there.
A30 0810  8       I've tried to compromise by letting them take the
A30 0820  6    little car now and then. When they do that my wife
A30 0830  3    has to drive me to work in the big car. She has to
A30 0830 16    have at least one car herself. I feel a certain loss
A30 0840 10    of status when I am driven up in front of work in a
A30 0850  8    car driven by my wife, who is only a woman.
A30 0860  1       Even that isn't satisfactory. If they have to take
A30 0860 10    any car, they'd rather take the big one. They say that
A30 0870 10    when they take a car, Gloriana doesn't take her car,
A30 0880  7    but rides with them. But when Gloriana rides with them
A30 0890  5    they also have to take the two girls who usually ride
A30 0900  2    with her, so the little car isn't big enough.
A30 0900 11    #@#
A30 0900 12    The logic of that is impeccable, of course, except
A30 0910  9    that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in
A30 0920  8    a little car, by my wife, when everybody knows I have
A30 0930  4    a big car and am capable of driving myself.
A30 0930 13       The solution, naturally, is the bus. However, it's
A30 0940  8    a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to
A30 0950  9    the bus, and it's too hard on my legs.
A30 0960  2       My wife could drive us down the hill and we could
A30 0960 13    all walk from there. But that's hardly realistic.
A30 0980  7       Nobody walks any more but crackpots and Harry Truman,
A30 0990  7    and he's already got an education.
A30 1010  1       Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does
A30 1010 10    not mention names dropped as did the notices for the
A30 1020  9    New York Social Register which made news last week.
A30 1030  6       Published annually by William Hord Richardson, the
A30 1040  4    1962 edition, subtitled Society Register of Southern
A30 1050  2    California, is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's
A30 1060  1    postman.
A30 1060  2       Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book "but
A30 1070  1    it still remains the compact reference book used by
A30 1070 10    so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers,
A30 1080  6    addresses, other residences, club affiliations and
A30 1100  3    marriages".
A30 1100  4    #STARS FOR MARRIAGE#
A30 1100  7    Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages
A30 1110  7    during the past year. Last two to be added before the
A30 1120  7    book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane
A30 1130  2    Cooper, daughter of the Grant B. Coopers, to Robert
A30 1140  1    Knox Worrell, and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard
A30 1140 10    Pen Tudor.
A30 1150  1       Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan McFarland Chandler
A30 1160  1    Jr.; Joanne Curry, daughter of the Ellsworth Currys,
A30 1170  8    to James Hartley Gregg, and Valerie Smith to James
A30 1180  8    McAlister Duque.
A30 1190  1       Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning,
A30 1190  9    daughter of the George L. Brownings, to Austin C. Smith
A30 1200 10    Jr.; Cynthia Flower, daughter of the Ludlow Flowers
A30 1220  7    Jr., to Todd Huntington, son of the David Huntingtons.
A30 1240  6    #PASADENA LISTINGS#
A30 1240  8    Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the
A30 1250 10    new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins III.
A30 1260  5    She is the former Judy Chapman, daughter of John S.
A30 1270  5    Chapman of this city. The young couple live in Pasadena.
A30 1280  3    Another marriage of note is that of Jane McAlester
A30 1290  1    and William Louis Pfau.
A30 1290  5       Changes in address are noted.
A30 1300  1       For instance, the Edwin Pauleys Jr., formerly of
A30 1300  9    Chantilly Rd., are now at home on North Arden Dr. in
A30 1310 11    Beverly Hills.
A30 1320  1       Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire
A30 1320 10    and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd. The

A30 1340  6    to Southern California and are now residing on South
A30 1350  7    Arden Blvd. But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their
A30 1360  4    residence in Southern California for Mexico City.
A30 1370  2    #MORE NEW ADDRESSES#
A30 1370  5    Judge and Mrs. Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach,

A30 1420  9    Olerichs, the Joseph Aderholds Jr., the Henri de la
A30 1430  7    Chapelles, the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton
A30 1440  5    Crispin, the John Armisteads, the Allen Chases, the
A30 1450  3    Howard Lockies, the Thomas Lockies, and Anthony Longinotti.
A30 1460  2       Newcomers of social note from other parts of the

A30 1470 10    Geddes MacGregors, formerly of Scotland, and Mr. and
A30 1480  7    Mrs. Werner H. Althaus, formerly of Switzerland.
A30 1500  1       HERE'S an idea for a child's room that is easy to
A30 1500 12    execute and is completely charming, using puppets for
A30 1510  8    lamp bases. Most children love the animated puppet
A30 1520  5    faces and their flexible bodies, and they prefer to
A30 1530  4    see them as though the puppets were in action, rather
A30 1530 14    than put away in boxes. Displayed as lamps, the puppets
A30 1540 10    delight the children and are decorative accent.
A30 1550  5       To create such a lamp, order a wired pedestal from
A30 1560  5    any lamp shop. Measure the puppet to determine the
A30 1570  2    height of the light socket, allowing three to four
A30 1570 11    inches above the puppet's head. Make sure that the
A30 1580  7    metal tube through which the wire passes is in the
A30 1590  5    shape of an inverted "L", the foot of the "L" about
A30 1600  3    three inches long, so that the puppet can hang directly
A30 1610  1    under the light.
A30 1610  4    #PULLING STRINGS#
A30 1610  6    Using the strings that manipulate the puppet, suspend
A30 1620  4    him from the light fixture by tying the strings to
A30 1630  3    the lamp base. In this way, you can arrange his legs
A30 1630 14    and arms in any desired position, with feet, or one
A30 1640  9    foot, barely resting on the pedestal. If the puppets
A30 1650  6    are of uniform size, you can change them in accord
A30 1660  3    with your child's whims.
A30 1660  7       Although a straight drum shade would be adequate
A30 1670  5    and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be
A30 1680  2    changed without disharmony, it is far more fun to create
A30 1680 12    shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime. Those
A30 1690 10    illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round.
A30 1700 10    The scalloped edge is particularly appealing.
A30 1720  1       TODAY'S trend toward furniture designs from America's
A30 1730  1    past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed
A30 1730 10    respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial
A30 1740  6    era.
A30 1740  7       A generation ago there were plenty of people who
A30 1750  7    appreciated antiques and fine reproductions. In the
A30 1760  3    background lurked the feeling, however, that these
A30 1760 10    pieces, beautiful as they were, lacked the utilitarian
A30 1770  8    touch. So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out
A30 1780  6    with heavy, nondescript pieces that supposedly could
A30 1790  3    take the "hard knocks", while the fine secretary was
A30 1800  2    relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.
A30 1800 12       This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's,
A30 1810 10    according to decorator consultant, Leland Alden.
A30 1820  4       Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways
A30 1830  4    of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs,
A30 1840  1    says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because
A30 1840 11    Colonial craftsmen had "an innate sense of the practical".
A30 1850  9    #SOLID INVESTMENT#
A30 1860  1    There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century
A30 1870  1    designer had to develop "down to earth" designs- or
A30 1870 10    go out of business.
