B26 0010  1    #TENURE AS CRITERION#
B26 0010  4    I would like to add one more practical reform to those
B26 0020  3    mentioned by Russell Kirk [Dec. 16]. It has to do with
B26 0030  2    teachers' salaries and tenure.
B26 0030  6       Next September, after receiving a degree from Yale's
B26 0040  5    Master of Arts in Teaching Program, I will be teaching
B26 0050  5    somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage
B26 0060  2    of mathematics teachers. I will also be underpaid.
B26 0060 10    The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the
B26 0070 11    dearth of teachers. Teaching is at present a sellers'
B26 0080  6    market; as a result buyers, the public, must be satisfied
B26 0090  5    with second-rate teachers. But this is not the real
B26 0100  3    problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers
B26 0100 12    are usually paid on the basis of time served rather
B26 0110  9    than quality. Hence all teachers, good and bad, who
B26 0120  6    have been teaching for a given number of years are
B26 0130  3    paid the same salary. I am firmly convinced that considering
B26 0140  1    the average quality of teachers in this country, the
B26 0140 10    profession is grossly overpaid.
B26 0150  2       It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect
B26 0160  1    any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how
B26 0160 11    much the public will pay for shoddy performance. The
B26 0170  7    only hope which good teachers have for being paid their
B26 0180  6    due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers
B26 0190  4    up the economic ladder with them. The only hope which
B26 0200  1    the public has for getting good teachers is to pay
B26 0200 11    teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure.
B26 0210  6    Here, as in all sectors of the economy, quality and
B26 0220  3    justice are both dependent on the right of the individual
B26 0230  1    to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.

B26 0230 12    #LOSS OF INITIATIVE#
B26 0240  3    On the eve of the "great debate" on the proposal to
B26 0250  2    give the President broad powers to make across-the-board
B26 0250 12    tariff concessions which could practically bring us
B26 0260  6    into the Atlantic Community, we should face the alternatives
B26 0270  6    on this proposition. What we will be sacrificing in
B26 0280  4    any such arrangement will be our power to be selective
B26 0290  1    which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle
B26 0290  9    under which we now operate. Without this power we lay
B26 0300  9    open any American industry which the Europeans may
B26 0310  5    find it economically profitable to destroy to the will
B26 0320  4    of others. It is this loss of initiative in how we
B26 0320 15    conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative
B26 0330 11    in how we conduct our political affairs. @
B26 0340  6    #A BRIEF FOR THE NEGATIVE#
B26 0350  1    I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common
B26 0350 10    Market [Nov. 18] as a desirable organization for us
B26 0360  9    to join. For him to ignore the political consequences
B26 0370  5    involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult
B26 0380  5    to understand. The pressure for our entry to the Common
B26 0390  3    Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this
B26 0390 12    amalgamated trade union by way of a purely "economic
B26 0400  9    thoroughfare", or garden path, with the political ramifications
B26 0410  7    kept neatly in the background. The appeal is going
B26 0420  5    to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing
B26 0430  1    to those who do not see its relation to political and
B26 0430 12    legal, as well as economic, self-rule. In entering
B26 0440  9    this union we will be surrendering most, if not all,
B26 0450  5    of our economic autonomy to international bodies such
B26 0460  3    as the Atlantic Institute (recently set up) or the
B26 0460 12    O.E.C.D., I.M.F. and others. To think that we can merely
B26 0480  1    relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up
B26 0480  8    our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.
B26 0490  7       If it is not enough that all of our internationalist
B26 0500  5    One Worlders are advocating that we join this market,
B26 0510  3    I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine
B26 0520  2    section [Nov. 12, 1961], by Mr. Eric Johnston, entitled
B26 0530  2    "We Must Join the Common Market". He says: "It has
B26 0540  2    swept aside petty nationalisms, age-old rivalries,
B26 0540  9    and worn-out customs". Referring to Britain, he says,
B26 0550  7    "We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty
B26 0560  4    above all else willing to give up its economy, placing
B26 0570  3    this authority in Continental hands". ... Since the
B26 0580  2    goal of our international planners is a World Government,
B26 0580 11    this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in
B26 0590  8    that direction for, once American economic autonomy
B26 0600  4    is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question of time.
B26 0610  3    Frankly, it is being very cleverly done for, in a sense,
B26 0620  1    they have us over a barrel. Listen to what Mr. Johnston
B26 0620 12    has to say: "Consider the savage wounds that isolationism
B26 0630  8    would inflict. ... We would lose our export markets
B26 0640  8    and deny ourselves the imports we need. We would be
B26 0650  6    crippled by reduced output, industrial decline, widespread
B26 0660  2    unemployment".
B26 0660  3       But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation
B26 0670  5    of the United States into an Atlantic Community or
B26 0680  2    "economic empire", but merely what libertarians like
B26 0680  9    Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises have been arguing
B26 0690  9    for years: an end to government regulations, an end
B26 0700  7    to government competition in industry, and a realistic
B26 0710  4    depreciation allowance for industry. Create a free
B26 0720  2    market here, give us a sound, debt-free money system,
B26 0720 12    and we'll compete with anyone, Europe and Asia combined.
B26 0730  8    In short, get this governmental monstrosity off our
B26 0740  5    backs and we won't have to worry about European competition
B26 0750  3    or Communism either. If we want to preserve our sovereignty,
B26 0760  3    this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international
B26 0770  1    planning board. If we go into this Common Market, we
B26 0770 11    might just as well stop talking about Constitutional
B26 0780  8    guarantees, Connally Amendments or, for that matter,
B26 0790  6    conservatism in general. @
B26 0800  1       We welcome this able brief for the negative as part
B26 0800 11    of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market
B26 0810  7    which NR will be continuing in our pages.

B26 0860 11    #A PROFESSOR AND THE ARMY#
B26 0870  4    In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably
B26 0880  3    on Active Duty I was not required to participate in
B26 0890  1    any further Army Reserve activities. Now, more than
B26 0890  9    five years later, I cannot in any realistic sense be
B26 0900  8    called a trained soldier. But, in spite of this, I,
B26 0910  6    at present a man 31 years of age and a College Professor,
B26 0920  2    have been recalled "by direction of the President"
B26 0930  1    to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts,
B26 0930 10    for another twelve months of Active Duty as an Sp
B26 0940  9    4 (the equivalent of a PFC). Today, seven years after
B26 0950  6    the date of my initial induction as a draftee, I am
B26 0960  6    Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St.
B26 0970  3    Michael's College. For, after leaving the Army in 1956,
B26 0980  1    I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston
B26 0980 11    College and then at the University of Toronto. This
B26 0990  9    time, added to that which I had already spent in school
B26 1000  7    prior to my induction in 1954, makes a total of twenty-two
B26 1010  6    (22) years of education.
B26 1010 10       The possibility of recall into the Army is part
B26 1020  8    of the price that a modern American has to pay for
B26 1030  5    the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys. With
B26 1040  1    this no loyal citizen can quarrel. However, it seems
B26 1040 10    axiomatic that the government has an obligation "to
B26 1050  7    exercise its mandate reasonably, equitably and with
B26 1060  4    full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably
B26 1070  1    causes". In my own case, I submit that such reasonable
B26 1070 11    and fair exercise is woefully lacking. Taken back into
B26 1080  8    the Army now as an Sp 4, I am leaving 110 college
B26 1090  8    students whose teacher I am. (A wry sidelight on this
B26 1100  5    is that most of my students have deferments from the
B26 1110  2    draft in order to attend my classes.) At this late
B26 1110 12    date, it is impossible for St. Michael's College to
B26 1120  7    find a suitable replacement for me. Even apart from
B26 1130  6    the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life
B26 1140  2    is being totally disrupted for the second time for
B26 1140 11    no very compelling reason- I cannot help looking around
B26 1150  8    at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly
B26 1160  5    on the street corners and in the taverns of every American
B26 1170  4    city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.

B26 1180  3    #MERCENARY: TERM OF HONOR?#
B26 1180  7    In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign
B26 1190  4    volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to
B26 1200  3    as mercenaries. This confuses me no end. If the Hessian
B26 1210  1    troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government
B26 1210 10    to fight for England in the 1770's were mercenaries,
B26 1220  7    what shall we call the UN troops sent to the Congo
B26 1230  6    willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the United
B26 1240  5    Nations? If the UN troops are not mercenaries then
B26 1250  2    the Hessians were not mercenaries either. And if the
B26 1250 11    foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries
B26 1260  8    then Lafayette and von Steuben were mercenaries too,
B26 1270  7    as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille
B26 1280  3    in the early part of World War I and of Chennault's
B26 1290  2    Flying Tigers in the early days of World War II. @

B26 1310  4    It doesn't take a Gore Vidal to tell you what's wrong
B26 1320  3    with Cherokee Textile's slogan ["Pitney-Bowes Objects",

B26 1340  1    Suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment:

B26 1350  8    the modern phrase "move ahead" for the stodgy "keep",

B26 1370  5    (in caps, of course, with the "in spite" as faded as
B26 1380  5    possible), the slogan cannot fail. @
B26 1380 11    #THE IMPENDING DEATH OF POPE#
B26 1390  5    In the issue of March 5, 1960 you had an excellent
B26 1400  2    editorial which said:
B26 1400  5       "On trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian
B26 1410  6    anti-Communist insurgents, U.S. pilot Alan Lawrence
B26 1420  4    Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom
B26 1430  3    fighters, he was actually defending the sovereignty
B26 1430 10    and independence of Indonesia. Facing a prosecution
B26 1440  6    which has demanded the death penalty, he said: 'I have
B26 1450  7    participated in the war against Communism in Korea
B26 1460  4    and at Dienbienphu, and I have helped in the evacuation
B26 1470  1    of North Vietnamese to the free world. I have done
B26 1470 11    all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned
B26 1480  8    and also for the states which have been threatened
B26 1490  5    by Communist domination'. At least in Indonesia, Khrushchev
B26 1500  3    found an American proud to be at total war with Communism"!
B26 1510  2       Since then nothing has happened to save the life
B26 1520  2    of Pope. I found recently a very small article in the
B26 1520 13    New York Times:
B26 1525  3       "U.S. Flier loses Plea. Indonesia Court Upholds
B26 1540  2    Pope's Death Sentence.- Indonesia Military Supreme
B26 1550  1    Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan
B26 1550 10    Lawrence Pope, an American pilot. Pope was convicted
B26 1560  8    last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying
B26 1570  6    bombing missions. He has been in prison since May,
B26 1580  4    1958, when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas.
B26 1590  1    He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency".
B26 1590  9       As we see, Pope may appeal to President Sukarno,
B26 1600  9    Khrushchev's friend, for clemency. This possibility
B26 1610  5    is anything but reassuring.
B26 1620  1       The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on
B26 1620  8    behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters. But who will
B26 1630  6    act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope?
B26 1640  5    Are tractors available for him? Does anybody think
B26 1650  2    of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot?

B26 1660  2    #AN ANALOGY#
B26 1660  4    A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas
B26 1670  1    Liberals were doing to promote "Louis Capet" ["The
B26 1670  9    Week", June 3], another analogy had occurred to me.
B26 1680  9       Consider this table:
B26 1690  3    _1._
B26 1690  4       Louis XIV- FDR. "... With no strong men and no
B26 1700  4    parliament to dispute his will, he was the government".
B26 1710  1    _2._
B26 1710  2       Regency- Truman. "A 'dust-settling' period of decadence
B26 1720  3    and decline".
B26 1720  5    _3._
B26 1720  6       Louis XV- Eisenhower. "... he opened his mouth,
B26 1730  6    said little, and thought not at all".
B26 1740  1    _4._
B26 1740  1       Louis XVI- Kennedy. "... not completely virtuous,
B26 1750  1    but completely incompetent".
B26 1750  4       And Marie Antoinette- Jacqueline Bouvier. "... the
B26 1760  4    beautiful and light-hearted".
B26 1770  1    _5._
B26 1770  1       French Revolution- Conservative Revolution?
B26 1770  5       Truly, that Liberals should choose Louis XIV as
B26 1780  8    a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic,
B26 1790  4    considering the Louis XIV character of their Grand
B26 1800  4    Monarque, FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute
B26 1810  1    power and personal deification, (le roi gouverne par
B26 1810  9    lui meme), but in the disastrous effects of his spending
B26 1820  9    and war policies.
B26 1830  1       In defeating "Louis Capet", John Tower's victory
B26 1830  8    in Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine
B26 1840 10    right of Liberalism.
