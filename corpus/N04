N04 0010  1       "So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return
N04 0010 10    to his village"!
N04 0020  1       "No. Now dammit, I don't want to go into any more
N04 0030  2    explanations. Here comes Jason. Keep this to yourself".
N04 0030 10       Reverend Jason, looking worried, hurried toward
N04 0040  7    us. "Anything wrong, cap'n? The men seem to think so".
N04 0050  9       "Dirion found a large war party south of us. They'll
N04 0060  9    probably attack at dawn", Montero said. He brushed
N04 0070  5    past the clergyman and walked into the center of the
N04 0080  4    camp. Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted, "Fort
N04 0090  1    up! Fort up! There's a large war party on their way"!
N04 0100  1       For a second, engages, cooks, voyageurs appeared
N04 0100  8    struck dumb. Then Little Billy began shouting orders
N04 0110  6    to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and
N04 0120  5    for the cooks to hurry up with the meal. They all flew
N04 0130  3    into action.
N04 0130  5       "That was a terrible thing to do", I said to Oso.
N04 0140  4    The Aricaras treated us like friends. And here all
N04 0150  1    the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles
N04 0150 12    on them! God, what a world you people live in".
N04 0160  8       Oso gave me an unruffled look. "Old Knife's got
N04 0170  5    the largest war party ever seen on the river", he said
N04 0180  3    calmly. "What would you have done in Montero's moccasins?
N04 0190  2    Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people,
N04 0190 13    or would you steer him on someone else"? He shook his
N04 0200 11    head. "Mr. Manuel did that in the war. That's why the
N04 0210 10    British never got the tribes to fight for the King.
N04 0220  7    Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that
N04 0230  5    the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses.
N04 0240  2    Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that
N04 0240 13    the Sioux was goin' to move up. He did that with all
N04 0250 11    the Nations. Hell, they were fightin' each other so
N04 0260  7    hard they had no time for anyone else. The War Department
N04 0270  5    wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero. I
N04 0280  5    saw that letter. He carried it in a little wallet made
N04 0290  1    of fish skin".
N04 0290  4       "But that was war", I said. "There's no war on now".
N04 0300  5       "You're wrong, Matt. In this country there's a war
N04 0310  4    on every time the grass turns green. First it was the
N04 0320  2    Nations against themselves, then it was them against
N04 0320 10    the whites. And it's goin' to go on like this year
N04 0330 10    after year until the white people take over this land".
N04 0340  6       I remember being told it would happen so fast people
N04 0350  5    would think it took place overnight.
N04 0350 11       "That's why this company's important. Once we get
N04 0360  8    over the mountains others will come along. That's why
N04 0370  7    the Trust don't want us to make it. That bastard Chambers!-
N04 0380  6    Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his
N04 0390  7    dirty work! Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet
N04 0400  4    hankerin' for our hair and our goods. Well, talkin'
N04 0410  2    ain't goin' to help- let's fort up"!
N04 0410  9       As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using
N04 0420 12    as protection, I grudgingly found myself agreeing with
N04 0430  5    Oso's logic, especially when I imagined what would
N04 0440  3    have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of
N04 0450  2    screeching warriors had overrun our company.
N04 0450  8       For, unlike the Sioux and the Crows, the Aricaras
N04 0460  8    are not great horsemen, nor are they aggressive like
N04 0470  5    the savage Blackfeet. More of an agricultural nation,
N04 0480  2    they have relied on their warriors only for defense
N04 0480 11    and for survival in the endless wars of the plains.
N04 0490  9    Still, I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with
N04 0500  6    Montero's methods.
N04 0500  8       Surprisingly, he had told the others what he had
N04 0510  9    done. In the brief moment I had to talk to them before
N04 0520  7    I took my post on the ring of defenses, I indicated
N04 0530  2    I was sickened by the methods men employed to live
N04 0530 12    and trade on the river.
N04 0540  4       "I think Montero did right", Amy said firmly. "Let
N04 0550  2    the savages kill each other What do we care"?
N04 0560  1       Reverend Jason was understandably bitter. "It was
N04 0560  8    a terrible thing to do. Those little children ...".
N04 0570  7       But Oso replied calmly, "Trouble ain't easy to dodge
N04 0580  6    out in this country, rev'rend".
N04 0590  1    #28. ATTACK#
N04 0590  3    GRAY EYES ATTACKED OUR camp just as the first pink
N04 0600  2    threads stitched together the hills and the sky. Our
N04 0600 11    camp was in the center of a wide valley. Montero had
N04 0610 10    set up a strong position, using every bale and box
N04 0620  6    we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush.
N04 0630  2    He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified
N04 0630 11    circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked
N04 0650 10    engages the job of trying to keep them steady under
N04 0660  6    fire.
N04 0660  7       The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense; the
N04 0670  6    Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the
N04 0680  4    animals as possible. Wildly bucking horses would make
N04 0680 12    the position difficult to defend against charging warriors.
N04 0690  8       The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd
N04 0700  9    had in a long time, and on Montero's orders had baked
N04 0710  6    enough bread to last the day. Buckets were filled,
N04 0720  3    the herd fed and watered. The worst part had been the
N04 0730  1    waiting; although we didn't expect the attack before
N04 0730  9    dawn, the long cloudy night, filled with the sounds
N04 0740  7    of the industrious insects, seemed endless. Coyotes
N04 0750  3    and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts,
N04 0760  2    the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl.
N04 0760 12    Oso slept unconcernedly, his rifle cradled in his arms;
N04 0770  9    I didn't catch a wink. Every time I closed my eyes,
N04 0780  9    I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife.
N04 0790  5       It was a relief when they finally came.
N04 0800  1       They poured through the opening in the valley, then
N04 0800 10    spread out in a long line to come at us, brandishing
N04 0810  9    their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling
N04 0820  5    scalp cry.
N04 0820  7       "Oso", Montero called "I'll get Gray Eyes".
N04 0830  6       "That'll be a pleasure to see", the big black murmured
N04 0840  7    as he stared down the barrel of his rifle.
N04 0850  3       "Hold your fire", Montero was shouting. "Wait until
N04 0860  2    my shot. I'll shoot the first man who doesn't".
N04 0870  1       I could see them in my sights. They were about a
N04 0870 12    mile off; under me the ground quivered slightly. At
N04 0880  7    first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable
N04 0890  4    faces and bodies, hunched over their horses' heads.
N04 0900  2    Gradually they emerged as men. Gray Eyes was in the
N04 0900 12    lead. His face was split by a vermilion streak, his
N04 0910 10    eyes were pools of white; jagged red and black medicine
N04 0920  6    symbols covered his chest. He was naked except for
N04 0930  4    a clout. Next to him was a young boy I was sure had
N04 0940  2    sat near me at one of the trading sessions. His mouth
N04 0940 13    was open, his neck corded with the strain of his screams.
N04 0950  9    I found his chest in my sights. It had a red circle.
N04 0960  7    The circle came nearer and nearer.
N04 0970  1       My God, how long is he going to wait, I thought
N04 0970 12    ...
N04 0970 13       Montero's rifle cracked. At first I thought he had
N04 0980  9    missed. Gray Eyes remained erect. The feathered lance
N04 0990  6    was still above his head. As he started to slump over,
N04 1000  6    another warrior swung him onto his horse.
N04 1010  1       I squeezed the trigger. At the last second I dropped
N04 1010 11    my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle
N04 1020  9    to the chest of his pony. I saw the pony fall like
N04 1030  7    a stone and the young warrior flew over its head, bouncing
N04 1040  3    like a rubber ball. He started to run but Oso's shot
N04 1050  1    caught him on the wing. He jerked once in the grass
N04 1050 12    and lay still.
N04 1060  1       "If you're goin' to kill 'em- kill 'em"! Oso growled.
N04 1070  2       What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire
N04 1080  1    on all sides. The Aricaras broke under the devastating
N04 1080 10    fire, wheeled and retreated.
N04 1090  3       "Lead up! Lead up! They'll be back"! Montero was
N04 1100  3    shouting.
N04 1100  4       Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling
N04 1110  3    and reorganizing. Out in front of our walls the grass
N04 1120  1    was covered with dead and dying men, war shields, lances,
N04 1120 11    blankets and wounded and dead horses. The morning air
N04 1130  8    was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood,
N04 1140  6    the acrid stench of frightened horses, and the bitterness
N04 1150  4    of burned powder. A horse screamed as it twisted from
N04 1160  1    side to side in a frenzy. A rifle cracked; the square
N04 1160 12    head fell over. One of the warriors suddenly leaped
N04 1170  8    to his feet and began running across the valley to
N04 1180  5    the trees that lined the small creek. His legs pumped
N04 1190  2    furiously, his long black hair streamed out behind
N04 1190 10    him. There was a ragged volley. He was dead before
N04 1200  9    he hit the ground.
N04 1210  1       "For Christ's sake, don't waste your powder on one
N04 1210 10    of 'em"! Montero shouted furiously. "Wait for the charge!
N04 1220  8    The charge, I tell you"!
N04 1230  4       The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint.
N04 1240  2    They grew louder as the Indians charged again. I could
N04 1240 12    see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease,
N04 1250  9    their mouths open, shouting their spine-chilling cries.
N04 1260  6       "Gray Eyes is back", Montero said.
N04 1270  3       The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting
N04 1280  2    to hold his seat. I could see the blood running down
N04 1280 13    his chest. He was riding between two warriors, who
N04 1290  9    held him erect when he started to slump.
N04 1300  4       I forgot to aim. In my sights I watched him looming
N04 1310  3    bigger and bigger. Montero's shot had caught him high
N04 1310 12    in the chest; there was no doubt he was dying. Again
N04 1320 11    we waited for Montero. This time he delayed so long
N04 1330  7    that some of the engages shouted frantically, but they
N04 1340  4    held their fire. The horses were only several lengths
N04 1350  2    away when he fired. The bullet flung Gray Eyes from
N04 1350 12    his horse. Our rolling volley swept most of the other
N04 1360  9    riders from their mounts. But a few reached our wall.
N04 1370  7    I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst
N04 1380  3    apart in a bloody spray. I saw Little Billy rise and
N04 1390  2    fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became
N04 1390 11    shattered flesh and bone. A second leaped from his
N04 1400  9    horse to the top of the bale, firing four arrows in
N04 1410  5    such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they
N04 1420  2    were in flight. Men screamed. Oso reached up, jerked
N04 1420 11    the buck from the bale and snapped his neck. Other
N04 1430  9    Indians were running at the ponies, shrilling and waving
N04 1440  6    blankets. Reverend Jason got one, the Canadians the
N04 1450  4    others. I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the
N04 1460  2    twitching body of the man he had shot, then run back
N04 1460 13    to his position.
N04 1470  1       The ponies were almost uncontrollable. The pall
N04 1470  8    of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the
N04 1480 10    Aricaras charged again. This time more of them hurdled
N04 1490  7    the barrier. A small Indian dived at Montero, who caught
N04 1500  4    him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt. It
N04 1510  2    sounded like a man kicking a melon. Above me a dark
N04 1510 13    rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt
N04 1520 10    to hurdle the bales.
N04 1530  1       Although my shot killed his horse, he rolled off
N04 1530 10    the bale on top of me. I could smell woodsmoke, grease,
N04 1540  7    and oil. His eyes were dark, fluid, fearful, and he
N04 1550  5    gave a sigh as my knife went in. Coming over the wall
N04 1560  2    he had seemed like a hideous devil. Now under me I
N04 1560 13    could see him for what he really was, a boy dressed
N04 1570 10    up in streaks of paint ...
N04 1580  1       The Aricaras made one last desperate charge. It
N04 1580  9    was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors, old
N04 1590  9    and young, wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically
N04 1600  4    from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from
N04 1610  2    their saddles by the relentless slam, slam of the cruelly
N04 1610 12    efficient Hawkinses. Others, badly wounded, gripped
N04 1620  6    hands in manes, knees in bellies, held on as long as
N04 1630  8    possible and then, weak from ghastly wounds, slipped
N04 1640  3    sideways, slowly, almost thoughtfully, to be broken
N04 1640 10    under the slashing hoofs. Some gracefully soared from
N04 1650  8    the backs of their wounded, screaming mounts to make
N04 1660  6    one last defiant charge before the lead split their
N04 1670  4    hearts or tore their guts ...
N04 1670 10       None of them reached our walls again. The few survivors
N04 1680  8    grudgingly turned away. In the distance we could hear
N04 1690  6    the drums and the wail of the death song.
