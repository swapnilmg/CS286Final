J67 0010  1       ANGLO-SAXON and Greek epic each provide on two occasions
J67 0020  1    a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse
J67 0020 10    in the heroic age. Hrothgar's court bard sings of the
J67 0030  8    encounters at Finnsburg (lines 1068-1159), and improvises
J67 0040  5    the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison
J67 0050  4    of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund (lines 871-892);
J67 0060  3    Alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery
J67 0070  1    of Ares and Aphrodite (Odyssey VIII.266-366), and takes
J67 0070 10    up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens
J67 0080 10    on (Odyssey VIII.499-520). Nothing in all this is
J67 0090  8    autobiographical:
J67 0090  9    unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith, the poet of Beowulf
J67 0100 11    is not concerned with his own identity; the poet of
J67 0110 10    the Odyssey, reputed blind, reveals himself not at
J67 0120  7    all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus. Since
J67 0130  3    none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing
J67 0140  1    is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic
J67 0140 10    matter, there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf
J67 0150  7    and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition.
J67 0160  6    That such a tradition lies behind the Iliad and the
J67 0170  5    Odyssey, at least, is hard to deny. Milman Parry rigorously
J67 0180  3    defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems
J67 0190  2    are largely formulaic, and was led to postulate that
J67 0190 11    they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete
J67 0200  8    corpus of Greek epic survived; he further reasoned
J67 0210  4    that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral
J67 0220  2    composition, and assumed the slightly less likely corollary
J67 0230  1    that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas.
J67 0230 11    Proceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one
J67 0240  6    of his schemata, Francis P. Magoun, Jr., argues that
J67 0250  5    Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral
J67 0260  5    formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive
J67 0270  1    generations, and the thesis is striking and compelling.
J67 0270  9    Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment:
J67 0280  7    Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic
J67 0290  9    to the same extent.
J67 0300  1       The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated
J67 0300 12    only by a very skilful oral poet, but it appears safe
J67 0310  9    to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could
J67 0320  5    be composed without extreme difficulty, even in a language
J67 0330  4    of many terminal inflections. Assonance seems nearly
J67 0340  1    as severe a curb, although in a celebrated passage
J67 0340 10    William of Malmesbury declares that a Song of Roland
J67 0350  7    was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings.
J67 0360  4    The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter
J67 0370  3    probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse of
J67 0380  2    Beowulf or of the Iliad and the Odyssey was not easy
J67 0390  1    to create but was not impossible for poets who had
J67 0390 11    developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood.
J67 0400  6    Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary
J67 0410  5    for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause.
J67 0420  3    The poet in a written tradition who generally never
J67 0420 12    blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without
J67 0430 12    incurring blame. But the oral poet cannot pause; he
J67 0440  8    must improvise continuously with no apparent effort.
J67 0450  5    Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great
J67 0460  3    as the writing poet can manage, it is still great enough
J67 0460 14    for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has
J67 0470 10    aids to facilitate rapid composition. The Germanic
J67 0480  4    poet had such aids in the kennings, which provided
J67 0490  2    for the difficulties of alliteration; the Homeric poet
J67 0500  1    had epithets, which provided for recurring needs in
J67 0500  9    the hexameter. Either poet could quickly and easily
J67 0510  6    select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements
J67 0520  4    as he chanted out his lines, because the kennings and
J67 0530  2    the epithets made possible the construction of systems
J67 0530 10    of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper
J67 0540  8    nouns. Other synonyms could of course serve the same
J67 0550  7    function, and for the sake of ease I shall speak of
J67 0560  4    kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble
J67 0570  1    sense, and name, for example, Gar-Dene a kenning for
J67 0570 11    the Danes. Verbal and adverbial elements too participated
J67 0580  7    in each epic diction, but it is for the present sufficient
J67 0590  8    to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of
J67 0600  4    semantic near-equivalents, and to designate the members
J67 0610  2    of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the
J67 0610 12    poetic language. Limited to a few thousand lines of
J67 0620  9    heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic
J67 0630  6    dialects, we cannot say how frequently the kennings
J67 0640  3    in Beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same
J67 0650  1    soil. But we can say that since a writing poet, with
J67 0650 12    leisure before him, would seem unlikely to invent a
J67 0660  8    technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution,
J67 0670  3    the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed
J67 0680  3    to an oral tradition.
J67 0680  7       One of the greatest Homerists of our time, Frederick
J67 0690  6    M. Combellack, argues that when it is assumed the Iliad
J67 0700  6    and the Odyssey are oral poems, the postulated single
J67 0710  3    redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with
J67 0720  1    or denied originality in choice of phrasing. Any example
J67 0720 10    of grand or exquisite diction may have been created
J67 0730  8    by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two
J67 0740  5    works we possess or may be due to one of his completely
J67 0760  1    unknown fellow-craftsmen. The quest of the historical
J67 0760  9    Homer is likely never to have further success; no individual
J67 0770 10    word in the Iliad or the Odyssey can be credited to
J67 0780  9    any one man; no strikingly effective element of speech
J67 0790  5    in the extant poems can with assurance be said not
J67 0800  4    to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus
J67 0810  1    that may have existed at the beginning of the first
J67 0810 11    millennium before Christ. This observation is of interest
J67 0820  7    not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students
J67 0830  5    of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well. To the extent that a
J67 0840  4    tale is twice told, its final author must be suspect,
J67 0840 14    although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a
J67 0850  9    misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi.
J67 0860  4       Combellack argues further, and here he makes his
J67 0870  4    main point, that once the Iliad and the Odyssey are
J67 0880  2    thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed
J67 0880 10    to formulaic poetry, Homeric critics are deprived of
J67 0890  8    an entire domain they previously found arable. With
J67 0900  5    a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions,
J67 0910  2    no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context,
J67 0920  2    because each was very probably the only expression
J67 0920 10    that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation
J67 0930  7    would allow. Words or phrases that connoisseurs have
J67 0940  6    admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore
J67 0950  4    lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers,
J67 0960  3    sometimes accurate and sometimes not. This observation
J67 0970  1    too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry. To the
J67 0970 11    extent that a language is formulaic, its individual
J67 0980  7    components must be regarded as no more distinguished
J67 0990  5    than other cliches.
J67 0990  8       W. F. Bryan suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf
J67 1000  7    were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes
J67 1010  5    for ironic inappropriateness, but such a view would
J67 1020  5    appear untenable unless it is denied that the language
J67 1030  1    of Beowulf is formulaic. If the master of scops who
J67 1030 11    was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings
J67 1040  8    that were traditional, he was at least partly deprived
J67 1050  6    of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated
J67 1060  3    misuse of speech elements. Once many significant phrases
J67 1070  2    are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide
J67 1070 12    for prosodic necessity, they are not to be defended
J67 1080  9    for their semantic properties in isolated contexts.
J67 1090  4    It is false to be certain of having discovered in the
J67 1100  3    language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony.
J67 1110  1       Yet, if the argument is turned awry, there may be
J67 1110 11    found a great deal in Bryan's view, after all. A formulaic
J67 1120 10    element need not be held meaningless merely because
J67 1130  6    it was selected with little conscious reflection. Time-servers
J67 1140  4    though the periphrastic expressions are, they may nevertheless
J67 1150  4    be handsome or ironic or humorous. A long evolution
J67 1160  1    in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of
J67 1160 10    the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show
J67 1170  9    the important qualities of things, and these formulas
J67 1180  4    are therefore potentially rather than always actually
J67 1190  1    accurate. True, we do not know how they were regarded
J67 1190 11    in their day, but we need not believe the epic audience
J67 1200 10    to have been more insensitive to the formulas than
J67 1210  5    the numerous scholars of modern times who have read
J67 1220  3    Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still
J67 1220 12    found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the
J67 1230  9    most familiar phrases. Nouns and adjectives in a written
J67 1240  7    tradition are chosen for the nonce; in an oral tradition
J67 1250  5    they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus, and
J67 1260  2    tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation.
J67 1270  1    Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological
J67 1270 11    particulars in an oral poem; no-one today would hope
J67 1280 10    to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the
J67 1290  6    palace of Priam. A ship at dry-dock could be called
J67 1300  4    a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship
J67 1310  2    in Greek. Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes
J67 1310 11    would be Gar-Dene (as their king is Hrothgar) and Priam
J67 1320 10    would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s. Achilles, like Siegfried
J67 1330  4    in the Nibelungenlied, is potentially the swiftest
J67 1340  5    of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even
J67 1350  6    when he stands idle. In Coriolanus the agnomen of Marcius
J67 1360  5    is used deliberately and pointedly, but the Homeric
J67 1370  2    epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually
J67 1370 11    and recall to the hearer "a familiar story or situation
J67 1380 10    or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent". The
J67 1390  7    epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet;
J67 1400  6    it was partly his master. The poet's intentions are
J67 1410  3    difficult to discern and, except to biographers, unimportant;
J67 1420  1    the language, however, is a proper object of scrutiny,
J67 1420 10    and the effects of the language are palpable even if
J67 1430  9    sometimes inevitable.
J67 1440  1       Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions.
J67 1440  9    Yet they are written; at some stage in their evolution
J67 1450 10    they were transcribed. Albert B. Lord suggests that
J67 1460  6    the Homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel
J67 1470  7    who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did
J67 1480  3    not himself possess the knowledge of writing since
J67 1480 11    it would be useless to his guild, and Magoun argues
J67 1500  9    that the Beowulf poet and Cynewulf may have dictated
J67 1510  7    their verse in the same fashion. This explanation is
J67 1520  4    attractive, but is vitiated at least in part by the
J67 1530  2    observation that Cynewulf, though he used kennings
J67 1530  9    in the traditional manner, was a literate man who four
J67 1540  8    times inscribed his name by runes into his works. If
J67 1550  5    Cynewulf was literate, the Beowulf poet may have been
J67 1560  4    also, and so may the final redactor of the Iliad and
J67 1570  1    the Odyssey. In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind
J67 1570 11    or illiterate bard, one may conceive of a man who heard
J67 1580 10    a vast store of oral poetry recited, and became intimately
J67 1590  5    familiar with the established aids to poetizing, and
J67 1600  4    himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of
J67 1610  1    the compositions of the past. Other theories of origin
J67 1610 10    are compatible with the formulaic theory: Beowulf may
J67 1620  7    contain a design for terror, and the Iliad may have
J67 1630  7    a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic
J67 1640  4    pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery.
J67 1650  2    The account of the growth and final transcription of
J67 1650 11    these epics rests partly, however, upon the degree
J67 1660  8    to which they were formulaic.
J67 1670  1       Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines
J67 1670  8    repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems, and by increasing
J67 1680 10    this figure so as to include lines repeated with very
J67 1690  8    slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines
J67 1700  4    used a total of 5612 times. Thus one line in five from
J67 1710  3    the Iliad and the Odyssey is to be found somewhere
J67 1720  1    else in the two poems. The ratio is thoroughly remarkable,
J67 1720 11    because the lines are so long- half again as long as
J67 1730 10    those of Beowulf. Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have
J67 1740  5    no comparable amount of repetition; there is no reason
J67 1750  5    to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines
J67 1760  1    and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric
J67 1760 11    colleague. In determining the extent to which any poem
J67 1770  9    is formulaic it is idle, however, to inspect nothing
J67 1780  5    besides lines repeated in their entirety, for a stock
J67 1790  4    of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the
J67 1790 13    poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided
J67 1800  8    for prosodic needs. The closest scrutiny is owed to
J67 1810  7    the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets;
J67 1820  2    if any words or phrases are formulaic, they will be.
J67 1830  1       The Iliad has two words for the shield, |a|s|p|i|s
J67 1840  1    and |s|a|k|o|s.
