J13 0010  1       Some of the features of the top portions of Figure
J13 0010 11    1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1.
J13 0020  8    First, the Onset Profile spreads across approximately
J13 0030  4    12 years for boys and 10 years for girls. In contrast,
J13 0040  3    20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile (excluding
J13 0050  1    center 5 for boys and 4 for girls) are bunched and
J13 0050 12    extend over a much shorter period, approximately 30
J13 0060  6    months for boys and 40 months for girls. The Maturity
J13 0070  4    Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset
J13 0080  2    is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas
J13 0080 11    Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of
J13 0090  9    adolescence. Second, for both sexes, the 21 transverse
J13 0100  6    lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual
J13 0110  3    spread than those in the Completion Profile. Although
J13 0120  1    the standard deviation values on which spread of the
J13 0120 10    lines are based are relatively larger for those centers
J13 0130  7    which begin to ossify early (Table 1), there are considerable
J13 0140  6    differences in this value between centers having the
J13 0160  4    closely timed Onsets. Third, the process of calcification
J13 0170  1    is seen to begin later and to continue much longer
J13 0170 11    for these boys than for the girls, a fact which confirms
J13 0180 10    data for other groups of children.
J13 0190  2       The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed
J13 0200  1    to serve as norms for children. It is convenient to
J13 0200 11    classify a child's onset ages and completion ages as
J13 0210  9    "advanced", "moderate" (modal), or "delayed" according
J13 0220  5    to whether the child's age equivalent "dots" appeared
J13 0230  5    to the left of, upon, or to the right of the appropriate
J13 0240  7    short transverse line. When a dot appears close to
J13 0250  4    the end of the transverse line, the "moderate" rating
J13 0260  2    may be further classified according to the position
J13 0260 10    of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting
J13 0270  8    the mean age. Such classifications may be called "somewhat
J13 0280  5    advanced" or "somewhat delayed", as the case may be,
J13 0290  6    reserving "moderate" for dots upon or close to the
J13 0300  3    mean.
J13 0300  4       In the lower portion of each Chart, the Skeletal
J13 0310  1    Age (Hand) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified.
J13 0320  1    There the middle one of the three curves denotes "mean
J13 0320 11    Skeletal Age" for the Maturity Series boys and girls.
J13 0330  8    The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard
J13 0340  6    deviation, and the lower curve represents the mean
J13 0350  3    minus one standard deviation. Thus, a child's Skeletal
J13 0360  1    Age "dots" may be classified as "advanced" when they
J13 0360 10    appear above the middle curve, "moderate" when they
J13 0370  7    appear immediately above or below the middle curve,
J13 0380  6    and "delayed" when they appear below the lower curve.
J13 0390  4       To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity
J13 0400  1    Chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity
J13 0400  9    norms which show two quite different methods of depicting
J13 0410  8    developmental level of growth centers. First, the upper
J13 0420  7    portion requires series of films for every child, consisting
J13 0430  5    of those from Hand, Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, and Foot.
J13 0440  3    The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand.
J13 0450  1    Second, the upper portion permits comparison of maturity
J13 0450  9    levels of an equal number of growth centers from the
J13 0460  8    long, short, and round bones of the five regions. The
J13 0470  6    lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels
J13 0480  2    of short and round bones predominantly, since only
J13 0480 10    two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a
J13 0490  9    region. Third, the upper portion deals with only two
J13 0500  5    indicators of developmental level, Onset and Completion.
J13 0510  2    The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate
J13 0520  1    maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as
J13 0520 10    their Onset and Completion. Fourth, the two indicators
J13 0530  7    are for the most part widely separated chronologically,
J13 0540  4    with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood
J13 0550  3    for all but one growth center. The lower portion provides
J13 0560  1    a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.
J13 0560 10       Onsets, Completions, and Skeletal Ages (Hand) of
J13 0570  7    boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified,
J13 0580  7    using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately
J13 0590  4    below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile.
J13 0600  2    It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to
J13 0600 12    selection of growth centers from specific regions of
J13 0610  8    the body will be small, according to existing tables
J13 0620  5    of onset age and completion age for centers throughout
J13 0630  3    the body. Accordingly, maturity level ratings by means
J13 0640  2    of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart,
J13 0640 12    respectively, should be somewhat similar since Skeletal
J13 0650  7    Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy
J13 0660  5    and upon Completions during adolescence. It is clear
J13 0670  4    that there are some differences in the ratings, but
J13 0680  1    there is substantial agreement. Since a Skeletal Age
J13 0680  9    rating can be made at any age during growth, from Elbow,
J13 0690 10    Shoulder, Knee, or Foot as well as Hand, it seems to
J13 0700  8    be the method of choice when one wishes to study most
J13 0710  4    aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood.
J13 0720  1    As stated earlier in the paper, Onsets and Completions-
J13 0730  1    particularly the former- provide a different tool or
J13 0730  9    indicator of expectancy in osseous development, each
J13 0740  5    within a limited age period. Such an indicator, or
J13 0750  4    indicators, are needed as means of recognizing specific
J13 0760  1    periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress.
J13 0760  8       It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study
J13 0770 10    was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset
J13 0780  5    and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat
J13 0790  3    beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2.
J13 0800  2    As one approach to doing this, Figures 3 and 4 have
J13 0800 13    been constructed from the mean ages and the individual
J13 0810  8    onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2. The
J13 0820  7    differences between onset age and completion age with
J13 0830  2    respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought
J13 0830 11    into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows.
J13 0840  8    The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3, and for girl
J13 0850  7    2 in Figure 4. The numbering system used in Tables
J13 0860  3    1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21
J13 0860 16    growth centers.
J13 0870  2       The "dot" on one end of each arrow indicates extent
J13 0880  2    of difference in months between the child's onset age
J13 0880 11    and the corresponding mean age for the growth center.
J13 0890  8    The "tip" of the arrow represents extent of difference
J13 0900  6    between the child's completion age and the corresponding
J13 0910  5    mean age for the growth center. Thus, the alignment
J13 0920  2    of the "dots" and "tips", respectively, indicate individual
J13 0930  1    variability of the 21 growth centers of each child
J13 0930 10    with respect to the mean values for these boys and
J13 0940  9    girls. The direction in which the arrow points shows
J13 0950  5    how the maturity level of the growth center was changed
J13 0960  2    at Completion from the level at Onset. When the "dot"
J13 0970  1    and "tip" coincide, the classification used in this
J13 0970  9    paper is "same schedule". The length of the arrow indicates
J13 0980  8    amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over
J13 0990  5    that at Onset, and the difference in months can be
J13 1000  5    read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale
J13 1010  1    along the base of each figure, or more precisely by
J13 1010 11    referring to the original data in the appropriate tables.
J13 1020  7       The difference between the sequence of Onset of
J13 1030  6    ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence
J13 1040  2    in Figures 3 and 4. This difference is readily clarified
J13 1050  1    by referring to Table 1. For example, arrow 17 in Figure
J13 1050 12    3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34,
J13 1060  8    whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed
J13 1070  6    by arrow 18 in Figure 4. For the boy, this epiphysis
J13 1080  3    was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at
J13 1080 13    Completion. Thus, the Span of its ossification was
J13 1090  8    shortened and the center's ability to "catch up" in
J13 1100  6    ossification is demonstrated. In contrast, for the
J13 1110  4    girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and
J13 1120  2    delayed at Completion. Obviously, the slowing for her
J13 1120 10    may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion.
J13 1130  9    The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure
J13 1140  9    2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during
J13 1150  5    the prepubescent period. Length of the shaft of these
J13 1160  3    arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation
J13 1170  1    values for each center in Table 1.
J13 1170  8       We have attempted to simplify the extensive task
J13 1180  4    of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each
J13 1190  2    child- more than 1700 values for the entire group-
J13 1190 11    by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers
J13 1200  8    so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls
J13 1210  7    will appear together for each growth center. Figures
J13 1220  2    5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the
J13 1220 13    results for each growth center. Forty other figures
J13 1230  7    similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the
J13 1240  6    construction of all figures and tables in this monograph
J13 1250  2    have been included in the Appendix.
J13 1250  8       The principles used in making each arrow for Figures
J13 1260  8    3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures
J13 1270  4    5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix. One
J13 1280  2    growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the
J13 1280 12    second finger- was chosen as an example for discussion
J13 1290  8    here, primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion,
J13 1300  4    the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short
J13 1310  5    bones, occurs in this center for girls near the menarche
J13 1320  2    and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage.
J13 1320 10    Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity
J13 1330  8    indicators to include in studies of growth, dietary
J13 1340  6    patterns, and health during adolescence.
J13 1350  1       The following summary, based on Figures 5 and 6,
J13 1350 10    is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures
J13 1360 10    constructed from onset ages and completion ages of
J13 1370  6    individual children with respect to the appropriate
J13 1380  2    mean age for each growth center. At the top of Figure
J13 1380 13    5, for example, the Onset range and Completion range
J13 1390  9    lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn
J13 1400  6    for girls according to their mean and standard deviation
J13 1410  3    values in Table 1. The 34 arrows, denoting onset age
J13 1420  2    plus completion age deviations, have been arrayed in
J13 1420 10    an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had
J13 1430  9    the earliest Onset of the 34 girls. The growth center
J13 1440  6    depicted here, in the distal phalanx of the second
J13 1450  2    finger, is listed as the fifth of those in the seven
J13 1450 13    short bones. The mean onset age was 25.3 months (Table
J13 1460  9    1), and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133
J13 1470  8    months. The correlation (Table 2) between onset age
J13 1490  4    and completion age was +.50, and that between onset
J13 1500  1    age and Span was -.10. With due consideration for the
J13 1500 12    limits of precision in assessing, expected rate of
J13 1510  6    change in ossification of girls age 2 years, and the
J13 1520  5    known variations in rate of ossification of these children
J13 1530  2    as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement,
J13 1530 11    each arrow with a "shaft length" of four months or
J13 1540 10    less was selected as indicating "same schedule" at
J13 1550  5    Onset and Completion, for this particular epiphysis.
J13 1560  2    Accordingly, girls 31, 29, 33, 21, 26, 13, 3, 4, 14,
J13 1570  2    32, 24, 25, 34, 23, 6, 15, 22, and 16 may be said to
J13 1570 16    have the "same schedule" at Onset and Completion.
J13 1580  6       It seems clear, from the counter-balanced shape
J13 1590  5    of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was
J13 1600  3    about an equal number of early and late Onsets and
J13 1600 13    Completions for the 34 girls. Accordingly, if
J13 1610  7    epiphyseal-diaphyseal
J13 1610  9    fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche, early
J13 1620  8    and late menarches might have been forecast rather
J13 1630  5    precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for
J13 1640  2    the 18 girls with "same schedule". As an example of
J13 1640 12    the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which
J13 1650  8    exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction
J13 1660  4    with its position in the figure: girl 2 had a delayed
J13 1670  3    Onset and further delayed Completion. It is of interest
J13 1680  1    that her menarche was somewhat later than the average
J13 1680 10    for the girls in this group.
J13 1690  4       A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would
J13 1700  2    necessitate quite a different conclusion about the
J13 1700  9    predictive value of onset age in forecasting their
J13 1710  7    attainment of the pubescent stage. Boys 32, 23, 31,
J13 1720  5    17, 30, 19, and 24 had "same schedule" at Onset and
J13 1730  2    Completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent
J13 1730  9    stage would appear possible for only seven boys. Boy
J13 1740  9    34, like girl 2, did not have "same schedule"; his
J13 1750  5    arrow crosses the line denoting the mean. The "dot"
J13 1760  4    on his arrow indicates early Onset and the "tip" indicates
J13 1770  2    relatively later Completion.
J13 1770  5       After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures
J13 1780  6    5 and 6, classifications of the onset ages and completion
J13 1790  4    ages were summarized from them.
