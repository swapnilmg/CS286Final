J58 0010  1       During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned
J58 0010  9    the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the
J58 0020  9    principles of the Declaration of Independence. During
J58 0030  4    the Brown trial, however, the state's most powerful
J58 0040  3    Democratic newspaper, the Providence Daily Post, stated
J58 0050  2    that Brown was a murderer, a man of blood, and that
J58 0050 13    he and his associates, with the assistance of Republicans
J58 0060  8    and Abolitionists, had plotted not only the liberation
J58 0070  7    of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal
J58 0080  5    governments. The Providence Daily Journal answered
J58 0090  2    the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown
J58 0100  2    was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and
J58 0100 10    that "He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican
J58 0110  9    Party, who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles
J58 0120  7    that they do not interfere with slavery in the states".
J58 0130  6    The two major newspapers in Providence continued, throughout
J58 0140  3    the crisis, to accuse each other of misrepresenting
J58 0150  1    the facts and attempting to falsify history.
J58 0150  8       While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans
J58 0160  7    and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats,
J58 0170  5    the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia
J58 0180  4    authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn
J58 0190  4    Brown and his men. Editor Foss stated, "Of their guilt
J58 0200  2    ... there can be no doubt ... but they are entitled
J58 0200 13    to sufficient time to prepare for trial, and ... a
J58 0210  9    fair trial". The Providence Daily Post thought that
J58 0220  5    there were probably good reasons for the haste in which
J58 0230  5    the trial was being conducted and that the only thing
J58 0240  1    gained by a delay would be calmer feelings. The Providence
J58 0240 11    Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown
J58 0250  9    was evident, the South must guarantee him a fair trial
J58 0260  8    to preserve domestic peace.
J58 0270  1       On October 31, 1859, John Brown was found guilty
J58 0270 10    of treason against the state of Virginia, inciting
J58 0280  7    slave rebellion, and murder. For these crimes he was
J58 0290  6    sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday, December
J58 0300  2    2, 1859. Upon receiving the news, Northern writers,
J58 0300 10    editors, and clergymen heaped accusations of murder
J58 0310  7    on the Southern states, particularly Virginia.
J58 0320  3       Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the
J58 0330  3    state elections, they watched John Brown's trial with
J58 0340  1    extreme interest. On Wednesday morning, November 2,
J58 0340  8    1859, the Providence Daily Journal stated that although
J58 0350  6    Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty, no man,
J58 0360  6    however criminal, ought to suffer the penalty without
J58 0370  2    a fairer trial. The editor's main criticism of the
J58 0370 11    trial was the haste with which it was conducted. The
J58 0380 10    readers of the Providence Daily Post, however, learned
J58 0390  5    that it was generally conceded that "Old Brown" had
J58 0400  5    a fair trial. Concerning the sentence the editor asked,
J58 0410  4    "What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who
J58 0411  2    have defied her laws, organized treason, and butchered
J58 0420  8    her citizens".
J58 0430  1       In the eastern section of the state the newspapers'
J58 0430 10    reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically
J58 0440  8    identical. J. Wheaton Smith, editor of the Warren Telegraph
J58 0450  8    stated that "the ends of justice must be satisfied,
J58 0460  7    a solitary example must be set, in order that all those
J58 0470  6    misnamed philantropists [sic], who, actuated by a blind
J58 0480  4    zeal, dare to instigate riot, treason, and murder,
J58 0480 12    may heed it and shape their future course accordingly".
J58 0490  9    The editor of the Newport Advertiser could discover
J58 0500  6    no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown
J58 0510  5    trial which would warrant making an exception to the
J58 0520  3    infliction of capital punishment.
J58 0520  7       In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island editors,
J58 0530  7    Samuel S. Foss of the Woonsocket Patriot outwardly
J58 0540  3    condemned the trial as being completely unfair. Concerning
J58 0550  3    the sentence, Foss wrote, "If it be possible ... that
J58 0560  3    mercy shall override vengeance ... and that John Brown's
J58 0570  1    sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment, it would
J58 0570  9    be well- well for the country ... and for Virginia".
J58 0580  8       Despite the excitement being caused by the trial
J58 0590  6    and sentence of John Brown, Rhode Islanders turned
J58 0600  2    their attention to the state elections. The state had
J58 0610  1    elected Republican candidates in the past two years.
J58 0610  9    There was no doubt as to the control the Republican
J58 0620  7    party exercised throughout the state. If it failed
J58 0630  5    on occasion to elect its candidates for general state
J58 0640  1    offices by majorities, the failure was due to a lingering
J58 0640 11    remnant of the Know-Nothing party, which called itself
J58 0650  9    the American Republican party. The American Republicans
J58 0660  5    and the Republicans both nominated Lieutenant-Governor
J58 0670  3    Turner for governor. Elisha R. Potter was the Democratic
J58 0680  4    candidate. The results of the election of 1859 found
J58 0690  2    Republican candidates not only winning the offices
J58 0690  9    of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining
J58 0700  7    the two Congressional offices from the eastern and
J58 0710  5    western sections of the state.
J58 0710 10       During the month of November hardly a day passed
J58 0720  9    when there was not some mention of John Brown in the
J58 0730  6    Rhode Island newspapers. On November 7, 1859, the Providence
J58 0740  5    Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown
J58 0750  4    from "E. B.", a Quaker lady in Newport. In reference
J58 0760  2    to Brown's raid she wrote, "though we are non-resistants
J58 0770  1    and religiously believe it better to reform by moral
J58 0770 10    and not by carnal weapons ... we know thee was anemated
J58 0780  8    [sic] by the most generous and philanthropic motives".
J58 0790  4    "E. B." compared John Brown to Moses in that they were
J58 0800  7    both acting to deliver millions from oppression. In
J58 0810  3    contrast to "E. B.", most Rhode Islanders hardly thought
J58 0820  3    of John Brown as being another Moses. Most attempts
J58 0830  1    to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found
J58 0830 11    an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island.
J58 0840  5       On Wednesday evening, November 23, 1859, in Warren,
J58 0850  5    Rev. Mark Trafton of New Bedford, gave a "Mission of
J58 0860  4    Sympathy" lecture in which he favorably viewed the
J58 0870  1    Harper's Ferry insurrection. The Warren Telegraph stated
J58 0880  1    that many of Rev. Trafton's remarks were inappropriate
J58 0880  9    and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism.
J58 0890  6    In its account of the Trafton lecture, the Providence
J58 0900  4    Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. Trafton made
J58 0920  4    the people indignant.
J58 0920  7       No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found
J58 0930  6    in the Providence Daily Post, for the editor claimed
J58 0940  5    that there were a score of men in the state prison
J58 0950  1    who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy.
J58 0950 10    The Providence Daily Journal, however, stated that
J58 0960  6    Brown's courage, bravery, and heroism "in a good cause
J58 0980  7    would make a man a martyr; it gives something of dignity
J58 0990  4    even to a bad one". The Woonsocket Patriot admitted
J58 1000  2    that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment
J58 1010  1    "but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or
J58 1010 13    James Buchanan". The Newport Mercury exhibited more
J58 1020  7    concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making
J58 1030  7    a martyr of Brown than it did over the development
J58 1040  5    of sympathy for him.
J58 1040  9       In her letter to John Brown, "E. B.", the Quakeress
J58 1050  8    from Newport, had suggested that the American people
J58 1060  6    owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the
J58 1070  5    slaves than they did to George Washington. During the
J58 1080  2    latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution,
J58 1090  1    it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in
J58 1090 11    "E. B.'s" suggestion. On November 22, 1859, the Providence
J58 1100  8    Daily Journal stated that although Brown's "pluck"
J58 1120  6    and honest fanaticism must be admired, any honor paid
J58 1130  7    to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate
J58 1140  3    his actions. A week later the Daily Journal had discovered
J58 1160  2    the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold
J58 1160 11    a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution.
J58 1170 11    The editor of the Daily Journal warned, "... that if
J58 1180  9    such a demonstration be made, it will not find support
J58 1190  8    or countenance from any of the men whose names are
J58 1200  4    recognized as having a right to speak for Providence".
J58 1210  1    The Providence Daily Post's editor wrote that he could
J58 1220  1    not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be
J58 1230 10    held in Providence. He further called upon the people
J58 1240  7    of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace.
J58 1250  4       On December 2, 1859, John Brown was hanged at Charles
J58 1260  4    Town, Virginia. Extraordinary precautions were taken
J58 1270  2    so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen
J58 1270 14    within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold. In many
J58 1280  8    Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church
J58 1290  7    bells were tolled. Such was not the case in Rhode Island.
J58 1300  6    The only public demonstration in honor of John Brown
J58 1310  4    was held at Pratt's Hall in Providence, on the day
J58 1320  2    of his execution.
J58 1320  5       Despite the opposition of the city newspapers, the
J58 1330  2    Pratt Hall meeting "brought together a very respectable
J58 1340  1    audience, composed in part of those who had been distinguished
J58 1340 11    for years for their radical views upon the subject
J58 1350  8    of slavery, of many of our colored citizens, and of
J58 1360  5    those who were attracted to the place by the novelty
J58 1370  2    of such a gathering". Seated on the platform were Amos
J58 1370 12    C. Barstow, ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican
J58 1380 10    stove manufacturer; Thomas Davis, an uncompromising
J58 1390  6    Garrisonian; the Reverend Augustus Woodbury, a Unitarian
J58 1400  6    minister; the Reverend George T. Day, a Free-Will Baptist;
J58 1410  8    Daniel w. Vaughan, and William H. H. Clements. The
J58 1420  7    latter two were appointed secretaries. The first speaker
J58 1430  4    was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen
J58 1440  2    president of the meeting. He spoke of his desire to
J58 1440 12    promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means
J58 1450  8    and he compared John Brown of Harper's Ferry to the
J58 1460  7    John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period. Barstow
J58 1470  4    concluded that as Rhode Island's John Brown became
J58 1480  3    a canonized hero, if not a saint, so would it be with
J58 1490  1    John Brown of Harper's Ferry.
J58 1490  6       The next speaker was George T. Day. Although admitting
J58 1500  5    Brown's guilt on legal grounds, Day said that, "Brown
J58 1510  5    is no common criminal; his deed was not below, but
J58 1520  3    above the law". Following Day was Woodbury who spoke
J58 1530  7    of his disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection,
J58 1540  8    his admiration of Brown's character, and his opposition
J58 1550  7    to slavery. Woodbury's remarks were applauded by a
J58 1560  6    portion of the audience several times and once there
J58 1570  4    was hissing.
J58 1570  6       The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis. By
J58 1580  3    this time large numbers of the audience had left the
J58 1590  1    hall. Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to
J58 1590 10    the general feeling of opposition which the meeting
J58 1600  6    had encountered from many of the citizens and all the
J58 1610  5    newspapers of the city. He said that the propriety
J58 1620  1    or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that
J58 1620 11    was to be settled by every man in accordance with the
J58 1630  8    convictions of private judgments. In the remainder
J58 1640  4    of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown
J58 1650  2    and warned those who took part in the meeting that
J58 1650 12    they "are liable to the charge that they are supporting
J58 1660  9    traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned".
J58 1670  7    He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to
J58 1680  5    the state's condemnation of a man (Thomas W. Dorr)
J58 1690  2    proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the
J58 1690 11    law of the land and the principles of human liberty.
J58 1700 10    At the close of Davis' speech the following preamble
J58 1710  5    and resolutions were read by the president, and on
J58 1720  3    the question of their adoption passed unanimously:
J58 1730  1       Whereas, John Brown has cheerfully risked his life
J58 1730  9    in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all
J58 1750  8    rights ... and is this day doomed to suffer death for
J58 1760  5    his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper:
J58 1770  1    Therefore,
J58 1770  2       Resolved that, while we most decidedly disapprove
J58 1780  1    the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects, yet
J58 1780 10    ... in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause
J58 1790 10    of human freedom, we still recognize the qualities
J58 1800  4    of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which
J58 1810  2    true men have always admired and which history never
J58 1810 11    fails to honor.
J58 1820  3       Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas,
J58 1830  1    occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who
J58 1830 10    were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory,
J58 1840  8    call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts
J58 1850  6    in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he
J58 1860  4    had suffered, and commend his family to the special
J58 1870  1    sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence
J58 1870 11    justice.
J58 1880  1       Resolved ... that the anti-slavery sentiment is
J58 1880  9    becoming ripe for resolute action.
J58 1890  3       Resolved, that we find in this fearful tragedy at
J58 1900  2    Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to
J58 1900 11    remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily
J58 1910 10    as possible ...
J58 1920  1       On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting
J58 1920  9    the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that
J58 1930  6    although the meeting was milder and less extreme than
J58 1940  6    those held in other areas for similar purposes, it
J58 1950  2    could have been avoided completely.
