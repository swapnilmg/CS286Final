E21 0010  2    MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning.
E21 0020  1    This is particularly true in site selection. You must
E21 0020 10    know before you start what the needs and objectives
E21 0030  8    of your organtion are; you must have a list of requirements
E21 0040  7    on where, how many, and what type sites are needed.
E21 0050  3    With such a program you can make constructive selections
E21 0060  1    of the best sites available.
E21 0060  6       Begin the examination of a site with a good map
E21 0070  5    and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more
E21 0080  1    and more available through the work of counties and
E21 0080 10    other government agencies. The new editions of topographic
E21 0090  7    maps being made by the federal government are excellent
E21 0100  4    for orienting yourself to the natural features of the
E21 0110  4    site. These are inexpensive and available from the
E21 0110 12    U. S. Geological Society, Washington 25, D. C. In
E21 0120  9    recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service
E21 0130 10    have taken aerial photos which show features in detail
E21 0140  8    and are very good for planning use. Most counties also
E21 0150  5    have maps available from the county engineer showing
E21 0160  2    roads and other features and from the assessor's office
E21 0170  1    showing ownerships of land.
E21 0170  5       Inspect the site in the field during the time of
E21 0180  4    the year when the area will be most heavily used for
E21 0190  1    recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to
E21 0190  9    get the feel of the climate conditions, the exposure
E21 0200  5    to the sun and wind, the water interests, etcetera,
E21 0210  2    which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually
E21 0210 11    helpful to make a sketch map in the field, showing
E21 0220 10    the size and location of the features of interest and
E21 0230  7    to take photographs at the site. These are a great
E21 0240  4    aid for planning use back at the office.
E21 0240 12    ##
E21 0240 13    FOR SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified
E21 0250 11    and experienced park planner to carry through the study.
E21 0260  8    However, there is also much to be gained by making
E21 0270  6    use of the abilities of the local people who are available
E21 0280  2    and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners,
E21 0290  1    engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in
E21 0290  9    the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge
E21 0300  7    regarding the site or opinions to offer from their
E21 0310  5    varied professional experiences. A visit to the site
E21 0320  1    by a group of several persons can usually bring out
E21 0320 11    new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning
E21 0330  7    study of any recreation area.
E21 0340  1       How much study is required? This, of course, depends
E21 0340 10    on the character of the site itself, the previous experience
E21 0350 10    of the investigator, and the number of factors needed
E21 0360  7    to arrive at a good decision. It is too easy for the
E21 0370  7    inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a
E21 0380  3    few values of the area and base a decision on these
E21 0380 14    alone. Usually there are more factors to good site
E21 0390  8    planning than first impressions. A site may be a rundown
E21 0400  7    slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today
E21 0410  2    but have excellent potentials for the future with a
E21 0410 11    little development or water. The same is true of areas
E21 0420 10    which at first look good because of a few existing
E21 0430  7    recreation features but may actually be poor areas
E21 0440  4    to develop for general public use.
E21 0440 10       In looking for the best sites available that meet
E21 0450  7    the requirements, you need information to compare the
E21 0460  4    site with others. You need answers to four important
E21 0470  1    questions.
E21 0470  2       @ What are the existing recreation features?
E21 0480  1       @ How well can the site be developed?
E21 0480  9       @ How useful will it be to the public?
E21 0490  7       @ Is this site available?
E21 0500  1       Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation
E21 0500 11    interests already existing at the site. Naturally,
E21 0510  7    a park site with scenic views, a good lake, trees,
E21 0520  6    and sand dunes, will attract more people than a nearby
E21 0530  4    area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally
E21 0530 13    important. Frontage on a body of clear, clean water
E21 0540  9    will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage
E21 0550  7    on polluted water. Some recreation features, such as
E21 0560  4    scenic values and water interest, also have greater
E21 0570  1    overall value than other interests.
E21 0570  6       One of the most desirable features for a park are
E21 0580  6    beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant views
E21 0590  2    of a valley or the mountains or natural features such
E21 0590 12    as a small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual
E21 0600  8    trees. A site which overlooks a harbor or river may
E21 0610  7    offer interest in the activities of boating traffic.
E21 0620  2    An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the
E21 0620 13    surf rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive
E21 0630 12    just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note
E21 0640  9    extent of these interests and how available they will
E21 0650  5    be for the public to enjoy.
E21 0650 11       Water interest is one of the most valuable factors
E21 0660  8    you can find for a recreation site. Most park planners
E21 0670  5    look to water frontage for basic park areas. This follows
E21 0680  3    naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake
E21 0690  1    provides scenic values and opportunities for the very
E21 0690  9    popular recreation activities of bathing, fishing,
E21 0700  5    boating, and other water sports. A body of water is
E21 0710  6    usually the center of interest at parks which attract
E21 0720  1    the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools
E21 0720 10    the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild
E21 0730  7    life.
E21 0730  8       The amount of water frontage, the quantity and quality
E21 0740  6    of the water, and the recreation afforded by it are
E21 0750  5    important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded
E21 0760  1    an area for public use. The quantity of water flow
E21 0760 11    may be critical; a stream or pond which is attractive
E21 0770  8    in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late
E21 0780  5    summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level of
E21 0790  2    the water at various seasons as it affects recreation
E21 0790 11    should be studied. Check the quality of the water.
E21 0800  8    A stream which has all of its watershed within a national
E21 0810  6    forest or other lands under good conservation practices
E21 0820  2    is less likely to be affected by pollution than one
E21 0830  1    passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial
E21 0830  9    area. Other factors, such as water temperature, depth
E21 0840  7    of water, the fish life it supports, wave action, flooding,
E21 0850  5    etcetera, will affect its recreation value.
E21 0860  2    ##
E21 0860  3    OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest
E21 0870  1    are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast,
E21 0870  8    beaches, sand dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera
E21 0880  5    with which the area is blessed. Just as the national
E21 0890  5    and state parks place emphasis on features which are
E21 0900  2    of national or state significance, counties should
E21 0900  9    seek out these features which are distinctive of their
E21 0910  7    area. Although the site may not contain the features
E21 0920  5    themselves, there are often opportunities to include
E21 0930  3    them as additional interest to the site. The route
E21 0930 12    to the park may lead people past them or display views
E21 0940 10    of them. A group of native trees or plants which are
E21 0950  7    outstanding in a particular county can be featured
E21 0960  3    at the site.
E21 0960  6       The fish, animals, and birds which may be found
E21 0970  4    at the site are another interest. Fishing interest
E21 0970 12    calls for a check of the species found, quantity and
E21 0980 10    size, the season they are available, and the stocking
E21 0990  6    program of the fish commission. Animals may be present
E21 1000  4    at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The
E21 1010  1    site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory
E21 1010 12    birds or have its own resident bird life. Clams, crabs,
E21 1020  7    and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas.
E21 1030  5    ##
E21 1030  6    EACH AREA has its own historical interests with which
E21 1040  4    much can be done. Park visitors are always eager to
E21 1050  3    learn more about the area they are in. The historical
E21 1050 13    sign tells its story, but nothing gets interest across
E21 1060  9    as well as some of the original historical items or
E21 1070  5    places themselves which still have the character of
E21 1080  3    the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual
E21 1080 12    rock formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's
E21 1090  8    crust in your region. Those which tell a story of the
E21 1100  8    earth's formation in each area can add geological interest
E21 1110  5    to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck, a high dam,
E21 1120  4    an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other
E21 1130  1    semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera
E21 1130 11    may be of interest. Some areas may provide archeological
E21 1140  6    values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting
E21 1150  5    areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.
E21 1160  1       How well can the site be developed? Look at the
E21 1160 10    physical features of the land to determine how desirable
E21 1170  8    it is for use, what can be done to correct the faults,
E21 1180  5    and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs
E21 1190  2    in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be
E21 1190 12    checked:
E21 1200  1    #SIZE AND SHAPE#
E21 1200  4    - The size of the area alone can be a determining factor.
E21 1210  2    An area may be too small for the needs of the project.
E21 1220  1    Areas should be large enough to include the attractions,
E21 1220 10    have ample space for the use of facilities needed,
E21 1230  8    and have room around the edges to protect the values
E21 1240  5    of the area from encroachment by private developments.
E21 1250  1    Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as
E21 1250 11    recreation areas are never too large for the future
E21 1260  9    and it is often more economical to operate one large
E21 1270  5    area than several small ones.
E21 1270 10       Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions
E21 1280 11    and needs of the development. A large picnic area or
E21 1290  7    camping development is most efficient in shape as a
E21 1300  5    square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in
E21 1310  2    preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred
E21 1310 12    feet wide. This is true because of savings in utility
E21 1320  8    lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful
E21 1330  5    radius equal in all directions. However, a narrow strip
E21 1340  3    may be very practical for small developments, or to
E21 1340 12    provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's
E21 1350  7    trail, or include scenic strips within the park unit.
E21 1360  7    #ADJOINING AREAS#
E21 1360  9    - The values of the site may be affected by the appearance
E21 1370 10    of the adjoining lands, ownership and use of the land,
E21 1380  7    and the utilities available there. For instance, a
E21 1390  3    site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as
E21 1390 11    a national forest or a public road, may be desirable,
E21 1400  9    whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not.
E21 1410  7    The utilities available nearby may provide a savings
E21 1420  4    in the cost of extending electricity or water to the
E21 1430  1    site.
E21 1430  2    #TOPOGRAPHY#
E21 1430  3    - Topography is very important. Check the elevation
E21 1440  2    of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage,
E21 1440 11    rock outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as
E21 1450  9    subsoil. Nearly level areas are required for parking
E21 1460  6    areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields, etcetera. Determine
E21 1470  3    how much topography limits useful area or what the
E21 1480  2    costs of earth moving or grading might be.
E21 1480 10    #WATER#
E21 1480 11    - In addition to its recreation interests, water is
E21 1490  7    needed for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation. The
E21 1500  4    quantity and quality of water sources is often a big
E21 1510  4    factor in site selection. The area may provide good
E21 1510 13    springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal
E21 1520 11    water lines. Figure the cost of providing water to
E21 1530  7    the use areas.
E21 1530 10    #PLANTS#
E21 1530 11    - The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking.
E21 1540  8    Look at the trees as to size and interest, the amount
E21 1550  8    of shade they provide, how healthy they are, the problems
E21 1560  5    of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, etcetera.
E21 1570  2       An area may have been partially logged and requires
E21 1580  1    removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of
E21 1580 12    good landscaping value, other areas of brush may need
E21 1590  8    to be cleared. The extent and location of open areas
E21 1600  4    is noted.
E21 1600  6    #EXPOSURE#
E21 1600  7    - How much will wind, rain, sun, and temperature affect
E21 1610  6    the use? An area sheltered from strong winds may be
E21 1620  5    highly desirable for recreation use. The direction,
E21 1630  1    velocity, and season of these winds should be noted
E21 1630 10    as to just how they will affect the recreation use
E21 1640  7    and your maintenance and operation of the area. Lack
E21 1650  5    of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the
E21 1660  2    development of shade and irrigation of a site to make
E21 1660 12    it useable. Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure
E21 1670  8    for sites where the topography or trees of the area
E21 1680  6    will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or whatever
E21 1690  2    may be most desirable for the use intended.
E21 1690 10    #IMPROVEMENTS#
E21 1700  1    - Some areas may already have been improved and contain
E21 1700 12    buildings, roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera
E21 1710  6    which may raise the cost of the site.
