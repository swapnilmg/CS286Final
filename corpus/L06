L06 0010  1       Eight, nine steps above him, Roberts had paused.
L06 0010  9    Mickey paused with him, waiting, no longer impatient,
L06 0020  7    trying now to think it out, do a little planning. He
L06 0030  6    looked down over the banister at the hotel desk, with
L06 0040  2    the telephone and pen set.
L06 0040  7       If I could call in, they could check the story while
L06 0050  6    we were on our way. I wouldn't have to tell them I
L06 0070  4    had Roberts-
L06 0070  6       Then he heard it, like a muffled thud, felt a subtle
L06 0080  5    change in air pressure. He glanced up in time to see
L06 0090  2    Roberts hurtling down on him from above, literally
L06 0090 10    flying through the air, his bloody face twisted. Mickey
L06 0100  8    tried to flatten against the banister, gripped it with
L06 0110  5    one hand, but Roberts' full weight struck him at that
L06 0120  4    moment in the groin. He gasped for air and the impact
L06 0130  1    tore his hand from the rail. He tumbled with Roberts,
L06 0140 10    helpless and in agony, over and over, down the steps.
L06 0150  8       By a wrenching effort, he managed to hunch and draw
L06 0160  7    in, to take the final fall on his back and shoulders
L06 0170  2    rather than his head. He was fuzzy in his mind and,
L06 0170 13    for a moment, helpless on the lobby floor, but he was
L06 0180 10    conscious, and free of the weight of Roberts' body.
L06 0190  6    When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling
L06 0200  3    upward, reaching. Mickey was on his knees when Roberts
L06 0210  1    turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand.
L06 0210 12    He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had
L06 0220  9    retrieved the only weapon at hand.
L06 0230  3       Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet, which would
L06 0240  2    first betray the moment and direction of an attack.
L06 0240 11    He rose stiffly, forcing his knees to lock. The knifelike
L06 0250  8    pain in his groin nearly brought him down again. He
L06 0260  6    made himself back off slowly, his eyes wary on Roberts,
L06 0270  4    who now had no more to lose than he. The pain dulled
L06 0280  1    as he moved, and he steadied inside. After a moment
L06 0280 11    he extended one hand, the fingers curled.
L06 0290  5       "Come on", he said. "You want to be that big a fool-
L06 0300  7    I was hoping for this".
L06 0300 12       Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and
L06 0310 10    started down the steps. He held the razor well out
L06 0320  6    to one side. He was invulnerable to attack, but he
L06 0330  3    could be handled, Mickey knew, if he could be brought
L06 0330 13    to make the first move.
L06 0340  4       They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared
L06 0350  1    the last step. Mickey waited with slack arms.
L06 0350  9       "Any time, Roberts", he said. "Or would it be easier
L06 0360  9    if I put my hands in my pockets"?
L06 0370  3       The taunt was lost on Roberts. He advanced slowly,
L06 0380  2    directly, giving no hint of a feint to either side.
L06 0380 12    He was just short of arm's reach when he stopped. Mickey
L06 0390 10    backed off two steps, forcing him to come on again.
L06 0400  7    There was a fixed grin on Roberts' face, made hideous
L06 0410  4    by the swollen nose and the smeared blood.
L06 0420  1       Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated, then
L06 0420  9    came along. They moved in a series of rhythmic fits
L06 0430  9    and starts, a macabre dance- two steps back, two steps
L06 0450  6    forward, two steps back. Mickey felt his shoulders
L06 0460  1    come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front
L06 0460 11    door. This was going to be it now, any second, and
L06 0470 10    what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the
L06 0480  7    razor, no matter what, even if Roberts should feint
L06 0490  2    with a kick to the groin, the deadly hand was his exclusive
L06 0490 14    concern.
L06 0500  1       The kick came, sudden and vicious but short. Mickey's
L06 0520  1    guts twisted with the effort, but he kept his eye on
L06 0520 12    the weapon. It moved in a silver arc toward his throat,
L06 0530  9    then veered downward. He hunched his left shoulder
L06 0540  4    into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own,
L06 0550  3    felt the blade slide off his sleeve. Before Roberts
L06 0550 12    could move inside to cut upward toward his face, he
L06 0560 10    slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly. Roberts
L06 0570  4    sagged and slashed at him wildly. Ducking, Mickey tripped
L06 0580  3    and fell to one side, landing heavily on the wood floor.
L06 0590  2    Then Roberts was on him, gasping for breath and for
L06 0590 12    a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade.
L06 0600  9    He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary
L06 0610  7    sting under his left ribs. He got a knee up into Roberts'
L06 0620  5    belly, used both hands and heaved him clear, then scrambled
L06 0630  3    to his feet. They were in the center of the lobby now.
L06 0640  1    Still clutching the razor, Roberts came up into a crouch,
L06 0640 11    shaking his head. When he charged Mickey was ready.
L06 0650  9    He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the
L06 0660  8    razor cut toward him feebly, then wobbled in mid-air.
L06 0670  4    With his right fist, and nearly all his weight behind
L06 0680  1    it, he smashed at the bloodstained face.
L06 0680  8       Roberts careened backward, his back arched, fought
L06 0690  5    for balance and, failing, stumbled against the newel
L06 0700  3    post at the foot of the stairs. The sound of his head
L06 0700 15    striking the solid wood was an ultimate, sudden-end
L06 0710  9    sound. He fell on his side across the lowest step,
L06 0720  7    rolled over once, then lay still.
L06 0730  1       Mickey found himself leaning against the desk, with
L06 0730  9    stiff hands, panting for breath. After a minute he
L06 0740  8    went to Roberts, looked at one of his eyes and felt
L06 0750  6    for a pulse. He couldn't feel any. Roberts appeared
L06 0760  1    to be dead; if not yet, then soon, very soon. Suddenly
L06 0760 12    it was cold in the lobby.
L06 0770  5    #@ 12#
L06 0770  7    It seemed to him that a long time had passed before
L06 0780  4    he decided what to do. Actually it was no more than
L06 0790  1    eight or ten minutes, and the sum of his reasoning
L06 0790 11    came to this:
L06 0800  1       There's no way to take him in now and keep those
L06 0800 12    other two- Wister and the one who hired the two of
L06 0810 10    them- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out.
L06 0820  5    The local law here would hold me till they check clear
L06 0830  3    back home, and maybe more than that. They would have
L06 0830 13    to. By then they could never catch up with the others.
L06 0840 11    There's no other way; I'll have to do it myself.
L06 0850  8       He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step.
L06 0860  6    Mickey was sure now he was dead.
L06 0870  1       One thing, he thought, nobody knows about it yet.
L06 0870 10    Only me.
L06 0880  1       He climbed the stairs, went into Roberts' room,
L06 0880  9    found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could.
L06 0890  9    He left a few things. It didn't have to be perfect.
L06 0900  5    Roberts was a wastrel. Walking away on impulse, he
L06 0910  2    might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient
L06 0910 10    to carry.
L06 0920  1       When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and
L06 0920 12    moved about the room, wiping carefully everything he
L06 0930  7    might have touched. It took him nearly an hour. He
L06 0940  6    went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat.
L06 0950  3    He left the rest of his things and returned to the
L06 0950 14    lobby. He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door,
L06 0960  9    went outside and walked back to the garage. He was
L06 0970  8    mildly surprised to find it was snowing. It snowed
L06 0980  3    softly, silently, an undulating interruption of his
L06 0980 10    vision against the night sky. He could feel it on his
L06 0990 11    face and in his hair.
L06 1000  2       He found the key to the Jeep, got it started and
L06 1000 13    warmed it up for five minutes. Then he backed out and
L06 1010 11    swung around to the front drive. He went into the hotel
L06 1020  7    and searched till he found the razor. He put it in
L06 1030  5    his own pocket for safekeeping. He took the suitcase
L06 1040  1    out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat. Then
L06 1040 13    he went back for Roberts.
L06 1050  2       The body was heavier than he had anticipated. He
L06 1060  1    got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried
L06 1060 11    it outside and down to the Jeep. He dumped it into
L06 1070  8    the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out, then returned
L06 1080  5    to the porch and closed the front door, making sure
L06 1090  2    it was unlocked.
L06 1090  5       He drove carefully in the direction of the brief
L06 1100  4    tour they had taken earlier. It snowed continuously,
L06 1100 12    but quietly, evenly. When he reached the dip in the
L06 1110 10    woods, he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely
L06 1120  7    discernible. The Jeep fought its way through the low
L06 1130  5    spot and got onto higher ground. He drove in low gear
L06 1140  2    to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible
L06 1140 14    to the entrance to the abandoned mine. He parked facing
L06 1150  8    it and left the headlights on, but when he started
L06 1160  6    into the tunnel with the suitcase, he found the illumination
L06 1170  3    extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the
L06 1180  1    passage. He went back and got the flashlight, returned
L06 1180 10    to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge
L06 1190  8    of the pit he had found earlier. He tossed the bag
L06 1200  5    into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it.
L06 1210  2    When the dust settled, he went back to the Jeep and
L06 1210 13    carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder.
L06 1220  7       It wasn't like carrying the suitcase. The soft snow
L06 1230  6    was deceitful underfoot. Twice he nearly fell. Inside
L06 1240  4    the passage, he had to work his way over the fallen
L06 1250  1    timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden.
L06 1250  9    By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting
L06 1260 11    and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the
L06 1270  7    dead weight.
L06 1270  9       He stood looking down for a few seconds, then backed
L06 1280  7    up two or three paces from the edge. There was too
L06 1290  4    much weight casually to toss it away. He could feel
L06 1300  1    himself falling in with it and being unable to get
L06 1300 11    out. It would be a bad place to die. It was a bad place
L06 1310 11    for Roberts to wind up, but Roberts had asked for it.
L06 1320  6    It was too late to worry about that.
L06 1330  1       He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor
L06 1330 11    of the tunnel. It was a relief to get rid of the weight.
L06 1340 11    He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple
L06 1350  7    of minutes to get his breath and settle down. Then
L06 1360  2    he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward
L06 1360 12    the edge. It hung momentarily on the point of dropping
L06 1370  9    off. He gave it a strong push, heard it slide, then
L06 1380  7    tumble dryly into the hole. He got to his feet and
L06 1390  5    threw the flashlight beam into the pit. The body lay
L06 1400  1    in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the
L06 1400 11    level of the tunnel floor.
L06 1410  2       Deep enough, he decided. There was little chance
L06 1420  1    anyone would enter this shaft during the winter. The
L06 1420 10    external signs of his approach to it would be covered
L06 1430  8    by the snow, probably by the next day. It wasn't cold
L06 1440  5    enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact. By
L06 1450  2    spring it would be a skeleton.
L06 1450  8       He made his way back to the Jeep. He had started
L06 1460  6    to back into the turn when he remembered the razor
L06 1470  3    in his pocket. He climbed down, went back into the
L06 1470 13    tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit. It landed
L06 1480  9    on Roberts' sprawled right thigh, poised precariously,
L06 1490  4    then slid off to the ground. He went back once more
L06 1500  4    to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel.
L06 1510  1       In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the
L06 1510 12    use he had made of it. There were stains here and there
L06 1520 10    and he cleaned them off, using an oiled rag he found
L06 1530  7    on a nail. He wiped the steering wheel and all the
L06 1540  4    places he might have touched the Jeep. He replaced
L06 1540 13    the flashlight where it had been stowed, got into his
L06 1550 10    own car and backed it out of the garage. There were
L06 1560  7    tire marks where it had been, but they were overlapped
L06 1570  3    by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable
L06 1580  1    except under close scrutiny. Liz Peabody, he thought,
L06 1580  9    might spend some time grieving for her lost lover,
L06 1590  8    but he doubted that she would launch an investigation.
L06 1600  4    He judged her to be a woman of some pride, though not
L06 1610  3    much sense. Still she would probably have sense enough
L06 1610 12    not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend
L06 1620 12    who, apparently, had run away.
