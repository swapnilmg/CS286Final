A03 0010  1       Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary
A03 0010  8    trial made statements indicating their guilt at the
A03 0020  7    time of their arrest, Judge James B. Parsons was told
A03 0030  6    in Criminal court yesterday.
A03 0040  1       The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense
A03 0040  7    counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude
A03 0050  8    to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing
A03 0060  3    the eight former policemen now on trial.
A03 0070  1       Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge
A03 0070  9    Parsons to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate
A03 0080  8    trial. Bellows made the request while the all-woman
A03 0090  5    jury was out of the courtroom.
A03 0090 11    #FEARS PREJUDICIAL ASPECTS#
A03 0100  2    "The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client",
A03 0110  2    Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly
A03 0120  1    indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
A03 0120  9    It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the
A03 0130 10    defendants made statements involving themselves and
A03 0140  4    others".
A03 0140  5       Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired,
A03 0150  5    "You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting
A03 0160  2    this"?
A03 0160  3       "Yes, your honor", replied Bellows. "What this amounts
A03 0170  5    to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all fight
A03 0180  2    in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants".
A03 0200  1    _WASHINGTON, JULY 24_
A03 0200  4       - President Kennedy today pushed aside other White
A03 0210  2    House business to devote all his time and attention
A03 0210 11    to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver
A03 0220  9    tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide
A03 0230  5    television and radio.
A03 0230  8       The President spent much of the week-end at his
A03 0240 10    summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of
A03 0250  6    portions of the address with the help of White House
A03 0260  3    aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
A03 0260 12       Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington
A03 0270  9    in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House
A03 0280  8    spokesman said the address text still had "quite a
A03 0290  8    way to go" toward completion.
A03 0300  1    #DECISIONS ARE MADE#
A03 0300  4    Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press
A03 0310  3    secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go thru
A03 0320  2    several more drafts".
A03 0320  5       Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers,
A03 0330  3    and members of his staff were doing on the address
A03 0340  1    involved composition and wording, rather than last
A03 0340  8    minute decisions on administration plans to meet the
A03 0350  7    latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands
A03 0360  4    and proposals for the city.
A03 0370  1       The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov.
A03 0370 11    8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge
A03 0380  7    John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained
A03 0390  6    evidence "by unfair and fundamentally illegal means".
A03 0400  3       Karns said that the cases involved a matter "of
A03 0410  3    even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"
A03 0420  1    of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in
A03 0420 11    violation of the legal rights of citizens".
A03 0430  6       Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
A03 0440  6    In the two other cases he ruled that the state had
A03 0450  2    been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings
A03 0450 10    originally had been brought against 677 persons in
A03 0460  8    133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler, special prosecutor.
A03 0470  4    #ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS#
A03 0470  7    Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued
A03 0480  9    grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in
A03 0490  7    the election investigation, questioned the individuals
A03 0500  3    in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them
A03 0510  1    before the grand jury.
A03 0510  5       Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in
A03 0520  3    the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure
A03 0530  1    constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly
A03 0530  7    that coercion was used in questioning.
A03 0540  5       Karns said it was a "wrongful act" for Wexler to
A03 0550  4    take statements "privately and outside of the grand
A03 0560  1    jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious
A03 0560 10    misuse" of the Criminal court processes.
A03 0570  6       "Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted
A03 0580  5    a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho
A03 0590  3    vindication of the authority of that court is not the
A03 0600  1    function of this court", said Karns, who is a City
A03 0600 11    judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court.
A03 0610  8    #FACED SEVEN CASES#
A03 0620  1    Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases
A03 0620 11    involving 35 persons. Wexler had charged the precinct
A03 0630  7    judges in these cases with "complementary" miscount
A03 0640  3    of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one
A03 0650  3    candidate and given to another.
A03 0650  8       The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and
A03 0660  7    42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts
A03 0670  4    of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward,
A03 0680  1    and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.
A03 0680  9       The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the
A03 0690  7    23d ward had been heard previously and taken under
A03 0700  2    advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under
A03 0700 11    advisement.
A03 0710  1    #CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING#
A03 0710  4    After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward
A03 0720  4    case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled
A03 0730  2    for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed,
A03 0730 11    he would dismiss them.
A03 0750  1    _WASHINGTON, FEB. 9_
A03 0750  4       - President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new
A03 0760  2    medical care program whereby social security taxes
A03 0760  9    on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay
A03 0770  8    the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million
A03 0780  6    Americans over 65 who are covered by social security
A03 0790  3    or railroad retirement programs.
A03 0790  7       The President, in a special message to Congress,
A03 0800  7    tied in with his aged care plan requests for large
A03 0810  4    federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,
A03 0820  1    build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and
A03 0820 11    expand child health care and general medical research.
A03 0830  7       The aged care plan, similar to one the President
A03 0840  6    sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol
A03 0850  4    hill. It was defeated in Congress last year.
A03 0850 12    #COST UP TO $37 A YEAR#
A03 0860  6    It would be financed by boosting the social security
A03 0870  1    payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the
A03 0870 14    workers now paying such taxes.
A03 0880  4       The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent-
A03 0890  3    3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first
A03 0890 14    $4,800 of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would
A03 0900 10    boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax
A03 0910  8    to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each. Similar payroll
A03 0920  3    tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad
A03 0930  1    retirement system.
A03 0930  3       The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent
A03 0940  5    starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because
A03 0950  1    the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent
A03 0950 13    on that date to pay for other social security costs.
A03 0960  8    #OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE#
A03 0960 11    Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical
A03 0970  9    plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical
A03 0980  9    benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the
A03 0990  8    first year, 1963. Both figures would go higher in later
A03 1000  4    years.
A03 1000  5       Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail
A03 1010  3    federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars
A03 1010 12    over the next 10 years. These would be paid for out
A03 1020 11    of general, not payroll, taxes.
A03 1030  2    #NURSING HOME CARE#
A03 1030  5    The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons
A03 1040  4    over 65 who are under the social security and railroad
A03 1050  1    retirement systems:
A03 1050  3    _1._
A03 1050  4       Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90
A03 1060  5    days for each illness, except that the patient would
A03 1070  1    pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
A03 1070 13    _2._
A03 1070 14       Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180
A03 1080  9    days following discharge from a hospital. A patient
A03 1090  5    could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home
A03 1100  2    care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care
A03 1100 12    for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care
A03 1110 11    credit.
A03 1110 12    _3._
A03 1120  1       Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for
A03 1120  6    all costs in excess of $20 a patient.
A03 1130  5    _4._
A03 1130  6       Community visiting nurse services at home for up
A03 1140  3    to 240 days an illness.
A03 1140  8       The President noted that Congress last year passed
A03 1150  4    a law providing grants to states to help pay medical
A03 1160  1    bills of the needy aged.
A03 1160  6    #CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST#
A03 1160  9    He said his plan is designed to "meet the needs of
A03 1170  9    those millions who have no wish to receive care at
A03 1180  5    the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless staggered
A03 1190  2    by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-
A03 1200  3    caused by an extended hospital stay".
A03 1200  9       "This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely
A03 1210  7    essential needs", he said, "and with sufficient 'deductible'
A03 1220  5    requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary
A03 1230  4    overcrowding of our hospitals.
A03 1230  8       "This is not a program of socialized medicine. It
A03 1240  9    is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute
A03 1250  6    freedom of choice guaranteed. Every person will choose
A03 1260  4    his own doctor and hospital".
A03 1260  9    #WOULDN'T PAY DOCTORS#
A03 1270  3    The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still
A03 1280  1    be paid by the patient.
A03 1280  6       Apart from the aged care plan the President's most
A03 1290  2    ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,
A03 1300  1    and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
A03 1300 11       The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47
A03 1310 10    dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed
A03 1320  8    to meet the rising need for health care. Moreover,
A03 1330  5    he said, many qualified young people are not going
A03 1340  3    into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford
A03 1340 11    the schooling costs.
A03 1350  3    #CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS#
A03 1350  6    The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions
A03 1360  4    to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a
A03 1370  4    year for one-fourth of the first year students. The
A03 1380  1    schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships,
A03 1380 11    based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.
A03 1390  9       In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 "cost
A03 1400  6    of education" grant to the schools for each $1,500
A03 1410  3    in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined
A03 1420  1    programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year
A03 1430  7    and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.
A03 1440  4       The President recommended federal "matching grants"
A03 1450  2    totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing
A03 1460  1    new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity
A03 1460 10    of existing ones.
A03 1470  2    #MORE FOR NURSING HOMES#
A03 1470  6    In the area of "community health services", the President
A03 1480  4    called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a
A03 1490  3    year federal grants for nursing home construction.
A03 1490 10    He asked for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation
A03 1500  8    for "stimulatory grants" to states to improve nursing
A03 1510  7    homes.
A03 1510  8       He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum
A03 1520  7    for experimental hospitals.
A03 1530  1       In the child health field, the President said he
A03 1530 10    will recommend later an increase in funds for programs
A03 1540  8    under the children's bureau. He also asked Congress
A03 1550  5    to approve establishment of a national child health
A03 1560  3    institute.
A03 1560  4    #ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS#
A03 1560  7    The President said he will ask Congress to increase
A03 1570  7    grants to states for vocational rehabilitation. He
A03 1580  2    did not say by how much.
A03 1580  8       For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar
A03 1590  7    a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching
A03 1600  3    grants for building research facilities. The President
A03 1610  1    said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified
A03 1610 10    amount, the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget
A03 1620  8    for direct government research in medicine.
A03 1630  3       The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable
A03 1640  1    elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,
A03 1650  1    services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".
A03 1650 10    #REACTION AS EXPECTED#
A03 1660  3    Congressional reaction to the message was along expected
A03 1670  1    lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care
A03 1670 10    under the social security system criticized the President's
A03 1680  8    plan. Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed
A03 1690  9    the message.
A03 1690 11       Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill.] and House
A03 1700  7    Republican Leader Charles Halleck [Ind.] said the message
A03 1710  7    did not persuade them to change their opposition to
A03 1720  6    compulsory medical insurance. Halleck said the voluntary
A03 1730  4    care plan enacted last year should be given a fair
A03 1740  1    trial first.
A03 1740  3       House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D., Tex.] called the
A03 1750  3    Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no
A03 1750 12    prediction on its fate in the House.
A03 1770  1    _WASHINGTON, FEB. 9_
A03 1770  4       - Acting hastily under White House pressure, the
A03 1780  2    Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's
A03 1790  1    federal housing chief.
A03 1790  4       Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was
A03 1800  4    no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and "noes"
A03 1810  2    was heard.
A03 1810  4       Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to
A03 1820  3    speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator
A03 1820 11    of the housing and home finance agency.
A03 1830  5       In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments,
A03 1840  3    including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate
A03 1850  3    action because of a Senate rule requiring at least
A03 1860  1    a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
A03 1860 12    #ENFORCE BY DEMAND#
A03 1870  1    The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse
A03 1870 11    [D., Ore.] in connection with President Eisenhower's
A03 1880  7    cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's
A03 1890  7    in 1961.
