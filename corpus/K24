K24 0010  1    His eyes were old and they never saw well, but heated
K24 0010 12    with whisky they'd glare at my noise, growing red and
K24 0020  8    raising up his rage. I decided I hated the Pedersen
K24 0030  5    kid too, dying in our kitchen while I was away where
K24 0040  2    I couldn't watch, dying just to entertain Hans and
K24 0040 11    making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall,
K24 0050 11    Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered
K24 0060  8    with snow, snoring and whistling. Oh he'd not care
K24 0070  5    about the Pedersen kid. He'd not care about getting
K24 0080  1    waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit
K24 0080 14    of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in
K24 0090 10    the bargain. That would make him mad enough if he was
K24 0100  7    sober. I didn't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen
K24 0110  4    kid was in the kitchen.
K24 0110  9       He was all shoveled up like I thought he'd be. I
K24 0120  8    pushed at his shoulder, calling his name. I think his
K24 0140  5    name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except
K24 0150  1    to roll a little when I shoved him. The covers slid
K24 0150 12    down his skinny neck so I saw his head, fuzzed like
K24 0160  9    a dandelion gone to seed, but his face was turned to
K24 0170  6    the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose on
K24 0180  2    the plaster- and I thought, Well you don't look much
K24 0180 12    like a pig-drunk bully now. I couldn't be sure he was
K24 0190 12    still asleep. He was a cagey sonofabitch. I shook him
K24 0200  8    a little harder and made some noise. "Pap-pap-pap-hey",
K24 0210  5    I said.
K24 0210  7       I was leaning too far over. I knew better. He always
K24 0220  6    slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach
K24 0230  3    him. Oh he was smart. It put you off. I knew better
K24 0230 15    but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked
K24 0240 10    in all that dough. When his arm came up I ducked away
K24 0250  9    but it caught me on the side of the neck, watering
K24 0260  4    my eyes, and I backed off to cough. Pa was on his side,
K24 0270  2    looking at me, his eyes winking, the hand that had
K24 0270 12    hit me a fist in the pillow.
K24 0280  4       "Get the hell out of here".
K24 0280 10       I didn't say anything, trying to get my throat clear,
K24 0290  9    but I watched him. He was like a mean horse to come
K24 0300  9    at from the rear. It was better, though, he'd hit me.
K24 0310  4    He was bitter when he missed.
K24 0310 10       "Get the hell out of here".
K24 0320  5       "Big Hans sent me. He told me to wake you".
K24 0330  2       "A fat hell on Big Hans. Get out of here".
K24 0340  1       "He found the Pedersen kid by the crib".
K24 0340  9       "Get the hell out".
K24 0350  3       Pa pulled at the covers. He was tasting his mouth.
K24 0360  1       "The kid's froze good. Hans is rubbing him with
K24 0360 10    snow. He's got him in the kitchen".
K24 0370  7       "Pedersen"?
K24 0380  1       "No, Pa. It's the Pedersen kid. The kid".
K24 0380  9       "Nothing to steal from the crib".
K24 0390  6       "Not stealing, Pa. He was just lying there. Hans
K24 0400  4    found him froze. That's where he was when Hans found
K24 0410  2    him".
K24 0410  3       Pa laughed.
K24 0410  5       "I ain't hid nothing in the crib".
K24 0420  3       "You don't understand, Pa. The Pedersen kid. The
K24 0430  3    kid"-
K24 0430  4       "I god damn well understand".
K24 0440  1       Pa had his head up, glaring, his teeth gnawing at
K24 0440 10    the place where he'd grown a mustache once.
K24 0450  5       "I god damn well understand. You know I don't want
K24 0460  5    to see Pedersen. That cock. Why should I? What did
K24 0470  2    he come for, hey? God dammit, get. And don't come back.
K24 0480  1    Find out something. You're a fool. Both you and Hans.
K24 0480 11    Pedersen. That cock. Don't come back. Out. Out".
K24 0490  8       He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his
K24 0500  7    fist on the pillow. He had long black hairs on his
K24 0510  5    wrist. They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt.
K24 0520  1       "Big Hans made me come. Big Hans said"-
K24 0530  1       "A fat hell on Big Hans. He's an even bigger fool
K24 0530 11    than you are. Fat, hey? I taught him, dammit, and I'll
K24 0540  9    teach you. Out. You want me to drop my pot"?
K24 0550  7       He was about to get up so I got out, slamming the
K24 0560  4    door. He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep.
K24 0570  1    Then he threw things. Once he went after Hans and dumped
K24 0570 12    his pot over the banister. Pa'd been shit-sick in that
K24 0580 10    pot. Hans got an axe. He didn't even bother to wipe
K24 0590  8    himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before
K24 0600  6    he stopped. He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't
K24 0610  5    been locked in laughing fit to shake the house. That
K24 0620  2    pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought
K24 0620 13    of it. I always felt the memory was present in both
K24 0630  9    of them, stirring in their chests like a laugh or a
K24 0640  7    growl, as eager as an animal to be out. I heard Pa
K24 0650  3    cursing all the way downstairs.
K24 0650  8       Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest
K24 0660  6    and stomach. He was rubbing snow on the kid's legs
K24 0670  4    and feet. Water from the snow and water from the towels
K24 0680  1    had run off the kid to the table where the dough was,
K24 0680 13    and the dough was turning pasty, sticking to the kid's
K24 0690  8    back and behind.
K24 0700  1       "Ain't he going to wake up"?
K24 0700  6       "What about your pa"?
K24 0710  1       "He was awake when I left".
K24 0710  7       "What'd he say? Did you get the whisky"?
K24 0720  6       "He said a fat hell on Big Hans".
K24 0730  2       "Don't be smart. Did you ask him about the whisky"?
K24 0740  1       "Yeah".
K24 0740  2       "Well"?
K24 0740  3       "He said a fat hell on Big Hans".
K24 0750  7       "Don't be smart. What's he going to do"?
K24 0760  5       "Go back to sleep most likely".
K24 0770  1       "You'd best get that whisky".
K24 0770  6       "You go. Take the axe. Pa's scared to hell of axes".
K24 0780  7       "Listen to me, Jorge, I've had enough to your sassing.
K24 0790  7    This kid's froze bad. If I don't get some whisky down
K24 0800  5    him he might die. You want the kid to die? Do you?
K24 0810  3    Well, get your pa and get that whisky".
K24 0810 11       "Pa don't care about the kid".
K24 0820  6       "Jorge".
K24 0820  7       "Well he don't. He don't care at all, and I don't
K24 0830 11    care to get my head busted neither. He don't care,
K24 0840  6    and I don't care to have his shit flung on me. He don't
K24 0850  6    care about anybody. All he cares about is his whisky
K24 0860  3    and that dry crack in his face. Get pig-drunk- that's
K24 0870  1    what he wants. He don't care about nothing else at
K24 0870 11    all. Nothing. Not Pedersen's kid neither. That cock.
K24 0880  7    Not the kid neither".
K24 0890  1       "I'll get the spirits", Ma said.
K24 0890  7       I'd wound Big Hans up tight. I was ready to jump
K24 0900  9    but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised
K24 0910  4    him like it surprised me, and he ran down. Ma never
K24 0920  2    went near the old man when he was sleeping it off.
K24 0920 13    Not any more. Not for years. The first thing every
K24 0930  8    morning when she washed her face she could see the
K24 0940  5    scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot cleat,
K24 0950  2    and maybe she saw him heaving it again, the dirty sock
K24 0950 13    popping out as it flew. It should have been nearly
K24 0960 10    as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big
K24 0970  7    Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still
K24 0980  4    spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides.
K24 0980 10       "No you won't", Big Hans said.
K24 0990  6       "Yes, Hans, if they're needed", Ma said.
K24 1000  3       Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop
K24 1010  3    her. If we had, then one of us would have had to go
K24 1010 16    instead. Hans rubbed the kid with more snow ... rubbed
K24 1020 10    ... rubbed.
K24 1030  1       "I'll get more snow", I said. I took the pail and
K24 1030 11    shovel and went out on the porch. I don't know where
K24 1040  9    Ma went. I thought she'd gone upstairs and expected
K24 1050  5    to hear she had. She had surprised Hans like she had
K24 1060  4    surprised me when she said she'd go, and then she surprised
K24 1070  1    him again when she came back so quick like she must
K24 1070 12    have, because when I came in with the snow she was
K24 1080  8    there with a bottle with three white feathers on its
K24 1090  5    label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat.
K24 1100  1       Oh, he was being queer and careful, pawing about
K24 1100 10    in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at
K24 1110 10    the length of his arm. He was awful angry because he'd
K24 1120  7    thought Ma was going to do something big, something
K24 1130  3    heroic even, especially for her ... I know him ...
K24 1140  1    I know him ... we felt the same sometimes ... while
K24 1140 12    Ma wasn't thinking about that at all, not anything
K24 1150  6    like that. There was no way of getting even. It wasn't
K24 1160  4    like getting cheated at the fair. They were always
K24 1170  1    trying so you got to expect it. Now Hans had given
K24 1170 12    Ma something of his- we both had when we thought she
K24 1180  8    was going straight to Pa- something valuable; but since
K24 1190  5    she didn't know we'd given it to her, there was no
K24 1200  4    easy way of getting it back.
K24 1200 10       Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the
K24 1210  6    cap. He was put out too because there was only one
K24 1220  4    way of understanding what she'd done. Ma had found
K24 1220 13    one of Pa's hiding places. She'd found one and she
K24 1230 10    hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted
K24 1240  9    and hunted as we always did all winter, every winter
K24 1250  4    since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked
K24 1260  2    in the privy and found the first one. Pa had a knack
K24 1260 14    for hiding. He knew we were looking and he enjoyed
K24 1270  9    it. But now Ma. She'd found it by luck most likely
K24 1280  7    but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how
K24 1290  3    long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found,
K24 1300  1    saying nothing. Pa was sure to find out. Sometimes
K24 1300 10    he didn't seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't
K24 1310 11    find them himself or because he looked and didn't find
K24 1320  7    anything and figured he hadn't hid one after all or
K24 1330  6    had drunk it up. But he'd find out about this one because
K24 1340  3    we were using it. A fool could see what was going on.
K24 1340 15    If he found out Ma found it- that'd be bad. He took
K24 1350 12    pride in his hiding. It was all the pride he had. I
K24 1360 10    guess fooling Hans and me took doing. But he didn't
K24 1370  5    figure Ma for much. He didn't figure her at all, and
K24 1371  4    if he found out ... a woman ... it'd be bad.
K24 1380  8       Hans poured some in a tumbler.
K24 1390  6       "You going to put more towels on him"?
K24 1400  1       "No".
K24 1400  2       "Why not? That's what he needs, something warm to
K24 1410  4    his skin, don't he"?
K24 1410  8       "Not where he's froze good. Heat's bad for frostbite.
K24 1420  8    That's why I only put towels on his chest and belly.
K24 1430  8    He's got to thaw slow. You ought to know that".
K24 1440  4       Colors on the towels had run.
K24 1440 10       Ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes.
K24 1450  7       "What are we going to do with these"?
K24 1460  3       Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth
K24 1470  2    but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat
K24 1470 12    and in a second it was dripping from his chin.
K24 1480  9       "Here, help me prop him up. I got hold his mouth
K24 1490  8    open".
K24 1490  9       I didn't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would
K24 1500  7    do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled
K24 1510  3    on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't
K24 1520  1    make any move to.
K24 1520  5       "Come on, Jorge".
K24 1520  8       "All right".
K24 1530  1       "Lift, don't shove ... lift".
K24 1530  6       "O.K., I'm lifting".
K24 1540  3       I took him by the shoulders. His head flopped back.
K24 1550  2    His mouth fell open. The skin on his neck was tight.
K24 1550 13    He was cold all right.
K24 1560  5       "Hold his head up. He'll choke".
K24 1570  1       "His mouth is open".
K24 1570  5       "His throat's shut. He'll choke".
K24 1580  2       "He'll choke anyway".
K24 1580  5       "Hold his head up".
K24 1590  3       "I can't".
K24 1590  5       "Don't hold him like that. Put your arms around
K24 1600  6    him".
K24 1600  7       "Well Jesus".
K24 1610  1       He was cold all right. I put my arm carefully around
K24 1610 12    him. Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth.
K24 1620  7       "Now he'll choke for sure".
K24 1630  1       "Shut up. Just hold him like I told you".
K24 1640  1       He was cold all right, and wet. I had my arm behind
K24 1640 12    his back.
