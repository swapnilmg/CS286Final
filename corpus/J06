J06 0010  1    ##
J06 0010  2    The thermal exchange of chlorine between **f and liquid
J06 0010 11    **f is readily measurable at temperatures in the range
J06 0020  8    of 180` and above. The photochemical exchange occurs
J06 0030  4    with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid
J06 0040  5    phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the **f.
J06 0050  1    In the gas phase, with **f of **f and **f of **f, quantum
J06 0050 14    yields of the order of **f have been observed at 85`.
J06 0060  9    Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents,
J06 0070  6    serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible
J06 0080  3    rates of reaction. It appears possible to set a lower
J06 0090  3    limit of about **f for the activation energy of the
J06 0090 13    abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride
J06 0100  9    molecule by a chlorine atom to form **f radical. The
J06 0110  7    rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to
J06 0120  3    be proportional to the first power of the absorbed
J06 0120 12    light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates
J06 0130  7    are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity
J06 0140  9    rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions.
J06 0150  4    #INTRODUCTION#
J06 0150  5    Because of the simplicity of the molecules, isotopic
J06 0160  5    exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the
J06 0170  4    corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer
J06 0180  1    particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous
J06 0180  7    basic kinetic data. It would appear that it should
J06 0190  9    be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the
J06 0200  5    thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid
J06 0210  3    and gas phases and to determine values for activation
J06 0210 12    energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms
J06 0220  9    and free radicals, as well as information on the heat
J06 0230  8    of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond. The reaction
J06 0240  4    of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly
J06 0250  2    suited for such studies. It should be possible to prepare
J06 0260  1    very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides
J06 0260  9    on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation
J06 0270  6    of the liquid. It should be possible to free carbon
J06 0280  5    tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the
J06 0290  2    usual purification methods followed by prechlorination
J06 0290  8    prior to addition of radioactive chlorine. Furthermore,
J06 0300  6    the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive
J06 0310  6    to trace amounts of impurities because it would not
J06 0320  3    be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation
J06 0320 13    energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom
J06 0330  8    would be expected to be too high; also it would be
J06 0340  7    expected that **f would compete very effectively with
J06 0350  2    any impurities as a scavenger for **f radicals. Contrary
J06 0360  1    to these expectations we have found it impossible to
J06 0360 10    obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish,
J06 0370  6    even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure
J06 0380  3    reagents. We are reporting these investigations here
J06 0390  2    briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the
J06 0390 11    study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine
J06 0400  6    and because the results furnish some information on
J06 0410  5    the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms
J06 0420  3    from carbon tetrachloride.
J06 0420  6    #EXPERIMENTAL#
J06 0430  1    _REAGENTS._
J06 0430  3       - Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed
J06 0430 10    through a tube of resublimed **f into an evacuated
J06 0440  8    Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air.
J06 0450  4    It was then distilled at least three times from a trap
J06 0460  4    at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle
J06 0460 17    fraction being retained in each distillation. The purified
J06 0470  8    product was stored at -78` in a tube equipped with
J06 0480 10    a break seal.
J06 0480 13       Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine
J06 0490  6    with radiochlorine, the exchange of inactive chlorine
J06 0500  4    with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was
J06 0510  2    found to be the most satisfactory. To prepare the latter,
J06 0520  1    silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing
J06 0520  9    **f obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
J06 0530  7    The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence
J06 0540  7    of aluminum chips with the resultant product of **f
J06 0550  4    which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line.
J06 0560  1    Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted
J06 0560  7    and the exchange was allowed to take place. The radiochlorine
J06 0570  8    was stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break
J06 0580  8    seal.
J06 0580  9       Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt, low sulfur, reagent
J06 0590  4    grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with **f
J06 0600  3    and **f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000
J06 0600 14    watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches. The
J06 0610 11    mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water
J06 0620  6    following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled
J06 0630  3    on a Vigreux column, a 25% center cut being retained
J06 0640  1    which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence
J06 0640 10    of **f. Purified inactive chlorine was then added from
J06 0650  7    one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen
J06 0660  6    out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break
J06 0670  3    seal. This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was
J06 0670 10    illuminated for a day following which the flask was
J06 0680  9    resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine
J06 0690  6    distilled off. The required amount of carbon tetrachloride
J06 0700  3    was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a
J06 0710  2    manifold on a vacuum line. The desired amounts of inactive
J06 0710 12    chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed
J06 0720  7    in these cells on the vacuum line following which they
J06 0730  7    were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed
J06 0740  6    off. The contents of the manifold for liquid phase
J06 0750  1    experiments were then mixed by shaking, redistributed
J06 0750  8    to the reaction tubes, frozen down, and each tube was
J06 0760  8    then sealed off. The reactants for the gas phase experiments
J06 0770  6    were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the
J06 0780  4    manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the
J06 0780 13    manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing
J06 0790  8    off. This method in general solved the problem of obtaining
J06 0800  8    fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of
J06 0810  6    the six cells from a set.
J06 0820  1    _REACTION CONDITIONS AND ANALYSIS._
J06 0820  3       - The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction
J06 0830  1    studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5
J06 0830  9    mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long. In a few experiments
J06 0840  9    the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex
J06 0850  6    tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness. Both types of tube
J06 0860  4    withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres
J06 0870  1    exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`. The photochemical
J06 0870 10    reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing,
J06 0880  9    5.5 cm. long, diffraction effects being minimized by
J06 0890  7    the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass
J06 0900  5    interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces. These cells
J06 0910  3    were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of
J06 0920  2    the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing
J06 0920 11    frozen carbon tetrachloride. The round cells were reproducibly
J06 0930  7    positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated
J06 0940  7    mineral oil-bath through a window. Two types of light
J06 0950  5    source were used, a thousand watt projection lamp and
J06 0960  3    an AH6 high pressure mercury arc. The light was filtered
J06 0970  1    by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring
J06 0970 11    that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by
J06 0980 10    the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell.
J06 0990  6    Relative incident light intensities were measured with
J06 1000  4    a thermopile potentiometer system. Changes of intensity
J06 1010  1    on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and
J06 1010 13    by varying the distance of the light source from the
J06 1020  9    cell.
J06 1020 10       Following reaction the cells were scratched with
J06 1030  6    a file and opened under a 20% aqueous sodium iodide
J06 1040  3    solution. Carrier **f was added and the aqueous and
J06 1050  1    organic phases were separated (cells containing gaseous
J06 1050  8    reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening
J06 1060  7    under sodium iodide). After titration of the liberated
J06 1070  5    **f with **f, aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic
J06 1080  1    phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube.
J06 1080 10    In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride
J06 1090  8    in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the
J06 1100  5    tube before opening and weighing the fragments after
J06 1110  2    emptying. The fraction of exchange was determined as
J06 1110 10    the ratio of the counts/minute observed in the carbon
J06 1120  9    tetrachloride to the counts/minute calculated for the
J06 1130  5    carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution
J06 1140  3    of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride,
J06 1150  2    empirically determined correction being made for the
J06 1160  1    difference in counting efficiency of **f in **f and
J06 1160 10    **f.
J06 1160 11    #RESULTS#
J06 1160 12    _THE THERMAL REACTION._
J06 1170  3       - In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction,
J06 1180  2    some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were
J06 1180 11    prepared and analyzed. Experiments were done at 180,
J06 1190  8    200, 210, 220`. Following observation of the fact that
J06 1200  6    the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction
J06 1210  3    mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and
J06 1220  1    exposed under identical conditions often differed by
J06 1220  8    several hundred per cent., a systematic series of experiments
J06 1230  7    was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could
J06 1240  4    be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine,
J06 1250  1    to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect
J06 1250 12    of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes. In
J06 1260  9    addition to the method described in the section above,
J06 1270  6    chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis
J06 1280  4    of a **f eutectic on the vacuum line, and by exchange
J06 1290  1    of **f with molten **f. Calcium hydride was substituted
J06 1290 10    for **f as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride.
J06 1300  8    No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility
J06 1310  6    of the results was found.
J06 1320  1       The reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from
J06 1320  9    **f of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged
J06 1330  7    per hour. In most cases the chlorine concentration
J06 1340  2    was about **f. Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2
J06 1340 11    of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added
J06 1350 11    moisture in another, both gave reaction rates in the
J06 1360  7    range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour.
J06 1370  4    No detectable reaction was found at room temperature
J06 1380  1    for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours.
J06 1390  1    _THE LIQUID PHASE PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTION._
J06 1390  6       - The liquid phase photochemical exchange between
J06 1400  3    chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible
J06 1410  1    than the thermal exchange, although still erratic.
J06 1410  8    The improvement was most noticeable in the greater
J06 1420  7    consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group
J06 1430  5    on the same manifold. Rather large differences were
J06 1440  1    still found between reaction cells from different manifold
J06 1440  9    fillings. Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings
J06 1450  9    were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to
J06 1460  7    85` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of
J06 1470  4    the irreproducibility and to obtain information on
J06 1480  1    the activation energy and the effect of light intensity.
J06 1480 10    In all cases there was readily measurable exchange
J06 1490  6    after as little as one hour of illumination. By comparing
J06 1500  4    reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature
J06 1510  2    dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging
J06 1520  1    from 11 to 18 **f was observed while dependence on
J06 1520 11    the first power of the light intensity seemed to be
J06 1530  7    indicated in most cases.
J06 1530 11       It was possible to make estimates of the quantum
J06 1540  9    yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl
J06 1550  6    oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known
J06 1560  4    time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate
J06 1560 13    conversions based on the differences in the absorption
J06 1570  8    spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine, and considering
J06 1580  7    the spectral distribution of the light source. These
J06 1590  5    estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the
J06 1600  3    exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride
J06 1600 10    at 65` is of the order of magnitude of unity.
J06 1610  9       When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere
J06 1620  8    of oxygen had been added were illuminated, chlorine
J06 1630  2    and phosgene were produced. Exchange was also observed
J06 1640  1    in these cells, which had chlorine present at **f.
J06 1650  1    _THE PHOTOCHEMICAL EXCHANGE IN THE GAS PHASE._
J06 1650  6       - Although there was some variation in results which
J06 1660  4    must be attributed either to trace impurities or to
J06 1670  2    variation in wall effects, the photochemical exchange
J06 1670  9    in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that
J06 1680  6    it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates
J06 1690  4    in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose
J06 1700  1    of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine
J06 1700  9    concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration
J06 1710  6    on the reaction rate. Data on such comparisons together
J06 1720  5    with data on the effect of light intensity are given
J06 1730  3    in Table /1.,
J06 1730  6       In series I the relative light intensity was varied
J06 1740  4    by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction
J06 1750  2    cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. The last
J06 1750 13    column shows the rate of exchange that would have been
J06 1760 10    oserved at a relative intensity of 4 (14.7 cm. distance)
J06 1770  7    calculated on the assumptions that the incident light
J06 1780  4    intensity is inversely proportional to the square of
J06 1790  2    the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the
J06 1790 13    rate is directly proportional to the incident light
J06 1800  6    intensity. Direct proportionality of the rate to the
J06 1810  6    incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining
J06 1820  1    the value in the last column for the fourth sample
J06 1820 11    of series II where the light intensity was reduced
J06 1830  7    by use of a screen.
