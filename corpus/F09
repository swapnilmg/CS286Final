F09 0010  2    SHE GAVE HERSELF a title ... Lady Diana Harrington.
F09 0010 11       The New York D.A. gave her another ... the Golden
F09 0020 11    Girl of cafe society.
F09 0030  4       Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant,
F09 0040  1    title ... prostitute.
F09 0040  4       And Houston police have the final say in the matter
F09 0050  5    since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane
F09 0060  1    Harris Graham, 30, D.O.A. circumstances- unusual".
F09 0070  1       Early in her life she had discovered that where
F09 0070 10    there were men, there was money, and with the two came
F09 0080  9    luxury and liquor. She was still in the play for pay
F09 0090  6    business when she died, a top trollop who had given
F09 0100  2    the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes
F09 0100 11    of glamour.
F09 0110  1       She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her
F09 0110 12    neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building
F09 0120  7    told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked
F09 0130  7    at times about her past as "the Golden Girl of the
F09 0150  4    Mickey Jelke trial".
F09 0150  7       It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey)
F09 0160  5    Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that
F09 0170  5    put the spotlight on the international play-girl. (Jelke
F09 0180  2    later served 21 months when he was found guilty of
F09 0180 12    masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls.)
F09 0190  8       Diane was needed as a material witness in the case
F09 0200  5    and New York police searched three continents before
F09 0210  2    they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel,
F09 0220  1    of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady
F09 0220 12    Diana Harrington, a name that made some of the gossip
F09 0230  9    columns.
F09 0230 10       It was when she was seized as a material witness
F09 0240  8    that she got the designation she liked best.
F09 0250  4       Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant
F09 0260  1    District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the
F09 0260  9    arraigning judge:
F09 0270  2       "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.
F09 0280  1       "In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County.
F09 0280 11    In the spring and early summer of that year she met
F09 0290 11    a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France, where
F09 0300  8    she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe
F09 0310  5    with him.
F09 0310  7       "At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of
F09 0320  6    Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for King Farouk,
F09 0330  3    now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution
F09 0340  1    and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get
F09 0340 11    it.
F09 0350  1       "We have checked her in different parts of Europe
F09 0350  9    and Egypt and finally back into this country ... She
F09 0360  7    has been acting as a prostitute.
F09 0370  1       "Our information is that she gave the proceeds of
F09 0370 10    her acts to Jelke".
F09 0380  3       Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.
F09 0390  1       "That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am
F09 0390 12    not a prostitute, and I had only one very wealthy boy
F09 0400  9    friend", she said.
F09 0410  1       During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up
F09 0410  9    part of that statement.
F09 0420  1       "Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't
F09 0430  1    get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled
F09 0430 11    up all your money in the middle of the floor".
F09 0440 10       But she seemed to have underestimated the number
F09 0450  5    of her "boy friends".
F09 0450  9       She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager,
F09 0460 10    but with a "sponsor" instead of a chaperone. As she
F09 0470  7    told it, "He's a rich boy friend, an old guy about
F09 0480  5    60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed, but not
F09 0490  3    naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending
F09 0490 12    her to New York to take a screen test.
F09 0510  1       The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She
F09 0510 11    quickly moved into cafe society, possibly easing her
F09 0520  8    conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be
F09 0530  7    in show business.
F09 0530 10       She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some
F09 0540 10    of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical
F09 0550  6    joke.
F09 0550  7       An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as
F09 0560  7    "Mr. Warfield, the famous producer". The phony producer
F09 0570  3    asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.
F09 0580  1       "I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.
F09 0580  9       The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's
F09 0590 10    apartment. She thought she had great possibilities
F09 0600  6    in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer
F09 0610  4    how well she could dance.
F09 0610  9       After a few minutes he said, "I can't use you if
F09 0620  8    you dance like that. I'd like to see you dance nude".
F09 0630  6       She hastily complied. Diane loved to dance in the
F09 0640  5    nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.
F09 0650  1       She developed another quaint habit. Even among the
F09 0650  9    fast set in which she was moving, her method for keeping
F09 0660 10    an escort from departing too early was unique.
F09 0670  5       When the date would try to bid her good-night at
F09 0680  4    the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now,
F09 0680 15    I'll scream". More often than not he would bow to the
F09 0690 11    inevitable.
F09 0700  1       One who needed no such threats was a French financier.
F09 0700 11    One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was
F09 0710  8    for travel. She wanted to go around the world, but
F09 0720  7    she settled for a French holiday.
F09 0730  1       In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper
F09 0730  9    the financier told of spending several months with
F09 0740  6    her. "Then she went to Deauville where she met a member
F09 0750  6    of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".
F09 0760  1       The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur X"
F09 0760  9    recounted, and to clinch what he thought was an affair
F09 0770 10    in the making he gave her 100,000 francs (about $300)
F09 0780  7    and led her to the roulette tables.
F09 0790  1       She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And
F09 0790 12    in short order the croupier had pushed several million
F09 0800  8    francs her way. Smarter than most gamblers, she slipped
F09 0810  6    away from the casino, packed her bag and took the night
F09 0820  5    train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened to
F09 0830  2    the Greek.
F09 0830  4       The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, the
F09 0840  2    George V, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so
F09 0840 10    she high-tailed it to Rome.
F09 0850  4       She teamed up with another beauty, whose name has
F09 0860  3    been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling
F09 0860 12    that would have made Nero envious.
F09 0870  6       To climax her Roman revels, she was thrown out of
F09 0880  5    the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked
F09 0890  1    through its marble halls screaming for help.
F09 0890  8       It was a rugged finish for what must have been a
F09 0900  8    very interesting night.
F09 0900 11       Discreet Italian police described it in a manner
F09 0910  8    typically continental.
F09 0920  1       "There had been a threesome at the party in the
F09 0920 11    suite's bedroom: Miss Harrington (this was Diane's
F09 0930  6    choice for a Roman name), another woman who has figured
F09 0940  6    in other very interesting events and one of your well-known
F09 0950  6    American actors.
F09 0950  8       "The actor had had much to drink and apparently
F09 0960  6    became very violent. The hotel staff, as well as residents
F09 0970  5    of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies
F09 0980  1    were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing
F09 0980 10    down the hall.
F09 0990  1       "They were wearing nothing but their scratches.
F09 0990  8    They were asked to leave the hotel. No charges were
F09 1000  9    filed".
F09 1000 10       The girls, after dressing, were indignant.
F09 1010  5       "You can't do this to us", Diane screamed. "We are
F09 1020  6    Americans".
F09 1020  7       In the morning she found rooms directly across from
F09 1030  7    the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador.
F09 1040  4       With the Ambassador as headquarters, she continued
F09 1050  3    to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence
F09 1060  1    was limited to those who could afford it, but then
F09 1060 11    there is a limit to what one person can do.
F09 1070  8       By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and
F09 1080  5    still seeking her place in the world. She thought royal
F09 1090  2    status might come her way when, while she was still
F09 1090 12    in Rome, she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to
F09 1100  9    King Farouk of Egypt.
F09 1110  1       A close friend of hers in the Roman days described
F09 1110 11    it this way:
F09 1120  2       "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke
F09 1120 10    no English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had
F09 1130 10    a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk
F09 1140  8    she wished to meet.
F09 1150  1       "Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors
F09 1150  8    on him", the friend continued. It seemed as though
F09 1160  6    she were always auditioning.
F09 1170  1       No believer in the traditional devotion of royal
F09 1170  8    servitors, the plump Pulley broke the language barrier
F09 1180  6    and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months,
F09 1190  5    vainly hoping to see Farouk.
F09 1190 10       Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but
F09 1200 10    she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and
F09 1210  6    moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp
F09 1220  3    had no key.
F09 1220  6       She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the
F09 1230  3    flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik
F09 1240  1    Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy
F09 1240  8    members of Cairo society enjoyed her company.
F09 1250  6       "So extensive became her circle of admirers", Egyptian
F09 1260  5    police said, "that her escapades caused distrust".
F09 1270  3       The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little
F09 1280  2    world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution
F09 1290  1    to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police
F09 1290 10    picked up his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also
F09 1300  8    called upon Diane with a request for a look at her
F09 1310  8    passport.
F09 1310  9       The cagey Pulley Bey, who spoke no English, had
F09 1320  6    taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the
F09 1330  3    country without his approval. Officials provided a
F09 1330 10    temporary passport, good only for return to the United
F09 1340  9    States.
F09 1340 10       And return to the United States she did, into waiting
F09 1350 10    arms- the unromantic ones of the New York District
F09 1360  7    Attorney's office.
F09 1360  9       Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution
F09 1370  9    trial of Mickey Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable
F09 1380  7    to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House
F09 1390  5    of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.
F09 1400  1       It is a tribute to her talents that she was able
F09 1400 12    to talk the District Attorney into having her removed
F09 1410  8    from the prison to a hotel room, with her meals taken
F09 1420  7    at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian restaurant.
F09 1430  2       Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated
F09 1440  1    that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.
F09 1440 10       With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from
F09 1450  9    New York ... it was no longer fashionable to be seen
F09 1460  7    with fabulous "Lady Harrington".
F09 1470  1       Several years ago she married a Houston business
F09 1470  9    man, Robert Graham. She later divorced Graham, who
F09 1480  7    is believed to have moved to Bolivia.
F09 1490  3       Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when
F09 1500  2    the vice squad picked her up for questioning about
F09 1500 11    a call girl ring. Last May, they said, she admitted
F09 1510  7    being a prostitute.
F09 1510 10       The next time the police saw her she was dead.
F09 1520 10       It was September 20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated
F09 1530  7    apartment littered with liquor bottles. She had had
F09 1540  4    a party with a regular visitor, Dr. William W. McClellan.
F09 1550  2       McClellan, who had once lost his medical license
F09 1560  1    temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with
F09 1560 10    her when she died. He had been in the apartment two
F09 1570  8    days and was hazy about what had happened during that
F09 1580  4    time. When he realized she was dead, he called two
F09 1590  2    lawyers and then the police.
F09 1590  7       When the police arrived, they found McClellan and
F09 1600  4    the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.
F09 1610  1       The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet
F09 1610 11    and a pink blanket covered her. Pictures of her in
F09 1620  8    more glamorous days were on the walls.
F09 1630  2       An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine
F09 1630 10    in Diane's body. Police theorize that a combination
F09 1640  7    of dope, drink and drugs killed her.
F09 1650  4       "I think that maybe she wanted it this way", a vice
F09 1660  3    squad cop said. "A maid told us that she still bragged
F09 1670  1    about getting $50 a date. She was on the junk, and
F09 1670 12    they slide fast when that happens. At least she never
F09 1680  7    knew what the bottom was like". I AM a carpet salesman.
F09 1700  6       I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet
F09 1710  4    houses in the East. We cater mostly to nice people
F09 1720  1    in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a
F09 1720 12    string of snazzy, neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban
F09 1730  6    stores.
F09 1730  7       I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the
F09 1740  9    Great American Dreams- wall-to-wall carpeting.
F09 1750  2       There is only one trouble with this big, beautiful
F09 1760  2    dream. From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.
F09 1760 13       People come to me with confidence. They depend on
F09 1770 10    my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which
F09 1780  8    they themselves know little.
F09 1790  1       But I knowingly abuse their confidence.
