B18 0020  1    _SOVIETS SAID TO FEAR RESURGENCE OF GERMAN MILITARISM_
B18 0020  3       @
B18 0020  4    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0030  1       For the first time in history the entire world is
B18 0030 11    dominated by two large, powerful nations armed with
B18 0040  5    murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare
B18 0050  2    of the past a nullity. The United States and Soviet
B18 0060  1    Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations.
B18 0060 10    Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding
B18 0070  6    the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and
B18 0080  7    the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still
B18 0090  3    the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead
B18 0100  1    of negotiations.
B18 0100  3       President Kennedy was right when he said, "We shall
B18 0110  2    never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear
B18 0110 12    to negotiate". I have just returned from a seven-week
B18 0120  9    trip to Europe and the Far East. It is quite evident
B18 0130  8    that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly
B18 0140  3    opposed to participation in a nuclear war. The fact
B18 0150  2    is that the Italians, French and British know that
B18 0150 11    they have no defense against nuclear bombs. We have
B18 0160  8    no right to criticize them, as they realize they would
B18 0170  6    be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.
B18 0180  1       We should stand firmly and courageously for our
B18 0180  9    right to free access into Berlin. It would be criminal
B18 0190  7    folly if the Communists tried to prevent us. But there
B18 0200  5    is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting
B18 0210  2    de facto recognition to East Germany. Soviet Russia
B18 0210 10    has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation.
B18 0220 10    In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed
B18 0230  8    and its lands and factories were devastated.
B18 0240  3    _PROBABLE AGREEMENT_
B18 0240  5       The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence
B18 0250  5    of German militarism. Berlin is merely being used by
B18 0260  4    Moscow as a stalking horse. Actually, the Communists,
B18 0270  1    out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably
B18 0270 12    be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would
B18 0280  9    be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed
B18 0290  6    by the U. N.
B18 0290 10       If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united,
B18 0300  9    neutral and disarmed Germany, it might well be advantageous
B18 0310  7    for the German people in this nuclear age. It could
B18 0320  5    provide security without cost of armaments and increase
B18 0330  2    German prosperity and lessen taxation. France and other
B18 0330 10    Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany.
B18 0340  8    If the German people favor such a settlement we should
B18 0350  8    not oppose Germany following the example of Austria.
B18 0360  5       President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament
B18 0370  5    that might be called "Operation Survival" which has
B18 0380  3    many facets. Why not make a beginning with a united
B18 0380 13    and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity
B18 0390  7    from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big
B18 0400  7    Four powers and the United States? A united Germany,
B18 0410  4    freed of militarism, might be the first step toward
B18 0420  1    disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured
B18 0420  9    world. @
B18 0430  1    #MEETING U. N. OBLIGATIONS#
B18 0440  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0440  2       In your editorial of Sept. 30 "The Smoldering Congo"
B18 0450  1    you make the following comment: "Far too many states
B18 0450 10    are following the Russian example in refusing to pay
B18 0460  8    their assessments. It is up to the Assembly to take
B18 0470  8    action against them. They are violating their Charter
B18 0480  3    obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension
B18 0490  1    of membership or expulsion".
B18 0490  5       I would like to quote from the Charter of the United
B18 0500  6    Nations:
B18 0500  7       "Article 17, Section 1: The General Assembly shall
B18 0510  6    consider and approve the budget of the Organization.
B18 0520  4       "Section 2: The expenses of the Organization shall
B18 0530  3    be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General
B18 0540  1    Assembly.
B18 0540  2       "Article 19: A Member of the United Nations which
B18 0550  2    is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions
B18 0560  1    to the Organization shall have no vote in the General
B18 0560 11    Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds
B18 0570  9    the amount of the contributions due from it for the
B18 0580  6    preceding two full years".
B18 0580 10       The U. S. S. R. and her followers are careful in
B18 0590 10    paying their obligations to the regular budget. But
B18 0600  6    they refuse, as do the Arab states, to support the
B18 0610  4    United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United
B18 0620  1    Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer
B18 0620 11    between Egypt and Israel, and the U. N. troops in the
B18 0630 11    Congo, which expenses are not covered by the regular
B18 0640  8    budget of the United Nations, but by a special budget.
B18 0650  6       According to the official interpretation of the
B18 0660  3    Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having
B18 0660 12    the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment
B18 0670 10    of financial obligations to the "special" United Nations'
B18 0680  7    budgets, and of course cannot be expelled from the
B18 0690  7    Organization (which you suggested in your editorial),
B18 0700  4    due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter
B18 0710  2    for expulsion. @

B18 0720  1    _CONNALLY AMENDMENT'S REPEAL HELD STEP TOWARD WORLD
B18 0720  7    ORDER_
B18 0720  8       @
B18 0730  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0730  7       In your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work
B18 0740  4    of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress
B18 0750  1    you referred to the lack of "consciousness of destiny
B18 0750 10    in a time of acute national and world peril". Yet your
B18 0760  9    list of things left undone did not include repeal of
B18 0770  7    the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction
B18 0780  3    reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the
B18 0790  3    International Court of Justice.
B18 0790  7       The Connally amendment says that the United States,
B18 0800  7    rather than the court, shall determine whether a matter
B18 0810  5    is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of
B18 0820  2    the United States in a case before the World Court
B18 0820 12    to which the United States is a party. If the case
B18 0830 10    is thus determined by us to be domestic, the court
B18 0840  6    has no jurisdiction.
B18 0840  9       Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving
B18 0850  7    the same right to the other party to a dispute with
B18 0860  6    the United States, it also prevents us from using the
B18 0870  3    court effectively. Yet although the Kennedy Administration,
B18 0880  1    and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both
B18 0880  9    declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally
B18 0890  7    amendment, as contrary to our best interests, no action
B18 0900  6    has yet been taken.
B18 0900 10       Our "destiny" in these perilous times should be
B18 0910  7    to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace, with justice,
B18 0920  5    under law. To achieve this destiny, acts as well as
B18 0930  4    words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical
B18 0930 14    strength but also acts that lead to strength based
B18 0940  9    on right doing and respect.
B18 0950  1       What better affirmative step could be taken to this
B18 0950 10    end than repeal of the Connally amendment- an act which
B18 0960 10    could expose the United States to no practical risk
B18 0980  7    yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward
B18 0990  3    the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance in
B18 1000  2    a tangible way the cause of international law and order?
B18 1010  1       We believe that the list of vital things left undone
B18 1010 11    to date by the Eighty-seventh Congress should have
B18 1020  6    included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment.

B18 1030  6    #FOR BETTER SUBWAY SERVICES#
B18 1040  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 1040  8       Many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-Main
B18 1050  5    Street express are daily confronted with the sight
B18 1060  3    of the local departing from the Woodside station as
B18 1060 12    their express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded
B18 1070  9    and strained. To the tens of thousands who must transfer
B18 1080  7    to ride to Seventy-fourth Street and change for the
B18 1090  5    IND, this takes a daily toll of time and temper.
B18 1100  1       The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation
B18 1110  1    "hold" lights at BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth
B18 1110 10    Street stations in Brooklyn. This "holds" the local
B18 1120  8    until the express passengers change trains. Without
B18 1130  5    question, this time and temper saver should be immediately
B18 1140  4    installed at the Woodside station. @
B18 1140 10    #PHONE SERVICE CRITICIZED#
B18 1160  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 1160  1       As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly,
B18 1160 12    from three to four hours a day.
B18 1170  6       In the last few years the telephone company has
B18 1180  2    managed to automate many areas of their service. It
B18 1180 11    has not been any great mental effort on my part to
B18 1190 10    keep up with this mechanization which has brought about
B18 1200  5    new ways of dialing.
B18 1200  9       However, there are still several types of calls
B18 1210  7    that necessitate the use of telephone operators. I
B18 1220  3    have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the
B18 1230  1    young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls,
B18 1230 10    special long-distance calls, etc. Either it is lack
B18 1240  7    of training, lack of proper screening when hiring,
B18 1250  4    lack of management or possibly lack of interest on
B18 1260  2    the part of the telephone company, which does have
B18 1260 11    a Government-blessed monopoly.
B18 1280  1    #FAIR-PRICED FUNERAL#
B18 1280  4    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1280  7       I disagree with the writer who says funeral services
B18 1290  6    should be government-controlled. The funeral for my
B18 1300  3    husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price,
B18 1300 15    far less than I had expected to pay. But the hospitals
B18 1310 11    and doctors should be. @
B18 1320  3    #HELPING RETARDED CHILDREN#
B18 1320  6    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1320  9       Recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School
B18 1330  8    for retarded children.
B18 1340  1       Hazel Park donates its recreation center, five days
B18 1340  9    a week, to the school. There is no charge and no state
B18 1350 12    aid. Kiwanis, American Legion and other groups donate
B18 1360  7    small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring
B18 1370  6    in dollars for its support.
B18 1370 11       There are 70 children there and the mothers donate
B18 1380  8    one day a week to the school. Reading, writing and
B18 1390  4    simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts
B18 1400  1    as working in brass. They make beautiful objects.
B18 1400  9       Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger
B18 1410 10    station wagon. Southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger
B18 1420  7    bus (the heater in which needs repair since some of
B18 1430  6    the children ride a long distance and need the heat).
B18 1440  3       The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile road, Woodward
B18 1450  1    Heights. Visitors are welcome to come see what these
B18 1450 10    dedicated mothers can do. @
B18 1460  5    #JOBS FOR CAVANAGH#
B18 1460  8    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1460 11       I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat, but perhaps
B18 1470  9    Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that
B18 1480  7    should have been done years ago. Maybe he can clean
B18 1490  6    out the white elephants in some of the city departments
B18 1500  2    such as welfare, DPW and sanitation. Negligence in
B18 1510  1    garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning
B18 1510  8    is great.
B18 1510 10       He should put the police back to patrolling and
B18 1520  9    walking the streets at night. There should be better
B18 1530  6    bus service and all of our city departments and their
B18 1540  3    various branches need a general and complete overhauling.
B18 1550  1       Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I
B18 1550  9    have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case.
B18 1560  9       Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should
B18 1570  6    be weeded out. Educate the city employes to give real
B18 1580  4    service to the public. After all, they are paid by
B18 1590  1    the public, they should be examples. @
B18 1590  8    #CHURCH FINDS NEWS FEATURES ARE HELPFUL#
B18 1600  3    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1600  6       At a recent meeting of the Women's Association of
B18 1610  3    the Trumbull Ave. United Presbyterian Church, considerable
B18 1620  3    use was made of material from The Detroit News on the
B18 1630  3    King James version of the New Testament versus the
B18 1630 12    New English Bible.
B18 1640  2       Some members of the organization called attention
B18 1650  1    also to the article on hymns of inspiration, the Daily
B18 1650 11    Prayer and Three Minutes a Day, as being very helpful.
B18 1660  9       We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented
B18 1670  8    upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we
B18 1680  6    hope that it will continue to provide material along
B18 1690  2    wholesome lines. @
B18 1690  5    #RUDE YOUNGSTERS#
B18 1700  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1700  1       Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on
B18 1700 10    the public apathy to impudence.
B18 1710  3       How old do you have to be to remember when Americans,
B18 1720  1    especially children, were encouraged to be polite?
B18 1720  8    Why has this form of gentility gone out of American
B18 1730  9    life?
B18 1730 10       How can we old-fashioned parents, who still feel
B18 1740  8    that adults are due some respect from children, battle
B18 1750  4    the new type of advertising that appears on TV without
B18 1760  3    denying the children the use of television entirely?
B18 1770  1    Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the
B18 1770 10    attitude of "modern" parents they have observed. From
B18 1780  6    necessity, they are also inspired by the "hard-sell"
B18 1790  5    attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it is the sponsor
B18 1800  4    who must take the responsibility for the good or bad
B18 1800 14    taste of his advertising. @

B18 1820  1       I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish
B18 1820 11    a national park in the dunes area.
