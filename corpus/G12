G12 0010  2    Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour. His
G12 0010 11    letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on
G12 0020 10    Sunday, and I came into the lobby as the clock struck
G12 0030  7    twelve. He was waiting.
G12 0030 11       My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted
G12 0040  8    by simple curiosity and interest in his work. American
G12 0050  5    newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic.
G12 0060  2    They find deep pessimism in them. Even so astute a
G12 0060 12    commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said
G12 0070  9    that "Waiting for Godot" is "the concentrate ... of
G12 0080  8    the contemporary European ... mood of despair". But
G12 0090  6    to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love
G12 0100  4    for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could
G12 0110  3    reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism. Could
G12 0110 11    it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me? Is
G12 0120 12    his a literature of defeat, irrelevant to the social
G12 0130  6    crises we face? Or is it relevant because it teaches
G12 0140  4    us something useful to know about ourselves?
G12 0150  1       I knew that a conversation with the author would
G12 0150 10    not settle such questions, because a man is not the
G12 0160  8    same as his writing: in the last analysis, the questions
G12 0170  4    had to be settled by the work itself. Nevertheless
G12 0180  1    I was curious.
G12 0180  4       My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the
G12 0190  3    interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed
G12 0190 13    teacher of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference
G12 0200  9    on religious drama near Paris. When Beckett's name
G12 0210  7    came into the discussion, the priest grew loud and
G12 0230  4    told me that Beckett "hates life". That, I thought,
G12 0240  3    is at least one thing I can find out when we meet.

G12 0250  1    Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish. The features
G12 0250  9    of his face are distinct, but not fine. They look as
G12 0260  9    if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel.
G12 0270  5    Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead, standing
G12 0280  3    so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show
G12 0290  1    that it really is hair and not bristle. One might say
G12 0290 12    it combines the man; own pride and humility. For he
G12 0300  9    has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the
G12 0310  5    humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to impose
G12 0320  2    himself upon another. His light blue eyes, set deep
G12 0320 11    within the face, are actively and continually looking.
G12 0330  7    He seems, by some unconscious division of labor, to
G12 0340  5    have given them that one function and no other, leaving
G12 0350  3    communication to the rest of the face. The mouth frequently
G12 0360  1    breaks into a disarming smile. The voice is light in
G12 0360 11    timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.
G12 0370  9    The Irish accent is, as one would expect, combined
G12 0380  6    with slight inflections from the French. His tweed
G12 0390  3    suit was a baggy gray and green. He wore a brown knit
G12 0400  1    sports shirt with no tie.
G12 0400  6       We walked down the Rue de L'Arcade, thence along
G12 0410  3    beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe
G12 0420  1    opposite that church. The conversation that ensued
G12 0420  8    may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called
G12 0430  7    world-shattering. For one thing, the world that Beckett
G12 0440  5    sees is already shattered. His talk turns to what he
G12 0450  3    calls "the mess", or sometimes "this buzzing confusion".
G12 0460  1    I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately
G12 0460  9    after our conversation. What appears here is shorter
G12 0470  7    than what he actually said but very close to his own
G12 0480  7    words.
G12 0480  8       "The confusion is not my invention. We cannot listen
G12 0490  5    to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely
G12 0500  3    aware of the confusion. It is all around us and our
G12 0510  1    only chance now is to let it in. The only chance of
G12 0510 13    renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess. It
G12 0520  9    is not a mess you can make sense of".
G12 0530  1       I suggested that one must let it in because it is
G12 0530 12    the truth, but Beckett did not take to the word truth.
G12 0540 10       "What is more true than anything else? To swim is
G12 0550  8    true, and to sink is true. One is not more true than
G12 0560  7    the other. One cannot speak anymore of being, one must
G12 0570  3    speak only of the mess. When Heidegger and Sartre speak
G12 0580  1    of a contrast between being and existence, they may
G12 0580 10    be right, I don't know, but their language is too philosophical
G12 0590  8    for me. I am not a philosopher. One can only speak
G12 0600  6    of what is in front of him, and that now is simply
G12 0610  4    the mess".
G12 0610  6       Then he began to speak about the tension in art
G12 0620  3    between the mess and form. Until recently, art has
G12 0620 12    withstood the pressure of chaotic things. It has held
G12 0630  9    them at bay. It realized that to admit them was to
G12 0640  7    jeopardize form. "How could the mess be admitted, because
G12 0650  4    it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore
G12 0660  2    destructive of the very thing that art holds itself
G12 0660 11    to be"? But now we can keep it out no longer, because
G12 0670 11    we have come into a time when "it invades our experience
G12 0680  7    at every moment. It is there and it must be allowed
G12 0690  6    in".
G12 0690  7       I granted this might be so, but found the result
G12 0700  4    to be even more attention to form than was the case
G12 0700 15    previously. And why not? How, I asked, could chaos
G12 0710  9    be admitted to chaos? Would not that be the end of
G12 0720  9    thinking and the end of art? If we look at recent art
G12 0730  7    we find it preoccupied with form. Beckett's own work
G12 0740  3    is an example. Plays more highly formalized than "Waiting
G12 0750  1    for Godot", "Endgame", and "Krapp's Last Tape" would
G12 0760  1    be hard to find.
G12 0760  5       "What I am saying does not mean that there will
G12 0770  2    henceforth be no form in art. It only means that there
G12 0770 13    will be new form, and that this form will be of such
G12 0780 12    a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to
G12 0790  8    say that the chaos is really something else. The form
G12 0800  4    and the chaos remain separate. The latter is not reduced
G12 0810  1    to the former. That is why the form itself becomes
G12 0810 11    a preoccupation, because it exists as a problem separate
G12 0820  8    from the material it accommodates. To find a form that
G12 0830  6    accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist
G12 0840  3    now".
G12 0840  4       Yet, I responded, could not similar things be said
G12 0850  3    about the art of the past? Is it not characteristic
G12 0850 13    of the greatest art that it confronts us with something
G12 0860  9    we cannot clarify, demanding that the viewer respond
G12 0870  6    to it in his own never-predictable way? What is the
G12 0880  5    history of criticism but the history of men attempting
G12 0890  1    to make sense of the manifold elements in art that
G12 0890 11    will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single
G12 0900  8    philosophy or a single aesthetic theory? Isn't all
G12 0910  4    art ambiguous?
G12 0910  6       "Not this", he said, and gestured toward the Madeleine.
G12 0920  6    The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought
G12 0930  4    of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all the scene where
G12 0940  4    we sat. The Boulevard de la Madeleine, the Boulevard
G12 0950  1    Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful
G12 0950 11    flattery, bearing tidings of the Age of Reason. "Not
G12 0960  9    this. This is clear. This does not allow the mystery
G12 0970  7    to invade us. With classical art, all is settled. But
G12 0980  5    it is different at Chartres. There is the unexplainable,
G12 0990  1    and there art raises questions that it does not attempt
G12 0990 11    to answer".
G12 1000  2       I asked about the battle between life and death
G12 1000 11    in his plays. Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide;
G12 1010 12    Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out
G12 1020 12    of it to join the living child outside. Is this life-death
G12 1030  7    question a part of the chaos?
G12 1040  1       "Yes. If life and death did not both present themselves
G12 1040 11    to us, there would be no inscrutability. If there were
G12 1050 10    only darkness, all would be clear. It is because there
G12 1060  8    is not only darkness but also light that our situation
G12 1070  5    becomes inexplicable. Take Augustine's doctrine of
G12 1080  2    grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the
G12 1080 11    dramatic qualities in this theology? Two thieves are
G12 1090  8    crucified with Christ, one saved and the other damned.
G12 1100  7    How can we make sense of this division? In classical
G12 1110  4    drama, such problems do not arise. The destiny of Racine's
G12 1120  3    Phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed
G12 1130  1    into the dark. As she goes, she herself will be illuminated.
G12 1130 12    At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination
G12 1140 10    and at the end she has complete illumination, but there
G12 1150  7    has been no question but that she moves toward the
G12 1160  5    dark. That is the play. Within this notion clarity
G12 1170  1    is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist
G12 1170 12    there is not such clarity. The question would also
G12 1180  9    be removed if we believed in the contrary- total salvation.
G12 1190  6    But where we have both dark and light we have also
G12 1200  6    the inexplicable. The key word in my plays is 'perhaps'".
G12 1210  2    ##
G12 1210  3    Given a theological lead, I asked what he thinks about
G12 1220  3    those who find a religious significance to his plays.
G12 1220 12       "Well, really there is none at all. I have no religious
G12 1230 12    feeling. Once I had a religious emotion. It was at
G12 1240 10    my first Communion. No more. My mother was deeply religious.
G12 1250  8    So was my brother. He knelt down at his bed as long
G12 1260  7    as he could kneel. My father had none. The family was
G12 1270  3    Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let
G12 1270 14    it go. My brother and mother got no value from their
G12 1280 11    religion when they died. At the moment of crisis it
G12 1290  8    had no more depth than an old-school tie. Irish Catholicism
G12 1300  4    is not attractive, but it is deeper. When you pass
G12 1310  3    a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the
G12 1310 15    sign of the cross. One day the dogs of Ireland will
G12 1320 10    do that too and perhaps also the pigs".
G12 1330  4       But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience
G12 1340  3    religion must also deal with?
G12 1340  8       "Yes, for they deal with distress. Some people object
G12 1350  7    to this in my writing. At a party an English intellectual-
G12 1360  5    so-called- asked me why I write always about distress.
G12 1370  4    As if it were perverse to do so! He wanted to know
G12 1380  3    if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away
G12 1380 15    from home to give me an unhappy childhood. I told him
G12 1390 10    no, that I had had a very happy childhood. Then he
G12 1400  5    thought me more perverse than ever. I left the party
G12 1410  3    as soon as possible and got into a taxi. On the glass
G12 1410 15    partition between me and the driver were three signs:
G12 1420  9    one asked for help for the blind, another help for
G12 1430  7    orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees.
G12 1440  4    One does not have to look for distress. It is screaming
G12 1450  1    at you even in the taxis of London".
G12 1450  9       Lunch was over, and we walked back to the hotel
G12 1460  8    with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us.
G12 1470  3    ##
G12 1470  4    The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to
G12 1480  2    qualities I had found in the plays. He says nothing
G12 1480 12    that compresses experience within a closed pattern.
G12 1490  6    "Perhaps" stands in place of commitment. At the same
G12 1500  7    time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly friendly.
G12 1510  2    If there were only the mess, all would be clear; but
G12 1520  1    there is also compassion.
G12 1520  5       As a Christian, I know I do not stand where Beckett
G12 1530  4    stands, but I do see much of what he sees. As a writer
G12 1540  2    on the theater, I have paid close attention to the
G12 1540 12    plays. Harold Clurman is right to say that "Waiting
G12 1550  8    for Godot" is a reflection (he calls it a distorted
G12 1560  6    reflection) "of the impasse and disarray of Europe's
G12 1570  3    present politics, ethic, and common way of life". Yet
G12 1580  2    it is not only Europe the play refers to. "Waiting
G12 1580 12    for Godot" sells even better in America than in France.
G12 1590  9    The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier
G12 1600  7    to Europe than to America, but it is the consciousness
G12 1610  4    that most "mature" societies arrive at when their successes
G12 1620  3    in technological and economic systematization propel
G12 1630  1    them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical
G12 1630 11    ends of culture. America is now joining Europe in this
G12 1640  8    "mature" phase of development. Whether any of us remain
G12 1660  6    in it long will depend on what happens as a result
G12 1670  4    of the technological and economic revolutions now going
G12 1680  1    on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of
G12 1680 12    course on how long the cold war remains cold.
