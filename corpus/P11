P11 0010  2    SUCH a little thing to start with- the car registration.
P11 0020  1       "Ida, where is the car license"? she asked. "I can't
P11 0030  1    find it in the glove compartment".
P11 0030  7       "Via must have it", I answered readily enough, recalling
P11 0040  6    her last visit.
P11 0040  9       "Via", she was frowning. "Why should Via have it"?
P11 0050  9       Had she forgotten she had signed the car away, that
P11 0060 10    whatever they mutually owned had been divided among
P11 0070  6    the children?
P11 0070  8       I was silent. I didn't want to stir things up.
P11 0080  7       "I drive my own car by courtesy of Via"?
P11 0090  3       "I'm sure she'd turn it over to you, if you'd rather.
P11 0100  4    You know that".
P11 0100  7       She looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud.
P11 0110  6       "She must have taken the registration when she went
P11 0120  4    to Walter's. I'll call her".
P11 0120  9       "No, thank you. I want nothing of Via's".
P11 0130  8       Why should this suddenly assail her? Walter was
P11 0140  6    giving me checks for my pay, the household bills. Had
P11 0150  4    she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her
P11 0160  2    mind?
P11 0160  3       "What a fool I've been", she said quietly. "I knew
P11 0170  3    all this, but I paid no attention. I don't even own
P11 0170 14    the house I'm standing in. I was so sure it was all
P11 0180 12    temporary ... that we would all embrace, and then the
P11 0190  8    lawyer would tear up all those things ...
P11 0200  2       "It narrows down down down and finally there is
P11 0200 11    no way out. If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing".
P11 0220  1       I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured
P11 0220 11    remark, but it seemed one of those extreme statements
P11 0230  9    women under stress indulge in. I love you, I hate you,
P11 0240  8    I feel like killing you and myself, and in the same
P11 0250  5    sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful
P11 0260  1    the most noble and so on and on, meanwhile eating a
P11 0260 12    good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living. So I
P11 0270  8    went about my business. I made a lemon sponge, a light
P11 0280  6    dessert, roasted a chicken, parboiled some frozen vegetables,
P11 0290  3    so there would be something nice in the icebox for
P11 0300  1    the weekend. "Don't bother, Ida", she said. "I have
P11 0300 10    these appointments in town for Saturday, and I'll probably
P11 0310  9    spend Sunday with Dolly or the Thaxters".
P11 0320  6       At last, I thought, she's recovering her spirits.
P11 0330  4    With this movie-to-be in London, and new faces about
P11 0340  2    her there, she would soon be a more tranquil, a wiser
P11 0340 13    person, all the better for her stay out here. I felt
P11 0350 11    more cheerful, as if I had had a part in bringing her
P11 0360  8    through to a greater tolerance of herself. And I went
P11 0370  4    back to my own cottage to live my own little patch
P11 0380  1    of life.
P11 0380  3       It was foggy that evening, but the path to my house
P11 0380 14    was so well grooved that I could feel my way, accustomed
P11 0390 11    as I was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed
P11 0400 10    palisades of the river and sometimes last for days.
P11 0410  6    In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go
P11 0420  5    to the village I crept along with my headlights full
P11 0420 15    on.
P11 0430  1       I did notice a twinkle of light from the big house
P11 0430 12    through the woods but as I had left a light on in my
P11 0440 12    own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter
P11 0450  6    had done the same before she left for town. I did my
P11 0460  5    shopping, had my dentist appointment, and from there
P11 0460 13    I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where
P11 0470 11    we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar,
P11 0480  7    so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home
P11 0490  6    in the late afternoon.
P11 0490 10       But the next day- Sunday. Why, when I drove down
P11 0500  7    to church, didn't it speak to me, seeing the lights
P11 0510  6    still on and the day crisp and clear? Prisoners brought
P11 0520  2    to the dock accused of murder or accident say they
P11 0520 12    cannot remember, and reading the accounts of their
P11 0530  8    testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove,
P11 0540  6    absent itself, unsee. When I came back from church
P11 0550  3    at noon Mrs. Thaxter was turning into the Salter driveway.
P11 0560  1    Even at a car's length I could sense that something
P11 0560 11    was wrong, and so I followed her up to the turnaround
P11 0570 10    in front of the house.
P11 0580  1       Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and
P11 0580 10    she came running toward us.
P11 0590  4       "She's nowhere, nowhere"! she screamed, and both
P11 0600  3    women ran up to the house, and I followed.
P11 0600 12       The search began, in all the rooms, running upstairs,
P11 0610  9    down, opening closets, talking, exclaiming in rushes
P11 0620  5    and gasps.
P11 0620  7       Everything was as I had left it the night before
P11 0630  8    last- her portfolio and bag for town, her lingerie
P11 0640  3    and dress and shoes laid out ... only her mink coat
P11 0640 14    was missing. And she.
P11 0650  4       Then the telephoning began. I, who until that day
P11 0660  3    before had been Mrs. Salter's friend, her equal, was
P11 0660 12    the servant now. It was Dolly and Mrs. Thaxter who
P11 0670 10    were calling Via, everybody. And when they spoke they
P11 0680  7    spoke to each other and not to me. And after I brought
P11 0690  7    them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place
P11 0700  4    in the kitchen and wait.
P11 0700  9       Sitting in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs.
P11 0710  6    Salter said that could have been a sign to me. "If
P11 0720  4    I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing". Why
P11 0730  2    didn't that alarm me then? And when she returned from
P11 0730 12    taking her guests back to New York she had said, "All
P11 0740 11    they talked about was Harvie ... Harvie this, Harvie
P11 0750  7    that ... When they know the truth will they drop away
P11 0760  6    from me, will I become a nothing"? And then I remembered
P11 0770  4    a few years before after their return from a short
P11 0780  1    trip to Rome I had heard her boast, over and over again,
P11 0780 13    "On the boat people liked me for myself".
P11 0790  7       I had made a habit of calling her at night from
P11 0800  5    my cottage, just to check. The last night I had called,
P11 0810  3    but the line was always busy and it reassured me. I
P11 0810 14    assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations
P11 0820  9    with Dolly or Constance, she comfortable in bed. But
P11 0830  6    it seemed not from what they were saying. Then was
P11 0840  3    it a final desperate plea from her, to whom? ... hanging
P11 0850  1    on and on past any man's patience ... some final stab
P11 0850 12    of conclusion? @
P11 0860  2       She was found the day after at the bottom of the
P11 0860 13    cliff. I tried to believe that what must have happened
P11 0870 10    was that, restless, disturbed by this telephone call
P11 0880  6    or whatever, she walked out in the night, as she had
P11 0890  5    a habit of doing. Sometimes she took the path that
P11 0900  1    winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge
P11 0900 12    of the cliff. It's so romantic up there, she used to
P11 0910  8    say, with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack
P11 0920  4    like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of
P11 0930  1    the night, so poetic. With all that warm rain and the
P11 0930 12    fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock,
P11 0940  8    a misstep.
P11 0940 10       But I didn't really think it was as simple as that,
P11 0950  9    nor did anyone else. When a fisherman brought her up
P11 0960  5    in his arms, still, small, as if she were a child asleep,
P11 0970  3    I began to shudder with a terrible excitement, almost
P11 0970 12    triumphant, that I still cannot account for. Was it
P11 0980  9    a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance
P11 0990  7    of those weeks? that at last the vigilance, the will
P11 1000  4    gives way? Or what was it that, before Via, Sonny,
P11 1010  2    Walter and all, I began almost to dance with shuddering
P11 1010 12    and cry out, "I knew she'd do it! I knew"!
P11 1020 10       Everyone stared at me and drew back. Their eyes
P11 1030  8    turned cold and accusing, even Via's. And they have
P11 1040  5    never changed.
P11 1040  7       At the same time that I thought I understood her
P11 1050  4    at long last and pitied her, underneath this knowing
P11 1060  1    had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate,
P11 1060 12    an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry?
P11 1070  9    Was that what had given way in me? Even now I am appalled
P11 1080  9    at how little anyone knows of what they really are.
P11 1090  6    It is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation
P11 1100  2    estranged me from the family I considered my very own,
P11 1100 12    but there it hangs, a cooling void that broke our close
P11 1110 11    connection with each other. At the time I was filled
P11 1120  9    with self-pity at this separation, but in the years
P11 1130  5    since I have come to understand that the sight of me
P11 1140  3    was painful to them after that outcry. In my person
P11 1140 13    they would always remember that last long time of me
P11 1150  9    alone with her, so if they told themselves that I could
P11 1160  6    have prevented it, I can understand that by now and
P11 1170  4    love them still, because everyone must justify, have
P11 1170 12    a scapegoat for what is not to be borne.
P11 1180  8       It is not their avoidance that rankles; it is when
P11 1190  6    I meet someone who was a close friend of the family,
P11 1210  2    and therefore of mine, and they nod to me so coolly
P11 1210 13    and walk away, that it hurts. I could tell them, but
P11 1220  9    no one ever asked, why I had cried out so triumphantly
P11 1230  5    at the sight of her body. No, I forget Mrs. Mathias,
P11 1240  3    who had been away visiting a married daughter when
P11 1250  1    it happened. She haunted me; she persisted in explaining
P11 1250 10    how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to
P11 1260  9    the country.
P11 1260 11       "We all feel guilty", I turned away from her coldly.
P11 1270 10    "It was nobody's fault. She overplayed her hand".
P11 1280  6       "What do you mean"? she frowned.
P11 1290  3       "Why put such a high value on being top dog"? I
P11 1300  3    added. It was coarse, almost insulting, this harsh
P11 1300 11    appraisal, and she has never come to see me since.
P11 1310 10       But suppose she had not taken Mrs. Mathias' advice
P11 1320  7    and lived on like thousands of women in towns, dispossessed
P11 1330  6    of love, hanging on to makeshifts, and altogether and
P11 1340  3    finally arid. If she chose, and in that final decision
P11 1350  1    discarded, what, above all, all of us value, life itself,
P11 1350 11    must she not have risen to her fullest height, and
P11 1360  9    transcending her murky self, felt at last the passion
P11 1370  6    of a great moral decision? If they say I could have
P11 1380  3    stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her
P11 1380 13    last weeks of self-examination, her search into herself
P11 1390  8    and its conclusions.
P11 1400  1       Yes, I had cried out that I knew she'd do it, but
P11 1400 13    without my fully realizing it at the time, it was a
P11 1410 11    cry of triumph for her, praise at her deliverance from
P11 1420  5    pettiness and greed- and guilt. She was finally at
P11 1430  3    rest in truth, of her own proud free choice. At rest
P11 1430 14    with my darling Ellen, the first Mrs. Salter.
P11 1440  8    ##
P11 1440  9    MR. SALTER came home. The funeral service was in the
P11 1450  9    house, the Methodist minister, how clean and glistening
P11 1460  5    his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that
P11 1470  3    coffin with that doll inside, a stranger speaking to
P11 1480  1    strangers the old sacred words, and the rain drumming
P11 1480 10    incessantly in accompaniment, seven days of relentless
P11 1490  6    rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had
P11 1500  6    to be postponed. I waited. Then Via called to say they
P11 1510  3    had decided to cremate her- as they had Ellen, the
P11 1510 13    thought leaped to my mind- and did I want to meet her
P11 1520 12    at the funeral home the next morning.
P11 1530  4       The coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the
P11 1540  2    long low dimly lit funeral parlor, on its dark shining
P11 1540 12    surface the sheaf of white roses I had ordered. I knelt,
P11 1550 10    just for decency I thought at the time, but found myself
P11 1560  8    whispering, "Our Father which Art in Heaven ..." And
P11 1570  6    it was only after that that something unlocked in me
P11 1580  3    and I felt a grief.
P11 1580  8       Via was in the parking lot when I went outside.
P11 1590  4    Together we waited in her car until the hearse moved
P11 1600  1    out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic
P11 1600 11    of New Jersey.
P11 1610  1       By the time we arrived and entered the building
P11 1610 10    sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like
P11 1620  9    auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths.
P11 1630  5    Again I felt impelled to kneel, and reached back and
P11 1640  5    pulled Via down. Something would come into her heart
P11 1650  2    ... if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her
P11 1650 13    some healing.
