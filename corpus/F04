F04 0010  1       "THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to
F04 0010 13    be here"!
F04 0020  1       So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his
F04 0020 13    parents from North Country School, Lake Placid, New
F04 0030  8    York. In this one sentence, he unwittingly revealed
F04 0040  6    the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological
F04 0050  3    programs in operation at the school.
F04 0060  1       Because the food is selected with thought for its
F04 0060  9    nutritional value, care for its origin, and prepared
F04 0070  6    in a manner that retains the most nutrients, the food
F04 0080  3    does taste good. When served in a psychological atmosphere
F04 0090  2    that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest
F04 0090 10    good from what they eat because they are free from
F04 0100  9    tension, a foundation is laid for a high level of health
F04 0110  7    that releases the children from physical handicaps
F04 0120  2    to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments,
F04 0120 10    the athletic programs and the most important phase,
F04 0130  8    the educational opportunities.
F04 0140  1       Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain
F04 0150  1    scenery in the country, the school buildings are located
F04 0150 10    amid open fields and farm lands. These contemporary
F04 0160  6    structures, beautifully adapted to a school in the
F04 0170  5    country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen,
F04 0180  1    grades four through eight. From fourteen states and
F04 0180  9    three foreign countries they come to spend the months
F04 0190  8    from mid-September to June.
F04 0200  1       The Director, Walter E. Clark, believes that a school
F04 0210  1    with children living full time in its care must take
F04 0210 11    full responsibility for their welfare. To him this
F04 0220  7    means caring for the whole child, providing basic nutrition,
F04 0230  4    and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the
F04 0240  3    development of the mind.
F04 0240  7    #IMPROVED FARMING METHODS#
F04 0240 10    The concept of good nutrition really began with the
F04 0250  9    garden. The school has always maintained a farm to
F04 0260  6    supply the needs of the school. In a climate hostile
F04 0270  2    to agriculture, Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to
F04 0270 12    the most productive farm techniques.
F04 0280  5       Where a growing season may, with luck, allow 60
F04 0290  5    days without frost, and where the soil is poor, sandy,
F04 0300  2    quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail.
F04 0300 11    Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes
F04 0310  7    and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their
F04 0320  5    owners met defeat.
F04 0320  8       Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep
F04 0330  7    plowing, use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides,
F04 0340  3    plus the application of conservation principles of
F04 0350  2    rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion
F04 0350 10    in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil.
F04 0360  7       "To give up these notions required a revolution
F04 0370  5    in thought", Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the
F04 0380  3    abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began
F04 0390  1    reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition"
F04 0390  7    in a search for help with his problems.
F04 0400  7       "Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist".
F04 0410  6    By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray.
F04 0420  5    He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still
F04 0430  2    remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward
F04 0430  9    H. Faulkner, he stopped plowing.
F04 0440  5       The basis for compost materials already existed
F04 0450  3    on the school farm with a stable of animals for the
F04 0460  1    riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage,
F04 0460 10    a beef herd and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails
F04 0470  8    were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg
F04 0480  5    shells.
F04 0480  6       All these materials and supplementary manure and
F04 0490  3    other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry
F04 0500  1    farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year.
F04 0500 11    It was applied with a compost shredder made from a
F04 0510  8    converted manure spreader.
F04 0520  1       Years of patient application of compost and leaf
F04 0520  8    mulching has changed the structure of the soil and
F04 0530  7    its water-holding capacity. Soon after the method changed,
F04 0540  4    visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his
F04 0550  2    soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it
F04 0550 12    was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this.
F04 0560  5       To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens
F04 0570  5    as it is today, Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful
F04 0580  4    of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting
F04 0590  1    it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed
F04 0590 11    to the nearby driveway and said, "This soil used to
F04 0600  8    be like that hard packed road over there".
F04 0610  4       "People and soils respond slowly", says Walter Clark,
F04 0620  3    "but the time has now come when the gardens produce
F04 0630  1    delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment
F04 0630  9    program. No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides
F04 0640  6    and fungicides are used".
F04 0650  2       The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas,
F04 0660  1    potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter
F04 0660 10    meals in the root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't
F04 0670  7    make it through the winter; the cabbage and squash
F04 0680  5    keep until March or April. There is never enough corn,
F04 0690  3    peas or strawberries.
F04 0690  6       Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes
F04 0700  6    grown on the least fertile fields, but he has watched
F04 0710  3    the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that
F04 0710 11    continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow
F04 0720  9    him to do without it in the future. A new project planned
F04 0740  6    is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.
F04 0750  1       New ideas for improving nutrition came with the
F04 0750  9    study of soil treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen",
F04 0760  7    says Mr. Clark. The first major change was that of
F04 0770  7    providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread.
F04 0780  3       "Adults take a long time to convince and you are
F04 0790  1    thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen
F04 0790 11    help was tolerant, but ordered their own supply of
F04 0800  7    white bread for themselves. "You can't make French
F04 0810  4    toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early complaint.
F04 0820  2    Of course they learned in time that they not only could
F04 0820 13    use whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better.
F04 0830 10    #HOMEMADE BREAD#
F04 0840  1    Mrs. Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and
F04 0840 10    cared for the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came
F04 0850  8    from Vermont to be kitchen manager. Today whole grains
F04 0860  6    are freshly ground every day and baked into bread.
F04 0870  4    Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to
F04 0880  3    conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt
F04 0880 12    use of the flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin
F04 0890  8    E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it
F04 0900  6    is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within
F04 0910  3    one week.
F04 0910  5       A mill stands in a room off the kitchen. Surrounding
F04 0920  2    it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms
F04 0920 12    in the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat,
F04 0930 10    oats, and soy beans and turns on the motor. She goes
F04 0940  9    on about her work and listens for the completion of
F04 0950  5    the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture is
F04 0960  2    light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked
F04 0960 13    by the children and faculty.
F04 0970  3       There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's
F04 0980  1    bread is so good and everything tastes so much better
F04 0980 11    here that it is hard not to eat too much", said the
F04 0990 12    secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds.
F04 1000  4    #HOT, FRESHLY-GROUND CEREAL#
F04 1000  8    The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years,
F04 1010  8    though at one time that was all they ever served. When
F04 1020  6    the chance came, they first eliminated cold cereal
F04 1030  3    once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground
F04 1040  1    cereal every day.
F04 1040  4       They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal. Occasionally,
F04 1050  2    the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal
F04 1060  1    which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the
F04 1060 10    school year, the new students don't eat the cereal
F04 1070  8    right away, but within a short time they are eating
F04 1080  5    it voraciously.
F04 1080  7       When they leave for vacations they miss the hot
F04 1090  5    cereal. The school has received letters from parents
F04 1100  2    asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to
F04 1100 11    like any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants.
F04 1110 11    Where can we get this cereal he likes so much"?
F04 1120  8    #BODY-BUILDING FOODS#
F04 1120 11    Salads are served at least once a day. Vegetables are
F04 1130 10    served liberally. Most come from the root cellar or
F04 1140  7    from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut is served once
F04 1150  4    a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads
F04 1160  1    and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat
F04 1160 10    is added to bread and causes the children to remark,
F04 1170  8    "Lillian, did you put nuts in the bread today"?
F04 1180  5       Milk appears twice a day. The school raises enough
F04 1190  3    poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs.
F04 1200  1    Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served.
F04 1200 11    Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with
F04 1210  9    them for their fertility.
F04 1220  1       Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue
F04 1220 10    and heart are planned once a week. Also, salt water
F04 1230  8    fish is on the table once a week.
F04 1240  1       For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once
F04 1240 10    a week. Most other desserts are fruit in some form,
F04 1250  9    fresh fruits once daily at least, sometimes at snack
F04 1260  6    time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources where
F04 1270  2    they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come
F04 1271  1    from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed.
F04 1280 10    Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly
F04 1290  6    from an organic farm.
F04 1290 10       Finding sources for these high quality foods is
F04 1300  8    a problem. Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected
F04 1310  5    ways. Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York
F04 1320  5    State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man from
F04 1330  2    the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to
F04 1330 11    the school from Vermont.
F04 1340  3       Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used
F04 1350  2    in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat
F04 1350 12    loaves. Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers
F04 1360  7    so that kelp can be available at the tables. Raw wheat-germ
F04 1370  7    is available on the breakfast table for the children
F04 1380  4    to help themselves.
F04 1380  7       Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt
F04 1390  7    and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals is also
F04 1400  3    discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the
F04 1400 11    tables.
F04 1410  1       Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there
F04 1410 10    is no necessity to remove insecticide residues. The
F04 1420  6    cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin C content
F04 1430  6    of vegetables by methods which use very little water
F04 1440  3    and cook in the shortest time possible.
F04 1440 10    #WHOLESOME SNACKS, NO CANDY#
F04 1450  3    Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of
F04 1460  2    hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw
F04 1460 11    vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out
F04 1470  8    with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time
F04 1480  5    in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the wheat
F04 1490  2    grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot,
F04 1490 10    a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was
F04 1500  8    invented to hold the grains.
F04 1510  1       On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains,
F04 1510  9    the children carry whole grains to munch along the
F04 1520  8    trail. They learn to like these so well that it isn't
F04 1540  7    surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was
F04 1550  4    feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to
F04 1550 14    him, so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his
F04 1560 11    cereal bowl with milk and honey.
F04 1570  3       Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods
F04 1580  1    on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary
F04 1580 11    refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is
F04 1590  9    used in cooking. Candy is not allowed. Parents are
F04 1600  5    asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting
F04 1610  2    of fruit and nuts, but no candy.
F04 1610  9    #NOURISHING MEALS#
F04 1620  1    Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit,
F04 1620 11    hot cereal, milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real
F04 1630  8    butter and eggs. The heavy meal comes in the middle
F04 1640  6    of the day. Soup is often the important dish at supper.
F04 1650  3    Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich
F04 1650 12    in dissolved minerals and vitamins.
F04 1660  4       The school finds that the children are satisfied
F04 1670  3    with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high
F04 1680  1    in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under
F04 1680 12    one dollar a day.
F04 1690  2    #OUTDOOR EXERCISES#
F04 1690  4    Even before he saw the necessity of growing better
F04 1700  2    food and planning good nutrition, Mr. Clark felt the
F04 1700 11    school had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise
F04 1710  9    for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather
F04 1720 10    was the rule. A vigorous program existed in skiing,
F04 1730  5    skating sports and overnight hiking.
F04 1730 10    #HEALTHIER CHILDREN#
F04 1740  2    Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he can
F04 1750  2    report on improvements in health, though he considers
F04 1750 10    the following statements observations and not scientific
F04 1760  6    proof.
F04 1760  7       Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use
F04 1770  8    on the children's hair to bring out the sheen. The
F04 1780  5    ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.
