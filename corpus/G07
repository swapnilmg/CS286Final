G07 0010  2    ONCE again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers,
G07 0010 12    America faces a stern test. That test, as President
G07 0020  9    Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the
G07 0030  8    Union message, will determine "whether a nation organized
G07 0040  4    and governed such as ours can endure".
G07 0050  1       It is well then that in this hour both of "national
G07 0050 12    peril" and of "national opportunity" we can take counsel
G07 0060  9    with the men who made the nation. Incapable of self-delusion,
G07 0070  8    the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time
G07 0080  7    to be equally grave, and yet they had confidence that
G07 0090  3    America would surmount it and that a republic of free
G07 0100  1    peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a
G07 0100 11    world aching for liberty.
G07 0110  1       Seven Founders- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,
G07 0120  1    John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James
G07 0130  1    Madison and John Jay- determined the destinies of the
G07 0130 10    new nation. In certain respects, their task was incomparably
G07 0140  8    greater than ours today, for there was nobody before
G07 0150  6    them to show them the way. As Madison commented to
G07 0160  3    Jefferson in 1789, "We are in a wilderness without
G07 0170  1    a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will
G07 0170 10    have an easier task".
G07 0180  1       They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words,
G07 0190  1    as "the Argonauts" who had lived in "the Heroic Age".
G07 0190 11    Accordingly, they took special pains to preserve their
G07 0200  8    papers as essential sources for posterity. Their writings
G07 0210  6    assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because
G07 0220  4    of their conviction that the struggle in which they
G07 0230  3    were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but,
G07 0230 11    rather, as Washington in his last wartime circular
G07 0240  8    reminded his fellow countrymen, that "with our fate
G07 0250  5    will the destiny of unborn millions be involved".
G07 0260  1       Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point
G07 0270  1    of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven
G07 0270  8    were essentially congenial minds, and their agreements
G07 0280  6    with each other were more consequential than their
G07 0290  3    differences. Even though in most cases the completion
G07 0300  1    of the definitive editions of their writings is still
G07 0300 10    years off, enough documentation has already been assembled
G07 0310  7    to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership
G07 0320  8    which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American
G07 0330  5    independence and founding a new nation.
G07 0340  1       Before merging them into a common profile it is
G07 0340 10    well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary.
G07 0350  7    Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any
G07 0360  6    later period achieved so much in so concentrated a
G07 0370  4    span of years.
G07 0370  7       Eldest of the seven, Benjamin Franklin, a New Englander
G07 0380  5    transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the most dazzling
G07 0390  3    success story in our history. The young printer's apprentice
G07 0400  1    achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields,
G07 0400  9    as editor and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist
G07 0410  6    and statesman. Author of the Albany Plan of Union,
G07 0420  8    which, had it been adopted, might have avoided the
G07 0430  4    Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line battles
G07 0440  2    in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France
G07 0440 11    and the peace that ended the war, headed the state
G07 0450 10    government of Pennsylvania, and exercised an important
G07 0460  5    moderating influence at the Federal Convention.
G07 0470  2    ##
G07 0470  3    ON a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful
G07 0480  3    George Washington touched off the French and Indian
G07 0490  1    War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of
G07 0490 10    its militia. Commanding the Continental Army for six
G07 0500  7    long years of the Revolution, he was the indispensable
G07 0510  5    factor in the ultimate victory. Retiring to his beloved
G07 0520  4    Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal
G07 0530  1    Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously
G07 0530 12    elected President. During his two terms the Constitution
G07 0540  8    was tested and found workable, strong national policies
G07 0550  6    were inaugurated, and the traditions and powers of
G07 0560  5    the Presidential office firmly fixed.
G07 0570  1       John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical
G07 0570  8    ideology, wrote the constitution of his home state
G07 0580  7    of Massachusetts, negotiated, with Franklin and Jay,
G07 0590  5    the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice
G07 0600  2    President and our second President.
G07 0600  7    ##
G07 0600  8    HIS political opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas
G07 0610  6    Jefferson, achieved immortality through his authorship
G07 0620  4    of the Declaration of Independence, but equally notable
G07 0630  3    were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted
G07 0640  1    in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial
G07 0640 12    system, and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory
G07 0650  8    during his first term as President.
G07 0660  4       During the greater part of Jefferson's career he
G07 0670  3    enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian,
G07 0670 11    James Madison, eight years his junior. The active sponsor
G07 0680  9    of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia,
G07 0690  7    Madison played the most influential single role in
G07 0700  5    the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its
G07 0710  3    ratification in Virginia, founded the first political
G07 0720  1    party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary
G07 0720  9    of State and his successor in the Presidency, guided
G07 0730  8    the nation through the troubled years of our second
G07 0740  6    war with Britain.
G07 0740  9       If Franklin was an authentic genius, then Alexander
G07 0750  6    Hamilton, with his exceptional precocity, consuming
G07 0760  3    energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy.
G07 0770  1    His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was
G07 0770  8    only 19, quickly brought him to the attention of the
G07 0780  8    patriot leaders. Principal author of "The Federalist",
G07 0790  4    he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution
G07 0800  4    to ratification almost single-handedly. His collaboration
G07 0810  2    with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide
G07 0820  1    during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered
G07 0820  9    the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. His
G07 0830  7    bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of
G07 0840  3    the Constitution stand as durable contributions.
G07 0850  1    ##
G07 0850  2    LESS dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson,
G07 0860  1    John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding
G07 0860 11    Fathers. He served as president of the Continental
G07 0870  8    Congress. He played the leading role in negotiating
G07 0880  6    the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution,
G07 0890  4    and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the
G07 0900  2    Confederation period. As first Chief Justice, his strong
G07 0910  1    nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall. He
G07 0910  7    ended his public career as a two-term governor of New
G07 0920  9    York.
G07 0920 10       These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual
G07 0930  4    and social elite, the most respectable and disinterested
G07 0940  3    leadership any revolution ever confessed. Their social
G07 0950  2    status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with
G07 0950 12    Washington, Jefferson and Jay; in others by business
G07 0960  8    and professional acumen, as with Franklin and Adams,
G07 0970  6    or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential marriage.
G07 0980  2    Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in
G07 0990  2    underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded
G07 0990 10    both prestige and influence before the Revolution started.
G07 1000  7       As different physically as the tall, angular Jefferson
G07 1010  7    was from the chubby, rotund Adams, the seven were striking
G07 1020  6    individualists. Ardent, opinionated, even obstinate,
G07 1030  3    they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy,
G07 1040  1    and were masters of phrasemaking.
G07 1040  6    ##
G07 1040  7    CAPABLE of enduring friendships, they were also stout
G07 1050  5    controversialists, who could write with a drop of vitriol
G07 1060  5    on their pens. John Adams dismissed John Dickinson,
G07 1070  1    who voted against the Declaration of Independence,
G07 1070  8    as "a certain great fortune and piddling genius". Washington
G07 1080  7    castigated his critic, General Conway, as being capable
G07 1090  7    of "all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd
G07 1100  5    resentment of disappointed vanity". And Hamilton, who
G07 1110  3    felt it "a religious duty" to oppose Aaron Burr's political
G07 1120  2    ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk
G07 1120 10    had he shown more literary restraint.
G07 1130  6       The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to
G07 1140  4    the public service. Madison once remarked: "My life
G07 1150  3    has been so much a public one", a comment which fits
G07 1150 14    the careers of the other six. Franklin retired from
G07 1160  9    editing and publishing at the age of 42, and for the
G07 1170  9    next forty-two years devoted himself to public, scientific,
G07 1180  4    and philanthropic interests. Washington never had a
G07 1190  3    chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation
G07 1190 13    he loved best, plantation management. He served as
G07 1200  7    Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation.
G07 1210  5    ##
G07 1210  6    JOHN ADAMS took to heart the advice given him by his
G07 1220  9    legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, to "pursue the study
G07 1230  5    of the law, rather than the gain of it". In taking
G07 1240  2    account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded
G07 1250  1    that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business
G07 1250 11    as I did" and "for so little profit". When the Revolution
G07 1260  9    broke out, he, along with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned
G07 1270  6    his career at the bar, with considerable financial
G07 1280  2    sacrifice.
G07 1280  3       Hamilton, poorest of the seven, gave up a brilliant
G07 1290  5    law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet. While he
G07 1300  3    was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations
G07 1300 11    of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small
G07 1310 10    sums from friends. "If you can conveniently let me
G07 1320  7    have twenty dollars", he wrote one friend in 1791 when
G07 1330  6    he was Secretary of the Treasury.
G07 1330 12       To support his large family Hamilton went back to
G07 1340  9    the law after each spell of public service. Talleyrand
G07 1350  5    passed his New York law office one night on the way
G07 1360  5    to a party. Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting
G07 1370  1    a legal paper by the light of a candle. The Frenchman
G07 1370 12    was astonished. "I have just come from viewing a man
G07 1380  9    who had made the fortune of his country, but now is
G07 1390  7    working all night in order to support his family",
G07 1400  2    he reflected.
G07 1400  4    ##
G07 1400  5    ALL seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of
G07 1410  5    revolution with a profound respect for legality. John
G07 1420  1    Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration
G07 1420  8    of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in
G07 1430 10    accordance with their charters, the British Constitution
G07 1440  5    and the common law, and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration
G07 1450  5    of Independence "to the tribunal of the world" for
G07 1460  4    support of a revolution justified by "the laws of nature
G07 1470  2    and of nature's God".
G07 1470  6       They fought hard, but they were forgiving to former
G07 1480  4    foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures
G07 1490  1    from confiscating Tory property in violation of the
G07 1490  9    Treaty of 1783.
G07 1500  2       This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly
G07 1500 10    exemplified in an exchange of letters between John
G07 1510  8    Jay and a Tory refugee, Peter Van Schaack. Jay had
G07 1520  6    participated in the decision that exiled his old friend
G07 1530  4    Van Schaack. Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory made
G07 1540  2    the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote
G07 1540 10    him from Paris, where he was negotiating the peace
G07 1550  8    settlement:
G07 1555  1       "As an independent American I considered all who
G07 1560  8    were not for us, and you amongst the rest, as against
G07 1570  6    us, yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be
G07 1580  4    the friend of Peter Van Schaack".
G07 1580 10       The latter in turn assured him that "were I arraigned
G07 1590  9    at the bar, and you my judge, I should expect to stand
G07 1600  7    or fall only by the merits of my cause".
G07 1610  1       All seven recognized that independence was but the
G07 1610  9    first step toward building a nation. "We have now a
G07 1620 10    national character to establish", Washington wrote
G07 1630  5    in 1783. "Think continentally", Hamilton counseled
G07 1640  3    the young nation. This new force, love of country,
G07 1650  1    super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate
G07 1650  8    ties to one's own state, was epitomized by Washington.
G07 1660  7    His first inaugural address speaks of "my country whose
G07 1670  7    voice I can never hear but with veneration and love".
G07 1680  4       All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a
G07 1690  3    Federal Government with substantial powers. Save Jefferson,
G07 1700  1    all participated in the framing or ratification of
G07 1700  9    the Federal Constitution. They supported it, not as
G07 1710  7    a perfect instrument, but as the best obtainable. Historians
G07 1720  5    have traditionally regarded the great debates of the
G07 1730  4    Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized
G07 1740  1    vs. limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists
G07 1750  1    supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding
G07 1750  9    the latter position.
G07 1760  2    ##
G07 1760  3    THE state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson
G07 1770  2    and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves,
G07 1770 10    but in their later careers as heads of state the two
G07 1780 11    proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians.
G07 1790  4    In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's
G07 1800  5    broad construction of the Constitution, and so did
G07 1810  4    Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's
G07 1820  1    bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception,
G07 1820 11    and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff. Indeed,
G07 1830  7    the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the
G07 1840  7    Hamilton-oriented
G07 1840  9    Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats.
G07 1850  6    ##
G07 1850  7    WHEN, in 1832, the South Carolina nullifiers adopted
G07 1860  4    the principle of state interposition which Madison
G07 1870  3    had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited
G07 1880  1    no encouragement from that senior statesman. In his
G07 1880  9    political testament, "Advice to My Country", penned
G07 1890  6    just before his death, Madison expressed the wish "that
G07 1900  5    the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.
G07 1910  3    Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with
G07 1920  2    her box opened; and the disguised one, as the serpent
G07 1920 12    creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise".
