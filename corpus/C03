C03 0010  1       Francois D'Albert, Hungarian-born violinist who
C03 0010  7    made his New York debut three years ago, played a return
C03 0020 10    engagement last night in Judson Hall. He is now president
C03 0030  8    of the Chicago Conservatory College. His pianist was
C03 0040  5    Donald Jenni, a faculty member at DePaul University.
C03 0050  2       The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged
C03 0060  1    by the artists, so that for the first half of the program,
C03 0060 13    when the piano was partially open, Mr. Jenni's playing
C03 0070  8    was too loud. In vying with him, Mr. D'Albert also
C03 0080  7    seemed to be overdriving his tone.
C03 0090  2       This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment
C03 0090 10    of the performances, however, except in the case of
C03 0100  8    the opening work, Mozart's Sonata in A (K. 526), which
C03 0110  7    clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion.
C03 0120  4       Brahm's Sonata in A, although also vigorous, stood
C03 0130  3    up well under the two artists' strong, large-scale
C03 0140  1    treatment. Mr. D'Albert has a firm, attractive tone,
C03 0140  9    which eschews an overly sweet vibrato. He made the
C03 0150  8    most of the long Brahmsian phrases, and by the directness
C03 0160  6    and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance.
C03 0170  4       A Sonata for Violin and Piano, called "Bella Bella",
C03 0180  3    by Robert Fleming, was given its first United States
C03 0190  2    performance. The title refers to the nickname given
C03 0190 10    his wife by the composer, who is also a member of the
C03 0200 12    National Film Board of Canada. The work's two movements,
C03 0210  7    one melodically sentimental, the other brightly capricious,
C03 0220  5    are clever enough in a Ravel-like style, but they rehash
C03 0230  5    a wornout idiom. They might well indicate conjugal
C03 0240  1    felicity, but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.
C03 0250  1       Works by Dohnanyi, Hubay, Mr. D'Albert himself and
C03 0250  8    Paganini, indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso
C03 0260  8    fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude
C03 0270  7    toward a lyric phrase. Standard items by Sarasate and
C03 0280  4    Saint-Saens completed the program. @
C03 0290  1       IN recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New
C03 0290 11    York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium, but her
C03 0300  8    program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born
C03 0310  8    pianist's first New York recital since 1948.
C03 0320  3       Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard,
C03 0330  1    and in the twenty years since her debut here she has
C03 0330 12    gained the authority and inner assurance that lead
C03 0340  7    to audience control. And the tone she commands is always
C03 0350  6    beautiful in sound.
C03 0350  9       Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity
C03 0360  5    and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition,
C03 0370  3    Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure.
C03 0380  1    She played with style and a touch of the grand manner,
C03 0380 12    and every piece she performed was especially effective
C03 0390  7    in its closing measures.
C03 0400  1       The second half of her program was devoted to Russian
C03 0400 11    composers of this century. It was in them that Miss
C03 0410 10    Xydis was at her best. The Rachmaninoff Prelude No.
C03 0420  5    12, Op. 32, for instance, gave her an opportunity to
C03 0430  5    exploit one of her special facilities- the ability
C03 0440  2    to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting
C03 0440 11    them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the
C03 0450  8    treble.
C03 0450  9       The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured,
C03 0460  7    rich in color and songful. And the Prokofieff Seventh
C03 0470  5    Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern
C03 0480  3    bravura that Prokofieff needs.
C03 0480  7       Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's
C03 0500  5    Variations Serieuses, in which each variation was nicely
C03 0510  5    set off from the others; Haydn's Sonata in E minor,
C03 0520  4    which was unfailingly pleasant in sound, and Chopin's
C03 0530  1    Sonata in B flat minor. A memory lapse in the last
C03 0530 12    somewhat marred the pianist's performance. So what
C03 0540  7    was the deepest music on her program had the poorest
C03 0550  7    showing. Miss Xydis was best when she did not need
C03 0560  5    to be too probing.
C03 0570  1       ALL the generals who held important commands in
C03 0570  9    World War II did not write books. It only seems as
C03 0580 10    if they did. And the best books by generals were not
C03 0590  7    necessarily the first ones written. One of the very
C03 0600  4    best is only now published in this country, five years
C03 0610  1    after its first publication in England. It is "Defeat
C03 0610 10    Into Victory", by Field Marshal Viscount Slim.
C03 0620  6       A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities,
C03 0630  5    in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical
C03 0640  6    as it was originally. Field Marshal Slim has abridged
C03 0650  3    it for the benefit of "those who, finding not so great
C03 0660  1    an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves,
C03 0660 11    are more interested in men and their reactions to stress,
C03 0670  9    hardship and danger". The man whose reactions and conclusions
C03 0680  7    get the most space is, of course, the Field Marshal
C03 0690  5    himself.
C03 0690  6       William Joseph Slim, First Viscount Slim, former
C03 0700  5    Governor General of Australia, was the principal British
C03 0710  3    commander in the field during the Burma War. He had
C03 0720  2    been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat
C03 0720 10    and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared, ill-equipped
C03 0730  9    British forces "were outmaneuvered, outfought and outgeneraled".
C03 0740  4    He returned in command of an international army of
C03 0750  5    Gurkhas, Indians, Africans, Chinese and British. And
C03 0760  3    in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles
C03 0770  1    and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged
C03 0770 12    one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war. "The
C03 0780  7    Forgotten War" his soldiers called the Burma fighting
C03 0790  5    because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities
C03 0800  3    in equipment and in headlines.
C03 0800  8       Parts of "Defeat Into Victory" are a tangle of Burmese
C03 0810  8    place names and military units, but a little application
C03 0820  6    makes everything clear enough. On the whole this is
C03 0830  5    an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.
C03 0840  1    Field Marshal Slim is striking in description, amusing
C03 0840  9    in many anecdotes. He has a pleasant sense of humor
C03 0850  8    and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even "a
C03 0860  5    cardinal error". He praises many individuals generously.
C03 0870  2    He himself seems to be tough, tireless, able and intelligent,
C03 0880  1    more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.
C03 0880  9    #REMAKING AN ARMY TO WIN#
C03 0890  5    "Defeat Into Victory" is a dramatic and lively military
C03 0900  4    narrative. But it is most interesting in its account
C03 0920  1    of the unending problems of high command, of decisions
C03 0920 10    and their reasons, of the myriad matters that demand
C03 0930  8    attention in addition to battle action.
C03 0940  2       Before he could return to Burma, Field Marshal Slim
C03 0950  2    had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged
C03 0950 11    army and unite them with fresh recruits. His remarks
C03 0960  7    about training, discipline, morale, leadership and
C03 0970  4    command are enlightening. He believed in making inspiring
C03 0980  2    speeches and he made a great many. He believed in being
C03 0990  1    seen near the front lines and he was there. For general
C03 0990 12    morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his
C03 1000  8    supply officers, when food was short for combat troops
C03 1010  5    he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.
C03 1020  1       Other crucial matters required constant supervision:
C03 1030  1    labor and all noncombatant troops, whose morale was
C03 1030  9    vital, too; administrative organization and delicate
C03 1040  5    diplomatic relations with Top Brass- British, American
C03 1050  5    and Chinese; health, hygiene, medical aid and preventive
C03 1060  4    medicine; hospitals (inadequate) and nurses (scanty);
C03 1070  2    food and military supplies; logistics and transport;
C03 1080  1    airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be
C03 1080 10    built.
C03 1080 11    #EXPECTED OF A COMMANDER#
C03 1090  4    Commenting on these and other matters, Field Marshal
C03 1100  2    Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:
C03 1100  9       "When in doubt as to two courses of action, a general
C03 1110 11    should choose the bolder".
C03 1120  2       "The commander has failed in his duty if he has
C03 1130  2    not won victory- for that is his duty".
C03 1130 10       "It only does harm to talk to troops about new and
C03 1140 10    desirable equipment which others may have but which
C03 1150  6    you cannot give them. It depresses them. So I made
C03 1160  3    no mention of air transport until we could get at least
C03 1160 14    some of it".
C03 1170  3       Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage
C03 1180  1    of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their
C03 1180 12    commanders. Of the Japanese private he says: "He fought
C03 1190  9    and marched till he died. If 500 Japanese were ordered
C03 1200  8    to hold a position, we had to kill 495 before it was
C03 1210  6    ours- and then the last five killed themselves".
C03 1220  1       Brooding about future wars, the Field Marshal has
C03 1220  9    this to say: "The Asian fighting man is at least equally
C03 1230 11    brave [as the white], usually more careless of death,
C03 1240  8    less encumbered by mental doubts, less troubled by
C03 1250  5    humanitarian sentiment, and not so moved by slaughter
C03 1260  2    and mutilation around him. He is, by background and
C03 1260 11    living standards, better fitted to endure hardship
C03 1270  7    uncomplainingly, to demand less in the way of subsistence
C03 1280  7    or comfort, and to look after himself when thrown on
C03 1290  4    his own resources".
C03 1300  1       A bunch of young buckaroos from out West, who go
C03 1300 11    by the name of Texas Boys Choir, loped into Town Hall
C03 1310  9    last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of
C03 1320  6    a sizable audience.
C03 1320  9       Actually, the program they sang was at least two-thirds
C03 1330  9    serious and high-minded, and they sang it beautifully.
C03 1340  6    Under the capable direction of the choir's founder,
C03 1350  2    Geroge Bragg, the twenty-six boys made some lovely
C03 1350 11    sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and baroque
C03 1360  9    madrigals and motets, excerpts from Pergolesi's "Stabat
C03 1370  5    Mater" and all of the Britten "Ceremonial of Carols".
C03 1380  5       Their singing was well-balanced, clear and, within
C03 1390  4    obvious limitations, extremely pleasing. The limitations
C03 1400  2    are those one expects from untrained and unsettled
C03 1400 10    voices- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting
C03 1410  9    intensity, an occasional waver and now and then a bleat.
C03 1420  8       But Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor,
C03 1430  5    and the results he has produced with his boys are generally
C03 1440  5    superior. Most surprising of all, he has accomplished
C03 1450  1    some prodigies in training for the production of words.
C03 1450 10    The Latin, for example, was not only clear; it was
C03 1460  9    even beautiful.
C03 1470  1       Furthermore, there were solid musical virtues in
C03 1470  8    the interpretation of the music. Lines came out neatly
C03 1480  8    and in good balance. Tempos were lively. The piano
C03 1490  4    accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish.
C03 1500  1       A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo
C03 1500 11    motet and a few other passages enchantingly. Other
C03 1510  7    capable soloists included David Clifton, Joseph Schockler
C03 1520  5    and Pat Thompson.
C03 1520  8       The final group included folk songs from back home,
C03 1530  8    stomped out, shouted and chanted with irresistible
C03 1540  4    spirit and in cowboy costume. Boys will be boys, and
C03 1550  3    Texans will be Texans. The combination proved quite
C03 1550 11    irresistible last night. @
C03 1570  1       THE Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze,
C03 1570  9    after the region of Poland, where it has its headquarters,
C03 1580 10    opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last
C03 1590  7    night. A thoroughly ingratiating company it is, and
C03 1600  5    when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize
C03 1610  2    that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your
C03 1610 13    face all evening.
C03 1620  2       Not that it is all funny, by any means, though some
C03 1630  1    of it is definitely so, but simply that the dancers
C03 1630 11    are young and handsome, high-spirited and communicative,
C03 1640  5    and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied.
C03 1650  5    There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance
C03 1660  3    by dance and title by title, for it has a kind of nonstop
C03 1660 16    format, and moves along in an admirable continuity
C03 1670  8    that demands no pauses for identification.
C03 1680  3       The material is all basically of folk origin, gleaned
C03 1690  2    from every section of Poland. But under the direction
C03 1690 11    of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, who with her late husband
C03 1700  9    founded the organization in 1948, it has all been put
C03 1710  9    into theatrical form, treated selectively, choreographed
C03 1720  3    specifically for presentation to spectators, and performed
C03 1730  3    altogether professionally. Under the surface of the
C03 1740  1    wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical
C03 1740 11    ballet training, and an equally professional sense
C03 1750  6    of performing.
C03 1750  8    #@#
C03 1750  9    Since the organization was created thirteen years ago,
C03 1760  8    it is obvious that this is not the original company;
C03 1770  7    it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company.
C03 1780  4    The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully
C03 1790  3    vital and engaging youngsters. The stage is constantly
C03 1800  1    full of them; indeed, there are never fewer than eight
C03 1800 11    of them on stage, and that is only for the more intimate
C03 1810 10    numbers. They can be exuberant or sentimental, flirtatious
C03 1820  4    or funny, but the only thing they seem unable to be
C03 1830  5    is dull.
C03 1830  7       To pick out particular numbers is something of a
C03 1840  4    problem, but one or two identifiable items are too
C03 1840 13    conspicuously excellent to be missed. There is for
C03 1850  8    example, a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first
C03 1860  5    act; the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to
C03 1870  3    music from Moniuszko's opera, "Strasny Dwor', may be
C03 1880  3    the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see;
C03 1880 13    there is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and
C03 1890  9    songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for
C03 1900  6    the men.
C03 1900  8       Everywhere there are little touches of humor, and
C03 1910  6    the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an
C03 1920  3    ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments
C03 1930  1    with winning warmth.
