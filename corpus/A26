A26 0010  1       PROBABLY THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas
A26 0010 10    investment community in years was the Morton Foods
A26 0020  8    stock issue, which was sold to the public during the
A26 0030  7    past week.
A26 0030  9       For many reasons, the demand to buy shares in the
A26 0040  7    Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous. It was
A26 0050  3    not a case of the investment bankers having to sell
A26 0050 13    the stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares
A26 0060 11    to a number of customers and explaining to others why
A26 0070  6    they had no more to sell.
A26 0070 12       Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended
A26 0080  9    up with 25, and customers who had put in a bid to buy
A26 0090  9    400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves
A26 0100  4    lucky to get that many.
A26 0100  9       In fact, very few customers, anywhere in the nation,
A26 0110  7    were able to get more than 100 shares. Some Dallas
A26 0120  4    investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of their
A26 0130  2    customers.
A26 0130  3       A measure of how hot the stock was, can be found
A26 0140  2    in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading
A26 0140 14    began.
A26 0150  1       The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price
A26 0150 11    of $12.50 a share. The first over-the-counter trade
A26 0160  7    Wednesday afternoon at Eppler, Guerin + Turner, the
A26 0170  5    managing underwriter, was at $17 a share. And from
A26 0180  2    that the stock moved right on up until it was trading
A26 0180 13    Thursday morning at around $22 a share.
A26 0190  7       But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it
A26 0200  6    was on the market. Indeed, from the moment the reports
A26 0210  2    of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas
A26 0210 11    last January, the inquiries and demand for the stock
A26 0220  9    started building up.
A26 0230  1       Letters by the reams came in from investment firms
A26 0230 10    all over the nation, all of them wanting to get a part
A26 0240 10    of the shares that would be sold (185,000 to the public
A26 0250  7    at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods
A26 0260  4    employes at $11.50 a share).
A26 0260  9       There was even a cable in French from a bank in
A26 0270  9    Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas
A26 0280  4    stock offering. "We subscribe 500 shares of Morton
A26 0290  1    Foods of Texas. Cable confirmation", it said translated.
A26 0290  9    But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10
A26 0300 11    shares.
A26 0310  1       After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and
A26 0310  9    52 selling group members from coast to coast there
A26 0320  7    were not many shares for anyone.
A26 0330  1       But the result of it all was, E.G.T. partner Dean
A26 0330 11    Guerin believes, an effective distribution of the stock
A26 0340  8    to owners all over the nation.
A26 0350  4       "I feel confident the stock will qualify for the
A26 0360  2    'national list'", he said, meaning its market price
A26 0360 10    would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the
A26 0370  9    country.
A26 0370 10       He was also pleased with the wide distribution because
A26 0380  8    he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas
A26 0390  6    investment men can do just as good a job as the big
A26 0400  5    New York investment bankers claim only they can do.
A26 0400 14       But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such
A26 0405 10    a hot one?
A26 0410  1       The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.
A26 0420  1       First, the general stock market has been boiling
A26 0420  9    upward for the last few months, driving stocks of all
A26 0430  7    kinds up. As a result, it is not easy to find a stock
A26 0440  6    priced as the Morton issue was priced (at roughly 10
A26 0450  2    times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent
A26 0450 13    on the 64c anticipated dividend).
A26 0460  3       Second, the "potato chip industry" has caught the
A26 0470  4    fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods came
A26 0480  2    along there were only two potato chip stocks- Frito
A26 0480 11    and H. W. Lay- on the market.
A26 0490  6       Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price
A26 0500  3    on the market in recent months, both were selling at
A26 0500 13    higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was
A26 0510  9    coming to market at, and everyone who knew anything
A26 0520  7    about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up.
A26 0530  7       And third, the potato chip industry has taken on
A26 0540  3    the flavor of a "growth" industry in the public mind
A26 0540 13    of late. Foods, which long had been considered "recession
A26 0550  9    resistant" but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting
A26 0560  8    like growth stocks, going to higher price-earnings
A26 0570  5    ratios.
A26 0570  6       The potato chip industry these days is growing,
A26 0575  4    not only as a result of population increase and public
A26 0590  1    acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of
A26 0590  9    a combination of circumstances that has led to growth
A26 0600  6    by merger.
A26 0600  8       The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is
A26 0610  6    that many of today's successful companies got started
A26 0620  4    during the deep depression days. Those that remain
A26 0630  1    are those that were headed by strong executives, men
A26 0630 10    with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive
A26 0640  9    survival of the fittest.
A26 0650  1       But today many of those men are reaching retirement
A26 0650 10    age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate
A26 0660  8    tax problem with their closely held companies and also
A26 0670  6    that they have no second-echelon management in their
A26 0680  3    firms.
A26 0680  4       So they go looking for mergers with other firms
A26 0690  2    that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they
A26 0690 11    pound on the doors of firms like Frito.
A26 0700  7       All those things combined to make the Morton Foods
A26 0710  5    stock the hot issue that it was and is.
A26 0720  1       Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known
A26 0720 10    as Chip-o's, turns out to sell as well as its stock
A26 0730 10    did, the stock may turn out to be worth every cent
A26 0740  6    of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to. Dallas
A26 0760  2    and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing
A26 0760 12    and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and
A26 0770  8    supplies, valued in the millions of dollars.
A26 0780  4       More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas
A26 0790  3    and one large manufacturer is located to the north
A26 0790 12    at Sherman.
A26 0800  2       It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's
A26 0810  1    Association is meeting here this week for the 46th
A26 0810 10    time in their 52-year history.
A26 0820  4       The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the
A26 0830  2    State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million
A26 0830 12    dollars. It weighs in the tons, so the proximity of
A26 0840  9    factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an
A26 0850  6    outstanding exhibit each year.
A26 0850 10       A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood
A26 0860  8    of $250,000, and it's a safe assumption that a large
A26 0870  7    percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries
A26 0880  4    contain machinery made in this area.
A26 0890  1       The Murray Co. of Texas, Inc., originated in Dallas
A26 0890 10    in 1896. They've occupied a 22-acre site since the
A26 0900  9    early 1900's. More than 700 employes make gin machinery
A26 0910  6    that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.
A26 0920  1       Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment
A26 0920  9    except for driers and cleaners, and this machinery
A26 0930  8    is purchased from a Dallas-based firm.
A26 0940  2       The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas
A26 0950  2    in 1899. The present company is a combination of several
A26 0950 12    smaller ones that date back to 1834.
A26 0960  7       Headquarters is in Birmingham, Ala. Factories are
A26 0970  4    located here and in Prattville, Ala. About 40 per
A26 0980  3    cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant
A26 0980 13    by more than 200 employes.
A26 0990  5       The company sells a complete line of gin machinery
A26 1000  3    all over the cotton-growing world.
A26 1000  9       Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line
A26 1010  8    of gin machinery and equipment. The firm recently expanded
A26 1020  5    domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result
A26 1030  5    of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co. They export
A26 1040  2    also.
A26 1040  3       The company began operation in 1900 with hardware
A26 1050  1    and oil mill supplies. In 1930, they began making cotton
A26 1050 11    processing equipment. Presently, Hardwicke-Etter employs
A26 1060  6    300-450 people, depending on the season of the year.
A26 1070  7       The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service
A26 1080  7    office in Dallas since 1912. Factory operations are
A26 1090  3    in Columbus, Ga. The district office here employs
A26 1100  1    about 65.
A26 1100  3       The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit
A26 1110  2    System of Ginning have joint headquarters here. The
A26 1110 10    cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and
A26 1120  8    the unit system, which turns out a complete ginning
A26 1130  6    system, began operations in 1959.
A26 1140  1       Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.
A26 1140  7       The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in
A26 1150  8    1928. The firm is prominent in making equipment for
A26 1160  5    cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters, and they
A26 1170  3    lay claim to being the first maker (1910) of boil extraction
A26 1180  1    equipment.
A26 1180  2       The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton
A26 1180  9    makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern
A26 1190  9    gin operation.
A26 1200  1       Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people. They
A26 1200 10    export cotton ginning machinery.
A26 1210  3       The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of "overhead
A26 1220  3    equipment". This includes driers, cleaners, burr extractors,
A26 1230  2    separators and piping that's located above gin stands
A26 1230 10    in a complete gin.
A26 1240  4       The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells
A26 1250  1    equipment in the central cotton belt, including the
A26 1250  9    Mississippi Delta.
A26 1260  2       The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices
A26 1270  1    and factory facilities here. They make gin saws and
A26 1270 10    deal in parts, supplies and some used gin machinery.
A26 1280  6       The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment
A26 1290  4    for sale largely in Texas. They've been in Dallas since
A26 1300  4    1921.
A26 1300  5       Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc. of Dallas makes gin
A26 1310  5    saws and started here 14 years ago. They distribute
A26 1320  1    equipment in 11 states. The firm also handles gin and
A26 1320 11    oil mill supplies such as belting, bearings, etc.
A26 1330  6       Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment
A26 1340  5    of Dallas business economy. New car sales in Dallas
A26 1350  6    County during March showed slight signs of recovering
A26 1360  2    from the doldrums which have characterized sales this
A26 1360 10    year.
A26 1370  1       Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked
A26 1370  9    the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year.
A26 1380 10       Totaling 3,399, sales jumped 14 per cent over February's
A26 1390  8    2,963. However, compared with March 1960 new car sales
A26 1400  7    of 4,441, this March was off 23 per cent.
A26 1410  2       On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter
A26 1410 11    of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind
A26 1420 11    the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744.
A26 1430  6       This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely
A26 1440  3    follows the national trend- estimated sales of domestic
A26 1450  1    cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were
A26 1450 12    about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the
A26 1460 11    first quarter a year earlier.
A26 1470  1       With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that
A26 1470  9    the April-June quarter will equal or top last year.
A26 1480 10    The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging
A26 1490  6    enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules
A26 1500  3    for the next quarter.
A26 1500  7       On the local level, compacts continue to grab a
A26 1510  6    larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced
A26 1520  4    standard models and foreign cars. Only three standard
A26 1530  1    models- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury- had slight year-to-year
A26 1540  1    gains in March sales in the county.
A26 1550  1       The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas
A26 1550  9    County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales
A26 1560  9    Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the
A26 1570  7    Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the
A26 1580  4    club winds up its annual Distributive Education project.
A26 1590  2       Now in its third year, the program is designed to
A26 1600  2    provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers
A26 1600 10    in marketing and salesmanship. Business firms provide
A26 1610  6    20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom
A26 1620  4    instruction in these fields.
A26 1630  1       More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part
A26 1630  9    in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational
A26 1640  7    rather than a need basis.
A26 1650  1       Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T.
A26 1650  8    Owens, national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical
A26 1660  6    Corp. of New York.
A26 1670  1       The 33 honored students are: Mike Trigg, Raymond

A26 1820  1       The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban
A26 1820  8    renewal proposals, particularly their effect on the
A26 1830  7    Federal Housing Administration, came under fire in
A26 1840  5    Dallas last week.
A26 1840  8       The Administration's proposals, complex and sweeping
A26 1850  5    as they are, all deal with fringe areas of the housing
A26 1860  5    market rather than its core, stated Caron S. Stallard,
A26 1870  3    first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association
A26 1880  1    of America.
