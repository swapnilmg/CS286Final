G27 0010  1    In recollection he has said: "Natural or man-made objects
G27 0010 11    kept coming into my head, but I would suppress them
G27 0020  9    sternly". Moreover, he organized the movement of his
G27 0030  7    forms, within his rigorously shaped space, into highly
G27 0040  3    complex equilibriums; and used gradations of color
G27 0050  1    value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors.
G27 0050  9       The worthy Mondrian, seeing these pictures, said
G27 0060  6    in a tone of kindly reproof: "But you are really an
G27 0070  6    artist of the naturalistic tradition"! Helion did not
G27 0080  4    realize it at the time, but it was true.
G27 0090  1       His "monumental" abstraction, made up of smooth,
G27 0090  7    metallic "non-objects" acting upon each other with
G27 0100  6    great tension, won Helion much acclaim during the 'thirties.
G27 0110  5    The play of novel lighting effects also entered into
G27 0120  3    these compositions, whose controlled power and varied
G27 0130  1    activity made them well worth meditating.
G27 0130  7       As Helion's work showed more and more nostalgia
G27 0140  6    for the world of man and nature, the pure abstractionists
G27 0150  2    expressed some disapproval; but Leger, Arp, Lipchitz
G27 0160  1    and Alexander Calder, at the time, gave him their blessing.
G27 0160 11    His canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring
G27 0170  7    them to be "Figures in Space", or "Blue Figure", or
G27 0180  7    "Pink Figure"; and they had (vaguely) heads and feet.
G27 0190  7    Exhibited in shows in London in 1935, and in New York
G27 0200  6    the following year, the new, more elaborated abstracts
G27 0210  2    were much favored in the circles of the modernists
G27 0210 11    as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence.
G27 0220  6    At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked
G27 0230  8    "as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement",
G27 0240  5    according to Herbert Read, "and in the direct line
G27 0250  3    of descent from Cezanne, Seurat, Gris and Leger". In
G27 0260  1    America, Meyer Schapiro observed that, unlike the Mondrian
G27 0260  9    school, Helion "sought a return path to the fullness
G27 0280  9    of nature within the framework of abstract art".
G27 0290  5       It is notable that at this time he was writing with
G27 0300  5    admiration of Cimabue's and Poussin's way of filling
G27 0310  3    space. Abstract art was still the right path for him;
G27 0310 13    but, he held, instead of continuing as an "art of reduction",
G27 0320 10    it must grow, must make a place for the contributions
G27 0330  8    of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of
G27 0340  7    the early cubists and Mondrian.
G27 0340 12       Later Helion wrote of this phase: "For years I built
G27 0350 10    for myself a subtle instrument of relationships- colors
G27 0360  7    and forms without a name. I played on it my secret
G27 0370  7    songs, unexplained, passionate and peaceful".
G27 0380  1       But his own work was evolving further. The extreme
G27 0380 10    limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made
G27 0390  9    that seem to him increasingly arid and cold. He was
G27 0400  6    engaged in constant experiments that searched for new
G27 0410  4    directions. Where would it all lead? He himself did
G27 0420  2    not know, as he said in 1935. But he was "afraid of
G27 0420 14    the future- he would in fact welcome a way back to
G27 0430 12    social integration, a functional art of some kind".
G27 0440  5       During the 1920's the Abstractionists, the German
G27 0450  3    Bauhaus group of industrial designers, and the new
G27 0460  1    architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia,
G27 0460 11    or welfare state, in which their neat and logical constructions
G27 0470  9    might find their proper place. But whereas the postwar
G27 0480  7    American abstractionists seem to Helion to be determined
G27 0490  6    to "escape" from the real world, or simply to rebel
G27 0500  3    against it, the ordered abstractions which he and his
G27 0510  1    associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the
G27 0510  9    hope of "improving" things. "We were possessed by visions
G27 0520  7    of a new civilization to come, very pure and elevated",
G27 0530  7    he has said, "in fact some ideal form of socialism
G27 0540  4    such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918".
G27 0550  1       Instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic
G27 0560  1    depression, the rise of Fascist dictators in Europe,
G27 0560  9    the wasting Civil War in Spain. Very much the political
G27 0570  9    man, Helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly
G27 0580  6    pessimistic atmosphere of France and all Europe, whose
G27 0590  5    foundations seemed to him more and more shaky. In 1936
G27 0600  3    he decided to migrate to America. The Rooseveltian
G27 0600 11    America was a haven of liberalism and progress and
G27 0610  9    seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for
G27 0620  6    civilization. Helion also hoped that America's mastery
G27 0630  3    of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied
G27 0640  2    by the production of new and beautiful art works. "I
G27 0640 12    arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing
G27 0650 10    myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration
G27 0660  8    for new compositions".
G27 0670  1       In New York he was well received by what was then
G27 0670 12    only a small brave band of non-figurative artists,
G27 0680  9    including Alexander Calder, George K. L. Morris, De
G27 0690  6    Kooning, Holty and a few others. After a year in a
G27 0700  6    studio on Sheridan Square, having married an American
G27 0710  2    girl who was a native of Virginia, Helion moved to
G27 0710 12    a village in the Blue Ridge mountains, where he produced
G27 0720  9    some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases.
G27 0730  6       The darkening world scene, at the time of the Munich
G27 0740  7    Pact, continued to trouble his mind even in his remote
G27 0750  3    Virginia studio. "Fear possessed me, and the certainty
G27 0760  1    of war", he has related. "I truly smelled blood, death,
G27 0760 11    heaps of corpses everywhere". In haste he labored to
G27 0770  8    finish some last abstract paintings: a three-panel
G27 0780  5    frieze, with a flying figure and a fallen figure; a
G27 0790  3    "Double-Figure", which went to the Chicago Art Institute,
G27 0800  2    and is considered by him the most successful of his
G27 0800 12    abstracts; and in early 1939, a "Fallen Figure" of
G27 0810  9    very ominous character, which concluded his abstract
G27 0820  5    phase. "I knew I was carrying on with abstraction to
G27 0830  5    its very end- for me", he said of the two years' output
G27 0840  3    in Virginia. With those paintings of big constructions
G27 0850  1    crashing down, he felt he could stop. They were, in
G27 0850 11    effect his last testament to non-objective art.
G27 0860  6       He had taken out first papers for American citizenship;
G27 0870  4    but after war came to Europe, he decided to return
G27 0880  3    to France, arriving there in January, 1940. "I hated
G27 0890  1    the war", he said, "but thought I ought to go because
G27 0890 12    I was, perhaps, one of those who hadn't done enough
G27 0900  8    to prevent it".
G27 0900 11    ##
G27 0910  1    In June, 1940, Sergeant Helion, with a company of reserve
G27 0910 11    troops waiting to go into battle, was sketching the
G27 0920  8    hills south of the Loire River, when the war suddenly
G27 0930  6    rolled in upon him. Its first apparition was a long,
G27 0940  4    gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons, or
G27 0940 13    pushing prams. His company then carried out a confused
G27 0950  9    retreating movement until it was surrounded by the
G27 0960  7    Germans, a few days before France capitulated. After
G27 0970  2    a sort of death march during four days without food,
G27 0980  1    Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car
G27 0980 10    to a labor camp at an estate farm in East Germany.
G27 0990  8    A year later they were removed to a Stalag in the harbor
G27 1000  6    of Stettin. At the time of his capture Helion had on
G27 1010  3    his person a sketchbook he had bought at Woolworth's
G27 1010 12    in New York. When he was stripped, deloused and numbered
G27 1020 10    by his guards, his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized
G27 1030  7    and thrown on a pile of prisoners' goods to be confiscated.
G27 1040  5    "It was then I knew that they were making war against
G27 1050  4    Man, the individual within!- who questioned things
G27 1060  2    when given orders".
G27 1060  5       At Stettin the university-educated artist, who had
G27 1070  4    studied German, was chosen to serve as interpreter
G27 1080  1    and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander. In
G27 1080 11    secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners'
G27 1090  8    Central Committee, which plotted sabotage, planned
G27 1100  3    a few escapes, and maintained a hidden control over
G27 1110  1    the wretched French slave-laborers.
G27 1110  6       In the Stalag, Helion came to know and love his
G27 1120  7    comrades, most of them plain folk, who, in their extremity,
G27 1130  3    showed true courage and ran great risks to help each
G27 1140  1    other. How much they esteemed him is shown by the fact
G27 1140 12    that their underground committee selected him as one
G27 1150  6    of the few who would be helped to escape. In the prison
G27 1160  6    camp's Black Market civilian clothes were quietly bought
G27 1170  3    and forged papers were devised for him; during long
G27 1180  1    weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed.
G27 1180  9       Every morning contingents of prisoners would be
G27 1190  6    sent out to labor in nearby factories. One evening,
G27 1200  3    while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard
G27 1210  1    among the prisoners remaining there, a simulated melee
G27 1210  9    was staged- just as the gates were opened to admit
G27 1220  9    other prisoners returning from work. As Helion wrote
G27 1230  5    afterward: "
G27 1230  6       Their sentry followed ... Four hands were stretched
G27 1240  6    toward me by my comrades behind me. Marquet held my
G27 1250  3    briefcase; Finot held a wallet with my money and papers;
G27 1260  1    Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers ...
G27 1260 10    They felt rough and kind and warm. At this moment the
G27 1270 10    volley-ball hit the ground. Duclos ran toward Desprez
G27 1280  5    with fists raised. The guards all rushed up to intervene
G27 1290  5    ..."
G27 1290  6       Shedding his prison cloak, Helion shot through the
G27 1300  4    gates, now clad in civilian garments and with the passport
G27 1310  2    of a Flemish worker. Riding trains, hitching hikes
G27 1310 10    on trucks across Germany, slipping through guarded
G27 1320  6    frontiers with the help of secret guides, he eventually
G27 1330  5    reached Vichy France, and, by the winter of 1943, was
G27 1340  4    back in Virginia. He wrote: "
G27 1340  9       To escape from a prison camp required a very special
G27 1350  8    state of mind; not only loathing of captivity, but
G27 1360  4    a faith, a hope that is even stronger. I left behind
G27 1370  2    me brave men, whom captivity had robbed of all hope.
G27 1370 12    They too loved their families, longed for their villages:
G27 1380  8    yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare ... the
G27 1390  8    fearful chance of escape".
G27 1400  1       It was a time of revelations for him. Even the most
G27 1400 11    rational of men, under great stress, may be transported
G27 1410  7    by a new faith and behave like mystics. Helion knew
G27 1420  4    that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice
G27 1430  1    of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando XIII, Stettin,
G27 1430  9    as to his own fierce will and love of life. After that,
G27 1440  8    he declared, "to return to freedom was to fall to one's
G27 1450  7    knees before the real world and adore it". In prison
G27 1460  4    he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from
G27 1470  1    life, his guards, his companions in misery. Now all
G27 1470 10    his desires centered on "rediscovering and singing
G27 1480  5    of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects
G27 1490  6    so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence". And,
G27 1500  2    he added: "During the many months in prison camp, all
G27 1510  1    abstract images vanished from my mind".
G27 1510  7       Before leaving for America, he happened to see his
G27 1520  6    old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions.
G27 1530  5    Arp protested: "But it is impossible! Everything in
G27 1540  3    the way of representation has already been done by
G27 1540 12    the old masters". Helion, however, clung to the belief
G27 1550  9    that "in escaping from the Stalag I had also escaped
G27 1560  8    from Abstraction".
G27 1570  1       While convalescing in his Virginia home he wrote
G27 1570  9    a book recording his prison experiences and escape,
G27 1580  6    entitled: They Shall Not Have Me ... Published originally
G27 1590  5    in (Helion's) English by Dutton + Co. of New York,
G27 1600  6    in 1943, the book was received by the press as a work
G27 1610  4    of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic
G27 1620  1    accounts of World War II from the French side. It
G27 1620 11    was very widely read, too; and the author, who seemed
G27 1630  8    the embodiment of France's rising spirit of resistance
G27 1640  5    to her conquerors, was much complimented for his daring
G27 1650  4    military action. But when he showed his new figurative
G27 1660  1    pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp,
G27 1660 10    they paid him no compliments and drew long faces.
G27 1670  7       Between 1944 and 1947 Helion had a series of one-man
G27 1680  7    shows- at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery in New York and
G27 1690  5    in Paris- of his new realistic pictures. They reincarnated
G27 1700  1    the figures of human beings banished from his canvases
G27 1700 10    since the 1920's. These new pictures focussed on the
G27 1710  9    familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard
G27 1720  6    the men in his prison camp talking about as the things
G27 1730  5    they missed most, hence associated with the sense of
G27 1740  2    lost freedom: the cafe at the corner, the newspaper
G27 1740 11    kiosk, the girls in doorways and windows along the
G27 1750  7    street, the golden-crusted French bread they lacked,
G27 1760  4    the cigarettes denied them. One of the pictures was
G27 1770  2    of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously
G27 1770 12    lighting a cigarette; others were of men doffing their
G27 1780  7    hats to each other, carrying umbrellas with pomp, reading
G27 1790  5    newspapers, or simply showing loaves of bread spread
G27 1800  3    out.
