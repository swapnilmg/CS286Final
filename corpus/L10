L10 0010  1       "Not since last night. I didn't think there was
L10 0010 10    any reason to".
L10 0020  2       "Maybe there isn't. Speak to him again anyway. Try
L10 0030  1    talking to some of the fellows he works with, friends,
L10 0030 11    anyone. Try to find out how happy he is with his wife,
L10 0040 11    whether he plays around with women. You might try looking
L10 0050  6    into his wife too. She might have been talking to some
L10 0060  4    of her friends about her husband if they've been having
L10 0070  2    any trouble".
L10 0070  4       "You think Black's the one we're looking for"?
L10 0080  3       "Yeah. I think he might be", Conrad said grimly.
L10 0090  3    "Then again he might not".
L10 0090  8       "What a stinking world", Rourke said. "Black is
L10 0100  6    Gilborn's best friend".
L10 0110  1       "I know".
L10 0110  3       "Will you be coming back soon"?
L10 0120  1       "I think so. I'm on my way to see the Jacobs woman".
L10 0130  1       "Gilborn's secretary? What for? You don't think
L10 0130  8    Gilborn is the-"?
L10 0150  3       "I don't think anything. I just don't want to go
L10 0160  4    off half-cocked before picking up Black, that's all".
L10 0170  1    Conrad interrupted. "Gilborn says he was in his office
L10 0170 10    all day with her yesterday. I'd like to make sure.
L10 0180  8    Also, it's just possible she might know something about
L10 0190  6    Mrs. Gilborn".
L10 0190  8       "Right. I'll see you later".
L10 0200  5       "Aren't you ever going to go home"?
L10 0210  1       "It sure as hell doesn't look like it, does it?
L10 0220  1    I'm telling you, if these corpses ever knew the trouble
L10 0220 11    they put us to, they'd think twice before letting themselves
L10 0230  8    get knocked off".
L10 0240  1       "Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet".
L10 0240 11       Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth
L10 0250 11    bench, massaging his right leg.
L10 0260  4       He looked at his watch. It was ten minutes before
L10 0270  2    eleven.
L10 0270  3       He wondered how long it would be before they had
L10 0280  2    a signed confession from Lionel Black.
L10 0280  8       Thirty years' experience let him know, even at this
L10 0290  7    early stage, that Black was his man.
L10 0300  2       But he still wanted to know why.
L10 0300  9    ##
L10 0300 10    It was a cold, windy day, the day after Kitti's death,
L10 0310  7    but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery
L10 0320  5    October wind.
L10 0320  7       After leaving Conrad, Gilborn had no destination.
L10 0330  5    He simply walked, not noticing where he was, not caring.
L10 0340  5    He stopped automatically at the street corners, waiting
L10 0350  2    for the traffic lights to change, unheeding of other
L10 0350 11    people, his coat open and flapping.
L10 0360  5       As he walked, he tried to think.
L10 0370  1       Of Kitti. Of himself. Mainly of what Conrad had
L10 0370 10    tried to make him believe.
L10 0380  3       There was nothing coherent about his thinking. It
L10 0390  2    was a succession of picture-images passing through
L10 0390 10    his mind: the same ones, different ones, in no apparent
L10 0400  8    sequence, in no logical succession.
L10 0410  1       The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it
L10 0410 11    impossible for Gilborn to accept, with any degree of
L10 0420  9    realism, the actuality of it.
L10 0430  3       Conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him
L10 0430 10    only. Emotionally, they penetrated him not at all.
L10 0440  8       Whoever he was and your wife were intimate.
L10 0450  7       Gilborn remembered Conrad's exact words. They made
L10 0460  5    sense and yet they didn't. He knew Conrad had told
L10 0470  3    him the truth. It was so. Yet it wasn't so. It wasn't
L10 0480  1    so because it couldn't be so.
L10 0480  7       When Kitti was alive- and he remembered the pressure
L10 0490  6    of her hand resting lightly on his arm- she had been
L10 0500  6    the center of his life.
L10 0500 11       She was the sun, he the closest planet orbiting
L10 0510  4    around her, the rest of the world existing and visible
L10 0520  3    yet removed.
L10 0520  5       For fifty-five years he had lived, progressing towards
L10 0530  2    a no-goal, eating, working, breathing without plan,
L10 0540  1    without reason.
L10 0540  3       Kitti had come along to justify everything. She
L10 0550  1    was his goal, she was his reason. He had lived all
L10 0550 12    his life waiting for her.
L10 0560  3       Not once, in the time that he had known her, had
L10 0560 14    he ever considered the possibility, not once, not for
L10 0570  9    one one-thousandth of a second, of her infidelity.
L10 0580  7       He could not consider it now. Not really. And so
L10 0590  5    he walked, aimless again.
L10 0590  9       The walk ended, inevitably, right in front of his
L10 0600  7    hotel building. The doorman began to nod his head automatically,
L10 0610  6    then remembered who Gilborn was, what had happened
L10 0620  3    to him the night before. He looked at Gilborn with
L10 0620 13    undisguised curiosity.
L10 0630  2       Gilborn passed by him without seeing him.
L10 0640  1       He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator
L10 0640 11    lost in his own thoughts.
L10 0650  2       In the apartment itself, all was still. The police
L10 0660  1    were no longer there. There was no evidence that anything
L10 0660 11    was different than it had been.
L10 0670  5       Except that Kitti wasn't there.
L10 0680  1       Without taking off his coat, he sat in the blue
L10 0680 11    chair which still faced the closed bedroom door.
L10 0690  6       At last, sitting there, in the familiar surroundings,
L10 0700  3    the truth began to sink in.
L10 0700  9       Who?
L10 0710  1       He felt no anger towards Kitti, no sense that she
L10 0710 11    had betrayed him.
L10 0720  2       Who?
L10 0720  3       She was all he had, everything he had, everything
L10 0730  2    he wanted. Someone had taken her away from him.
L10 0740  1       Who?
L10 0740  2       Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger,
L10 0740 12    there is a right-hand one, he remembered from his school
L10 0750 11    days.
L10 0760  1       Where there is a victim, there is a killer.
L10 0760  9       Who?
L10 0770  1       Whoever he was and your wife were intimate.
L10 0770  9       He rose from the chair, took off his coat. Quickly,
L10 0790  7    he went into the bedroom.
L10 0800  1       The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain.
L10 0800 11    Gilborn stood there for a long time. He looked at the
L10 0810 10    bed unblinkingly.
L10 0810 12       The bed was empty now. Kitti would lie in it no
L10 0820 11    more. He would lie in it no more.
L10 0830  4       Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that
L10 0840  1    same bed with ... Who?
L10 0840  6       For thirty minutes, Stanley Gilborn stood there.
L10 0850  3       At the end of the half-hour, racking his brains,
L10 0860  1    thinking over and over again of Kitti, her friends,
L10 0860 10    her past, he left the bedroom.
L10 0870  4       Who?
L10 0870  5       He could think of no answer.
L10 0890  1       Gilborn put on his coat again. Before leaving, he
L10 0890 10    took one last, lingering look at the apartment.
L10 0900  7       He knew he would never see it again.
L10 0910  4       In the street, walking as quickly as he could, Stanley
L10 0920  1    Gilborn was a lone figure.
L10 0920  6    ##
L10 0920  7    On Blanche Jacobs, Kitti Gilborn's death had a quite
L10 0930  6    different effect. For Blanche, Kitti's death was a
L10 0940  4    source of guilty, but nonetheless soaring, happy hope.
L10 0950  1       In Blanche's defense, it must be said she was unaware
L10 0950 11    of the newborn hope.
L10 0960  4       If anyone had asked her, she would have described
L10 0970  1    herself only as nervous and worried. The figures on
L10 0970 10    the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and
L10 0980  9    waving around so badly it was all she could do to make
L10 0990  8    them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter.
L10 1000  3       She wondered whether Stanley would call. She wanted
L10 1010  2    to be with him, to give him the comfort and companionship
L10 1010 13    she knew he needed.
L10 1020  4       She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that
L10 1030  1    he might call while she was out. He hadn't. And now
L10 1030 12    she was feeling sick, both from concern about Stanley
L10 1040  7    and hunger.
L10 1040  9       Why hadn't he called?
L10 1050  3       Men, she reflected, even men like Stanley, are unpredictable.
L10 1060  3       She tried to think of his unpredictable actions
L10 1070  2    in the eleven years she had known him and discovered
L10 1070 12    they weren't so many after all.
L10 1080  5       Stanley really was quite predictable. That was one
L10 1090  4    of the things she liked about Stanley. He wasn't like
L10 1100  1    so many other men. The dentist last night, for instance.
L10 1100 11    Dinner and the movies had been fine. He had taken her
L10 1110 10    upstairs to say good night. She had invited him in
L10 1120  6    for coffee.
L10 1120  8       It was in the kitchen, as she was watching the kettle,
L10 1130  7    waiting for the water to boil, that he had grabbed
L10 1140  4    for her. Without warning, without giving her a chance
L10 1150  1    to prepare for it. From behind, he had put his arms
L10 1150 12    on her shoulders, turned her around, and pressed her
L10 1160  7    to him, so close she couldn't breathe.
L10 1170  1       Later, she apologized for the long scratch across
L10 1170  9    his face, tried to explain she couldn't help herself,
L10 1180  8    that the panic arose in her unwanted. But he hadn't
L10 1190  7    understood. When he left, she knew she would never
L10 1200  4    see him again.
L10 1200  7       Stanley wasn't like that. She could always predict
L10 1210  4    what Stanley was going to do, ever since she first
L10 1220  2    met him.
L10 1220  4       Except for that one morning. The morning he walked
L10 1230  1    in to announce to her, blushing, that he was married.
L10 1230 11    She thought she was going to die.
L10 1240  6       She had assumed before then that one day he would
L10 1250  4    ask her to marry him.
L10 1250  9       Blanche couldn't remember when she had first arrived
L10 1260  6    at this conclusion. She thought it was sometime during
L10 1270  3    the second week she worked for Stanley. It was nothing
L10 1280  1    that he said or did, but it seemed so natural to her
L10 1280 13    that she should be working for him, looking forward
L10 1290  8    to his eventual proposal.
L10 1300  1       She was thirty-one years old then. Her mother was
L10 1300 11    already considerably concerned over her daughter's
L10 1310  5    future. But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene
L10 1320  6    and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's
L10 1330  2    continued carping, had been able to resist her urgings
L10 1340  1    to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility
L10 1340  9    of matrimony.
L10 1350  1       For Blanche, it was only a matter of time before
L10 1350 11    Stanley would propose. It was to be expected that Stanley
L10 1360  9    would be shy, slow in taking such a momentous step.
L10 1370  6    Stanley went along in life, she knew, convinced that
L10 1380  3    he deserved the love and faith of no woman. As a result,
L10 1390  1    he never looked for it.
L10 1390  6       But one day, she expected, he would somehow discover,
L10 1400  3    without her having to tell him, that there was such
L10 1410  1    a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give
L10 1410 13    him love, faith, and anything else a woman could give
L10 1420  8    a husband. Indeed, there was a woman who, unasked,
L10 1430  5    had already given him love. Unquestionably, Blanche
L10 1440  1    loved Stanley.
L10 1440  3       And then, unexpectedly, Stanley made his announcement.
L10 1450  2       On that first day, Blanche literally thought she
L10 1460  2    was going to die, or, at the very least, go out of
L10 1460 14    her mind.
L10 1470  1       It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker
L10 1470 11    hadn't been everything that Blanche was not.
L10 1480  6       Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley, taller
L10 1490  4    than Stanley, prettier than Stanley had any right to
L10 1500  3    hope for, much less expect. Kitti could have married
L10 1500 12    a score of men. There was no reason for her to marry
L10 1510 11    someone like Stanley Gilborn, there was no need for
L10 1520  7    her to marry Stanley.
L10 1520 11       Kitti had come into the office, on somebody's recommendation,
L10 1530  9    because she needed help in preparing her income tax
L10 1540  8    return.
L10 1540  9       Stanley had filled out the return and because, when
L10 1550  8    he was finished, it was close to the lunch hour, he
L10 1560  6    had politely asked Kitti to join him, never expecting
L10 1570  1    her to accept.
L10 1570  4       Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley's
L10 1580  3    office was open and, without straining too hard, she
L10 1580 12    could hear everything that was said.
L10 1590  6       Stanley had gone out, saying he would be back in
L10 1600  6    an hour. He hadn't come back for over two.
L10 1610  1       After that day, Blanche still didn't know exactly
L10 1610  9    what had happened. There were mornings when Stanley
L10 1620  6    came in late, afternoons when he left early, days when
L10 1640  6    he didn't come in at all.
L10 1640 12       Blanche knew something must be causing Stanley's
L10 1650  7    new, strange behavior but she never once connected
L10 1660  5    it with Kitti Walker. It was too unprecedented. Then,
L10 1670  2    six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office,
L10 1680  1    Stanley announced he and Kitti were married.
L10 1680  8       Somehow, Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise
L10 1690  7    and offer her congratulations.
L10 1700  1       That night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon
L10 1710  1    in Acapulco.
L10 1710  3       While they were away Blanche came into the office
L10 1730  1    every morning, running things as she had always run
L10 1730 10    them for Stanley, going through the week in a dazed
L10 1740  8    stupor, getting things done automatically, out of habit.
L10 1750  4       For exactly one week, she was able to continue in
L10 1760  3    this manner.
L10 1760  5       On the morning of Stanley's return, however, her
L10 1770  3    strength left her. Two hours of watching his serenely
L10 1780  1    happy face, listening to his soft humming as he bent
L10 1780 11    over his penciled figures, and Blanche had to leave.
L10 1790  7       She stayed away for ten days. Those ten days were
L10 1800  6    like no others that Blanche had known.
L10 1810  1       Mostly, she stayed in bed. She didn't tell anyone,
L10 1810 10    even her mother, what was wrong. She refused to have
L10 1820  9    a doctor, insisting there was nothing a doctor could
L10 1830  6    do for her.
