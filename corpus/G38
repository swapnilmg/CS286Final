G38 0010  1    She describes, first, the imaginary reaction of a foreigner
G38 0010 10    puzzled by this "unseasonable exultation"; he is answered
G38 0020  7    by a confused, honest Englishman. The reasons for the
G38 0030  7    Whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation
G38 0040  6    of regaining control of the government, their delight
G38 0050  3    at the prospect of a new war, their hopes of having
G38 0050 14    the Tories hanged, and so on. As for the author of
G38 0060 11    the Englishman, Mrs. Manley sarcastically deplores
G38 0070  5    that the sole defense of the Protestant cause should
G38 0080  4    be left to "Ridpath, Dick Steele, and their Associates,
G38 0090  3    with the Apostles of Young Man's Coffee-House".
G38 0100  1       Another controversy typical of the war between the
G38 0110  1    Englishman and the Examiner centered on Robert (later
G38 0110  9    Viscount) Molesworth, a Whig leader in Ireland and
G38 0120  8    a member of the Irish Privy Council. On December 21,
G38 0130  6    the day that the Irish House of Commons petitioned
G38 0140  4    for removal of Sir Constantine Phipps, their Tory Lord
G38 0150  3    Chancellor, Molesworth reportedly made this remark
G38 0150  9    on the defense of Phipps by Convocation: "They that
G38 0160  8    have turned the world upside down, are come hither
G38 0170  7    also". Upon complaints from the Lower House of Convocation
G38 0180  5    to the House of Lords, he was removed from the Privy
G38 0190  4    Council, his remark having been represented as a blasphemous
G38 0200  1    affront to the clergy. Steele, who had earlier praised
G38 0200 10    Molesworth in Tatler No. 189, now defended him in Englishman
G38 0220  1    No. 46, depicting his removal as a setback to the Constitution.
G38 0220 12    On the other hand, Molesworth was naturally assailed
G38 0230  8    in the Tory press. Swift, in the Dublin edition of
G38 0240  7    A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's Introduction, indicated
G38 0250  3    his feelings by including Molesworth, along with Toland,
G38 0260  4    Tindal, and Collins, in the group of those who, like
G38 0270  3    Burnet, are engaged in attacking all Convocations of
G38 0270 11    the clergy. In the same way he coupled Molesworth and
G38 0280  9    Wharton in a letter to Archbishop King, and he had
G38 0290  7    earlier described him as "the worst of them" in some
G38 0300  5    "Observations" on the Irish Privy Council submitted
G38 0310  2    to Oxford. A month later, in The Publick Spirit of
G38 0320  1    the Whigs, he used Steele's defense of Molesworth as
G38 0320 10    evidence of his disrespect for the clergy, calling
G38 0330  7    Steele's position an affront to the "whole Convocation
G38 0340  5    of Ireland". On this issue, then, as on so many in
G38 0350  6    these months, Steele and Swift took rigidly opposed
G38 0360  1    points of view.
G38 0360  4       In the early months of 1714, the battle between
G38 0370  2    Swift and Steele over the issue of the Succession entered
G38 0370 12    its major phase. The preliminaries ended with the publication
G38 0380  9    of Steele's Crisis on January 19, and from that point
G38 0390  9    on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace. In answer to
G38 0400  8    The Crisis, Swift produced The Publick Spirit of the
G38 0410  6    Whigs, his most extensive and bitter attack on his
G38 0420  4    old friend. By this time, as we shall see, the Tories
G38 0430  1    were already planning to "punish" Steele for his political
G38 0430 10    writing by expelling him from the House of Commons.
G38 0440  9    Despite his defense of himself in the final paper of
G38 0450  8    the Englishman and in his speech before the House,
G38 0460  4    their efforts were successful. Steele lost his seat
G38 0470  2    in Parliament, and his personal quarrel with Swift,
G38 0470 10    by now a public issue, thus reached its climax.
G38 0480  6       Of all the Whig tracts written in support of the
G38 0490  6    Succession, The Crisis is perhaps the most significant.
G38 0500  3    Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate.
G38 0510  1    Hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation,
G38 0510  7    said to have reached 40,000, and if one may judge by
G38 0520  8    the reaction of Swift and other government writers,
G38 0530  3    the work must have had considerable impact. Steele's
G38 0540  1    main business here is to arouse public opinion to the
G38 0540 11    immediate danger of a Stuart Restoration. To this end,
G38 0550  9    the first and longest section of the tract cites all
G38 0560  7    the laws enacted since the Revolution to defend England
G38 0570  4    against the "Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince". In
G38 0580  2    his comment on these laws Steele sounds all the usual
G38 0580 12    notes of current Whig propaganda, ranging from a criticism
G38 0590  9    of the Tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of
G38 0600  9    Marlborough; but his principal theme is that the intrigues
G38 0610  6    of the Tories, "our Popish or Jacobite Party", pose
G38 0620  3    an immediate threat to Church and State. Like Burnet,
G38 0630  2    he deplores the indifference of the people in the face
G38 0630 12    of the crisis. Treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian
G38 0640  8    Succession, he complains, are allowed to pass unnoticed.
G38 0650  8    In this connection, Swift, too, is drawn in for attack:
G38 0660  7    "The Author of the Conduct of the Allies has dared
G38 0670  5    to drop Insinuations about altering the Succession".
G38 0680  1    In his effort to stir the public from its lethargy,
G38 0680 11    Steele goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of
G38 0690 10    the sort to be expected in the event of a Stuart Restoration,
G38 0700  8    and, with rousing rhetoric, he asserts that the only
G38 0710  5    preservation from these "Terrours" is to be found in
G38 0720  3    the laws he has so tediously cited. "It is no time",
G38 0720 14    he writes, "to talk with Hints and Innuendos, but openly
G38 0730 10    and honestly to profess our Sentiments before our Enemies
G38 0740  8    have compleated and put their Designs in Execution
G38 0750  5    against us".
G38 0750  7       Steele apparently professed his sentiments in this
G38 0760  6    book too openly and honestly for his own good, since
G38 0770  4    the government was soon to use it as evidence against
G38 0780  1    him in his trial before the House. In the final issues
G38 0780 12    of the Englishman, which ended just as the new session
G38 0790  8    of Parliament began, he provided his enemies with still
G38 0800  7    more ammunition. For example, No. 56 printed the patent
G38 0810  5    giving the Electoral Prince the title of Duke of Cambridge.
G38 0820  3    In a few months the Duke was to be the center of a
G38 0830  2    controversy of some significance on the touchy question
G38 0830 10    of the Protestant Succession. At the order of the Dowager
G38 0840  8    Electress, the Hanoverian agents, supported by the
G38 0850  5    Whig leaders, demanded that a writ of summons be issued
G38 0860  5    which would call the Duke to England to sit in Parliament,
G38 0870  2    thus further insuring the Succession by establishing
G38 0870  9    a Hanoverian Prince in England before the Queen's death.
G38 0880  8    Anne was furious, and Bolingbroke advised that the
G38 0890  7    request be refused. Oxford, realizing that the law
G38 0900  5    required the issuance of the writ, took the opposite
G38 0910  1    view, for which the Queen never forgave him. Accordingly
G38 0910 10    the request was granted, but the Elector himself, who
G38 0920  9    had not been consulted by his mother, rejected the
G38 0930  6    proposal and recalled his agent Schu^tz, whose impolitic
G38 0940  3    handling of the affair had caused the Hanoverian interest
G38 0950  2    to suffer and had made Oxford's dismissal more likely
G38 0960  1    than ever. Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy
G38 0960 11    for such a plan. A few days after this Englishman appeared,
G38 0970  9    Defoe reported to Oxford that Steele was expected to
G38 0980  8    move in Parliament that the Duke be called over; Defoe
G38 0990  6    then commented, "If they Could Draw that young Gentleman
G38 1000  4    into Their Measures They would show themselves quickly,
G38 1010  2    for they are not asham'd to Say They want Onely a head
G38 1020  1    to Make a beginning".
G38 1020  5       The final issue of the Englishman, No. 57 for February
G38 1030  5    15, ran to some length and was printed as a separate
G38 1040  4    pamphlet, entitled The Englishman: Being the Close
G38 1050  1    of the Paper So-called. Steele's purpose is to present
G38 1050 11    a general defense of his political writing and a resume
G38 1060  9    of the themes which had occupied him in the Englishman;
G38 1070  7    but there is much here also which bears directly on
G38 1080  5    his personal quarrel with Swift. Thus he complains,
G38 1090  1    with considerable justice, that the Tory writers have
G38 1090  9    resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments.
G38 1100  8    His birth, education, and fortune, he says, have all
G38 1110  7    been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the
G38 1120  4    freedom of an Englishman, and he assures the reader
G38 1120 13    that "whoever talks with me, is speaking to a Gentleman
G38 1130 10    born". As notable examples of this abuse, he quotes
G38 1140  8    passages from the Examiner, "that Destroyer of all
G38 1150  5    things", and The Character of Richard Steele, which
G38 1160  3    he here attributes to Swift. Though put in rather maudlin
G38 1170  2    terms, Steele's defense of himself has a reasonable
G38 1170 10    basis. His point is simply that the Tories have showered
G38 1180 10    him with personal satire, despite the fact that as
G38 1190  7    a private subject he has a right to speak on political
G38 1200  5    matters without affronting the prerogative of the Sovereign.
G38 1210  3    He claims, too, that his political convictions are
G38 1210 11    simply those which are called "Revolution Principles"
G38 1220  7    and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties.
G38 1230  8       The final section of this pamphlet is of special
G38 1240  7    interest in a consideration of Steele's relations with
G38 1250  3    Swift. It purports to be a letter from Steele to a
G38 1260  2    friend at court, who, in Miss Blanchard's opinion,
G38 1260 10    could only be meant as Swift. Steele first answers
G38 1270  7    briefly the charges which his "dear old Friend" has
G38 1280  5    made about his pamphlet on Dunkirk and his Crisis.
G38 1300  2    Then he launches into an attack on the Tory ministers,
G38 1310  1    whom he calls the "New Converts"; by this term he means
G38 1310 12    to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest
G38 1320  8    of the Church despite their own education and manner
G38 1330  6    of life- a gibe, in other words, at the "Presbyterianism"
G38 1340  4    in Harley's family and at Bolingbroke's reputed impiety.
G38 1350  3    The Tory leaders, he insinuates, are cynically using
G38 1360  2    the Church as a political "By-word" to increase party
G38 1360 12    friction and keep themselves in power. This is the
G38 1370  9    principal point made in this final section of Englishman
G38 1380  7    No. 57, and it caps Steele's efforts in his other writing
G38 1390  6    of these months to counteract the notion of the Tories
G38 1400  5    as a "Church Party" supported by the body of the clergy.
G38 1410  4       Next, Steele turns his attention to the "Courtier"
G38 1420  1    he is addressing. He explains that there are sometimes
G38 1420 10    honorable courtiers, but that too often a man who succeeds
G38 1430 10    at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his Sovereign
G38 1440  6    and nation to his own avarice and ambition. Such, he
G38 1450  5    implies, is the case with his friend, who is not really
G38 1460  2    a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts.
G38 1470  1    If "Jack the Courtier" is really to be taken as Swift,
G38 1470 12    the following remark is obviously Steele's comment
G38 1480  6    on Swift's change of parties and its effect on their
G38 1490  7    friendship: "I assure you, dear Jack, when I first
G38 1500  5    found out such an Allay in you, as makes you of so
G38 1510  3    malleable a Constitution, that you may be worked into
G38 1510 12    any Form an Artificer pleases, I foresaw I should not
G38 1520  9    enjoy your Favour much longer". He closes his "letter"
G38 1530  6    by demanding that Dunkirk be demolished, that the Pretender
G38 1540  6    be forced to move farther away from the coast of England,
G38 1550  5    and that the Queen and the House of Hanover come to
G38 1560  3    a better understanding. The last point was soon to
G38 1560 12    be included in the "seditious" remarks used against
G38 1570  7    him in Parliament.
G38 1580  1       The Examiner, during Steele's trial a month later,
G38 1580  9    printed an answer from the "courtier" addressed to
G38 1590  8    "R. S." at Button's coffee-house. He reviews Steele's
G38 1600  7    entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties
G38 1610  7    are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities
G38 1620  5    and talents achievements which more properly should
G38 1630  2    be credited to the indulgence of his friends. Once
G38 1630 11    more, in other words, Steele is said to be indebted
G38 1640 10    to Swift for his "wit"; this was the form in which
G38 1650  7    their private feud most often appeared in the Tory
G38 1660  4    press, especially the Examiner. In The Publick Spirit
G38 1670  2    of the Whigs, it may be noted, Swift himself contemptuously
G38 1680  1    dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court:
G38 1680  9    "I suppose by the Style of old Friend, and the like,
G38 1690 11    it must be some Body there of his own Level; among
G38 1700  8    whom, his Party have indeed more Friends than I could
G38 1710  6    wish".
G38 1710  7       On February 16, Steele took his seat in Parliament.
G38 1720  7    By now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from
G38 1730  5    Tory papers and pamphlets, and action was being taken
G38 1740  2    to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament.
G38 1740 10    On the very day that the parliamentary session began,
G38 1750  8    another "Infamous Libel" appeared, entitled A Letter
G38 1760  6    from the Facetious Dr. Andrew Tripe, at Bath, to the
G38 1770  7    Venerable Nestor Ironside. It is filled with the usual
G38 1780  5    personal abuse of Steele, especially of his physical
G38 1790  1    appearance; in the opening paragraph, too, Steele is
G38 1790  9    accused of extreme egotism, of giving "himself the
G38 1800  8    preference to all the learned, his contemporaries,
G38 1810  3    from Dr. Sw-ft himself, even down to Poet Cr-spe of
G38 1820  4    the Customhouse".
