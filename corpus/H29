H29 0010  1       In recent months, much attention has been given
H29 0010  9    to the probable extent of the current downtrend in
H29 0020  7    business and economists are somewhat divided as to
H29 0030  4    the outlook for the near future. And yet, despite some
H29 0040  1    disappointment with the performance of this first year
H29 0040  9    of the new decade, 1960 has been a good year in many
H29 0050 10    ways, with many overall measures of business having
H29 0060  4    reached new peaks for the year as a whole. The shift
H29 0070  2    in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year
H29 0070 11    to the present mood of caution has probably been a
H29 0080  9    good thing, in that it has prevented the accumulation
H29 0090  4    of the burdensome inventories that have characterized
H29 0100  1    many previous swings in the business cycle. This caution
H29 0110  1    has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers
H29 0110 10    and distributors to shift the inventory burden back
H29 0120  7    on the supplier, and the fact stocks at retail are
H29 0130  5    low in many lines has escaped attention because of
H29 0140  2    the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing
H29 0140 10    level.
H29 0150  1       In the electronics industry, this tendency is well
H29 0150  8    illustrated by inventories of TV sets. Factory stocks
H29 0160  6    in recent months have been the highest they have been
H29 0170  5    in three years, while those at retail are below 1959.
H29 0180  2    The total value of our industry's shipments, at factory
H29 0180 11    prices, increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately
H29 0190  9    $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the
H29 0200 10    major segments of our business- home entertainment,
H29 0210  5    military, industrial, and replacement. I believe a
H29 0220  2    further gain is in prospect for 1961.
H29 0220  9    #HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES UP#
H29 0230  2    Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets
H29 0230 10    such as consoles and combinations since 1953, dollar
H29 0240  7    value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was
H29 0250  5    about $1.9 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 1959.
H29 0260  3    Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months
H29 0270  1    of 1959 through July; set production (excluding those
H29 0270  9    destined for the export market) also ran ahead in the
H29 0280  9    early months, but was curtailed after the usual vacation
H29 0290  5    shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some
H29 0300  3    of the early production plans had been overly optimistic.
H29 0310  1    For the year as a whole, retail sales of TV sets probably
H29 0310 13    came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959; however,
H29 0320 10    production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2
H29 0330  8    million.
H29 0330  9       In contrast to the lower turnout of TV, total radio
H29 0340  7    production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7
H29 0350  5    million (excluding export). Both home and auto radios
H29 0360  2    were in excellent demand, with retail sales of home
H29 0360 11    sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven;
H29 0370 10    sales and production of home sets were about equal
H29 0380  6    at 10.4 million units. Auto set production came to
H29 0390  3    about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959.
H29 0390 12    Separate phonographs also had a good year, reflecting
H29 0400  8    the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same
H29 0410  5    tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that
H29 0420  2    characterized the radio-TV market.
H29 0420  7       The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961
H29 0430  6    is certainly far from clear at present, but recent
H29 0440  3    surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers
H29 0450  1    to step up their buying plans for durable goods. I
H29 0450 11    would expect that sales at retail in the first half
H29 0460  8    of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10-15% but that
H29 0470  5    second-half levels should show a favorable comparison,
H29 0480  1    with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the
H29 0480 11    year if business conditions recover as some recent
H29 0490  6    forecasts suggest they will. I look for TV sales and
H29 0500  6    production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million
H29 0510  2    sets for the year, but I look for some decline in radios
H29 0510 14    from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959
H29 0520 11    level of 15.0-15.5 million sets. I therefore believe
H29 0530  5    it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total
H29 0540  4    value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8
H29 0550  1    million, slightly below 1960, but above 1959.
H29 0550  8    #MILITARY ELECTRONICS TO GROW#
H29 0560  3    1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our
H29 0560 10    industry's shipments of military electronics, which
H29 0570  6    totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion
H29 0580  5    in 1959. It is interesting to note that the present
H29 0590  3    level of military electronics procurement is greater
H29 0590 10    than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953,
H29 0600 11    which were good years for our industry with television
H29 0610  7    enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance.
H29 0620  5    It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed
H29 0630  1    people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic
H29 0630 10    to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15%
H29 0640 10    or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's,
H29 0650  6    and that our military markets may be entering upon
H29 0660  5    a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons
H29 0670  1    systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped
H29 0670 10    areas of our defense capability. While this may well
H29 0680  9    be true in general, I believe it is also important
H29 0690  6    to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest
H29 0700  2    that over the next year or so military electronics
H29 0700 11    may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an
H29 0710 10    economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions.
H29 0720  5       Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the
H29 0730  5    near future are the POLARIS and B70 programs, strengthening
H29 0740  3    of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command,
H29 0750  3    and improved battlefield surveillance systems. Research
H29 0760  1    and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance
H29 0760  8    satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic
H29 0770  8    missile defense systems such as NIKE-ZEUS are expected
H29 0780  9    to increase substantially. Research, development test
H29 0790  4    and evaluation funds, devoted to missiles in 1960 were
H29 0800  6    3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft,
H29 0810  1    and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed
H29 0810  9    aircraft procurement by 1963. Still later, the realm
H29 0820  7    of space technology will show substantial gains; it
H29 0830  4    has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics
H29 0840  2    and Space Administration will rise from less than $500
H29 0850  2    million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967,
H29 0850 13    and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures
H29 0860  8    will be closer to 50% than the current 20%.
H29 0870  7       The stepped up defense procurement called for in
H29 0880  4    the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt
H29 0890  2    in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment
H29 0890 11    and the components that go into it, and it has been
H29 0900 11    suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in
H29 0910  5    total defense spending may be requested for fiscal
H29 0920  3    1962. Although the impact of these increases on our
H29 0920 12    industry's shipments will be gradual, on balance I
H29 0930  8    look for another good increase in shipments in the
H29 0940  6    coming year, to at least $6 billion.
H29 0940 13    #INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT#
H29 0950  3    Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic
H29 0960  3    data processing, sales of industrial and commercial
H29 0960 10    electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared
H29 0970  6    to $1.6 billion in 1959. The market for computers and
H29 0980  6    other data-handling continues to expand at the rate
H29 0990  4    of about 30% annually, reaching some $450 million in
H29 1000  1    1960. Informed estimates look for this market to approximately
H29 1000 10    quadruple by the late 1960's, under the stimulus of
H29 1010  9    new applications in the fields of banking and retailing,
H29 1020  7    industrial process control, and information storage
H29 1030  2    and retrieval. In the industrial field, prospects for
H29 1040  2    higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring
H29 1040  9    equipment are also quite bright. For the near term,
H29 1050  9    however, it must be realized that the industrial and
H29 1060  5    commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general
H29 1070  3    business conditions than is the military market, and
H29 1070 11    for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961
H29 1080 10    may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years;
H29 1090  6    sales should slightly exceed 1960, however, and reach
H29 1100  3    $1.9 billion.
H29 1100  5    #REPLACEMENT PARTS#
H29 1100  7    In addition to the three major original equipment segments
H29 1110  7    of the electronics business, the steady growth in the
H29 1120  6    market for replacement parts continues year by year.
H29 1130  4    This is now a $1.0 billion business, up from $0.9 billion
H29 1140  1    in 1959, and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961.
H29 1140 10       The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected
H29 1150  8    the changing patterns of the various end equipment
H29 1160  5    segments of the industry. Demand for parts for home
H29 1170  3    entertainment was strong in the first half, but purchases
H29 1170 12    were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set
H29 1180 11    manufacturers reduced their own operating rates. In
H29 1190  6    the military field, incoming orders turned down early
H29 1200  3    in the year, and remained rather slow until late fall
H29 1210  1    when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to
H29 1210 10    make itself felt in rising orders for components.
H29 1220  6       Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million,
H29 1230  4    compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial
H29 1240  1    price reductions in virtually all types. Production
H29 1240  8    totalled about 123 million units against 82 million
H29 1250  7    in 1959, and I look for a further gain to 188 million
H29 1260  5    units worth approximately $380 million in 1961. Sales
H29 1270  2    of passive components, such as capacitors and resistors,
H29 1270 10    although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors
H29 1280 10    were ahead of 1959 this year, and should increase again
H29 1290  8    in 1961.
H29 1290 10       In sum, I look for another good year for the electronics
H29 1300  9    industry in 1961, with total sales increasing about
H29 1310  5    7% to $10.8 billion, despite the uncertainties in the
H29 1320  3    business outlook generally. As I have indicated above,
H29 1330  1    I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness
H29 1330 11    in the market for consumer durable goods may continue
H29 1340  7    through the early months of the year, but will give
H29 1350  6    way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring
H29 1360  3    the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects
H29 1370  1    for continued increases in defense spending; and on
H29 1370  9    continued growth in the applications of electronics
H29 1380  6    to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade
H29 1390  3    in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.
H29 1410  1       The appointment of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager
H29 1420  1    of VecTrol Engineering, Inc., of Stamford, Connecticut,
