G47 0010  1       I stood on a table, surrounded by hundreds of expectant
G47 0010 11    young faces. Questions came to me from all sides about
G47 0020 10    my world citizenship activities. After making a short
G47 0030  6    statement about human rights, and the freedom to travel,
G47 0040  4    I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the
G47 0050  2    next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany.
G47 0060  1       "May we come with you"? called out a dozen young
G47 0060 10    voices.
G47 0070  1       "Well, I might not get that far", I told them, "as
G47 0070 12    actually I have no papers to enter Germany and, as
G47 0080 10    a matter of fact, no permit to return to France once
G47 0090  6    I leave".
G47 0090  8       That was all they needed. They would champion me.
G47 0100  5    We would all meet at ten o'clock at the Kehl bridge,
G47 0110  4    five miles from Strasbourg, and march triumphantly
G47 0120  1    across into Germany.
G47 0120  4       There was only one hitch: the small town of Kehl,
G47 0130  3    on the other side of the Rhine, was still under French
G47 0140  1    jurisdiction. The real Franco-German frontier was beyond
G47 0140  9    the town's limits. In fact, all persons were permitted
G47 0150  8    to cross the Rhine into Kehl, there being no sentry
G47 0160  6    posted on the west side of the river.
G47 0170  1       That evening, as I learned later, the students,
G47 0170  9    enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known
G47 0180  6    only to university students, surged out onto the streets
G47 0190  5    of Strasbourg, overturning empty streetcars, marking
G47 0200  2    up store fronts, and shouting imprudently, "Garry Davis
G47 0210  1    to power"!
G47 0210  3       As I got off the trolley at Kehl bridge the next
G47 0220  2    morning, I was met by what looked like 5,000 students,
G47 0220 12    some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the
G47 0230  7    coming "battle" with the police. Alarmed by this display
G47 0240  6    of weapons, I looked toward the bridge and there saw,
G47 0250  4    stretched across the near side, a cordon of policemen,
G47 0260  1    their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood
G47 0260  9    several French officers in uniform and a small waspish
G47 0270  8    man in a brown derby.
G47 0280  1       "Listen please", I called to the students in French.
G47 0280 10    "I thank you most heartily for being here. This is
G47 0290 10    full evidence of your support for my principles. These
G47 0300  6    principles, however, will not be served by violence
G47 0310  3    in any form. If they are right, they will prevail of
G47 0320  1    and by themselves. I ask you all to support me in this.
G47 0320 13    If one finger is raised against the authorities, all
G47 0330  7    our moral power will vanish. Your self-control in this
G47 0340  6    respect will be the only witness to your understanding
G47 0350  2    of what I am saying. I have full confidence in you.
G47 0350 13    Now, let's go".
G47 0360  3       I marched up to the waiting officials, the students
G47 0370  1    massed behind me. As usual, the press photographers
G47 0370  9    were on hand. The waspish man stopped me three paces
G47 0380  8    from the bicycle barricade, and asked me in French
G47 0390  6    if I had papers to leave France. I replied in the affirmative,
G47 0400  4    taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite et
G47 0410  2    de voyage, on which was stamped a permission to leave
G47 0410 12    Fran e. He examined it carefully, handed it back and
G47 0420 10    said, "Eh bien, you may leave France".
G47 0430  5       I took one step ... eastward.
G47 0440  1       One of the uniformed officers stepped in my way,
G47 0440 10    demanding to know whether I had permission to enter
G47 0450  7    Germany.
G47 0450  8       "No, I have no permission to enter Germany", I told
G47 0460  8    him.
G47 0460  9       "Alors, you may go no farther", he said imperiously.
G47 0470  9       "Is this then the frontier"? I asked him.
G47 0480  6       "Yes".
G47 0480  7       At this, the students let out a yell, knowing full
G47 0490  9    well the actual frontier was beyond the town of Kehl.
G47 0500  6       "But I have no permission to re-enter France, and
G47 0510  3    I have just left", I told him. "I must then be standing
G47 0520  3    on the line between France and Germany".
G47 0520 10       The waspish man stepped forward. "Line? Line? But
G47 0530  8    there is no line between France and Germany, that is,
G47 0540  7    no actual line ... I mean ..."
G47 0550  2       "No line"? I asked. "But if there is no line, how
G47 0560  2    can there be two countries? You have just given me
G47 0560 12    permission to leave France, which I did. I have witnesses.
G47 0570 10    And as you know, I have no permission to re-enter France
G47 0580  9    once out. Now I learn I cannot enter Germany. Obviously
G47 0600  4    I'm stuck on the line between the two countries".
G47 0610  2       The students were laughing uproariously at this
G47 0620  1    piece of logic, and even the policemen were trying
G47 0620 10    hard not to smile.
G47 0630  1       "Mais non", the Interior Ministry man coaxed, "you
G47 0640  1    may come back to Strasbourg, now, if you wish".
G47 0640 10       "Oh? Then will you give me a visa to re-enter France"?
G47 0650 11       "Visa? But there is no question of a visa. You are
G47 0660 11    still in France".
G47 0670  1       "Ah, then please tell me where the frontier is because
G47 0670 11    this gentleman here"- I indicated the French occupation
G47 0680  8    officer- "informs me that Germany is just on the other
G47 0690  9    side of him".
G47 0700  1       The Interior man looked uneasily at his French compatriot.
G47 0700  9    From the crowd were coming cries of "He's right"! "There
G47 0710  9    must be a line"! and "Bravo, Garry, continue"!
G47 0720  7       Seeing their hesitation, I said, "Well, until I
G47 0730  7    have permission to enter Germany, or a visa to re-enter
G47 0740  7    France, I shall be obliged to remain here ... on the
G47 0750  4    line between two countries", whereupon I moved to the
G47 0760  1    side of the road, parked my backpack against the small
G47 0760 11    guardhouse on the sidewalk, sat down, took out my typewriter,
G47 0770  9    and began typing the above conversation.
G47 0780  3       The reporters were questioning the Interior man
G47 0790  2    and the French officer, both of whom remained noncommittal
G47 0790 11    as to what action, if any, would be taken in my regard.
G47 0800 12    Finally they went off to file their stories, after
G47 0820  7    the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil.
G47 0830  5    The students crowded around asking questions, slapping
G47 0840  1    me on the back, and generally being friendly.
G47 0840  9       "But what will you do this evening, Mr. Davis"?
G47 0850  8    asked a young mustached Frenchman. "It will be very
G47 0860  6    cold".
G47 0860  7       "I don't know", I told him, "except that I will
G47 0870  8    be here".
G47 0870 10       "I shall see about getting you a tent", he said.
G47 0880  9    "I have a small sports shop in Strasbourg".
G47 0890  3       That would be a great help, I told him, thanking
G47 0900  2    him for his thoughtfulness. A special guard was posted
G47 0900 11    at my end of the bridge to make sure I didn't cross,
G47 0910 12    the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully
G47 0920  7    in that everyone else- men, women, and children, dogs,
G47 0930  5    cats, horses, cars, trucks, baby carriages- could cross
G47 0940  5    Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance.
G47 0940 11       The day passed eventfully enough, with a constant
G47 0950  8    stream of visitors, some stopping only to say hello,
G47 0960  6    others getting into serious conversations, such as
G47 0970  3    one Andre Fuchs, a free-lance journalist from Strasbourg
G47 0980  1    who wrote an article for the Nouvelle Alsatian in highly
G47 0980 11    sympathetic terms. Some students from the University
G47 0990  7    returned around six with a large pot containing enough
G47 1000  7    hot soup to last me a week. A volunteer food brigade
G47 1010  3    had been arranged, they told me, which would supply
G47 1020  1    me with the necessities as long as I remained at the
G47 1020 12    bridge. A little later, the sports shop man returned
G47 1030  7    with a small pup tent. One of the girl students, sitting
G47 1040  5    by while I ate the thick soup, asked me if I had a
G47 1050  4    sleeping bag. When I informed her that I didn't, she
G47 1050 14    said she would borrow her brother's and bring it to
G47 1060 10    me later that evening.
G47 1070  1       "You do not know me", she said in good English,
G47 1070 11    "but my mother was your governess in Philadelphia when
G47 1080  9    you were a child". Her name was Esther Peter. I was
G47 1090  8    delighted to make that personal contact in such trying
G47 1100  5    and unusual circumstances. The Peter family proved
G47 1110  2    wonderful and helpful friends in the following days,
G47 1110 10    Mrs. Peter, little Esther, and Raoul, who generously
G47 1120  8    lent me his sleeping bag for my "Watch on the Rhine".
G47 1130  8       Sighting a line from the bridge to a small field
G47 1140  7    directly to the side, I pitched the tent that evening
G47 1150  3    on the stateless "line", digging a small trench around
G47 1160  1    it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood
G47 1160 14    child. The wind from the Rhine was damp and chill,
G47 1170 10    necessitating a fire for warmth. After scouring around
G47 1180  6    a bit in the open area, I came across what proved to
G47 1190  4    be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly,
G47 1200  1    giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky.
G47 1200 11       Each evening the students appeared with the soup
G47 1210  7    kettle and several petits pains, Esther usually being
G47 1220  5    among them. I had advised friends to write me to "No
G47 1230  5    Man's Land, Pont Kehl, Between Strasbourg and Kehl,
G47 1240  2    France-Germany". Sure enough, mail began trickling
G47 1240  9    in, delivered by a talkative, highly amused French
G47 1250  8    postman who informed me there had been quite a debate
G47 1260  7    at the post office as to whether that address would
G47 1270  3    be recognized.
G47 1270  5       On Christmas Eve, students brought out two small
G47 1280  4    Christmas trees which I placed on either side of the
G47 1290  1    tent. As the field on which my tent was pitched was
G47 1290 12    a favorite natural playground for the kids of the neighborhood,
G47 1300  8    I had made many friends among them, taking part in
G47 1310  6    their after-school games and trying desperately to
G47 1320  2    translate Grimm's Fairy Tales into an understandable
G47 1330  1    French as we gathered around the fire in front of the
G47 1330 12    tent. To my great surprise and delight, when they saw
G47 1340  7    the two trees they went rushing off, returning shortly
G47 1350  4    with decorations from their own trees.
G47 1360  1       It was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for me
G47 1360 11    that year.
G47 1360 13    ##
G47 1370  1    In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities
G47 1370 11    of Cologne, Heidelberg, and Baden-Baden. Twenty thousand
G47 1380  7    world citizens at Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting
G47 1390  7    me to visit their town. When Dr. Adenauer was approached
G47 1400  5    by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition
G47 1410  4    of my case, he gave them his personal approval of my
G47 1420  3    entry, saying that all men advocating peace should
G47 1420 11    be welcomed into Germany. The special guard, however,
G47 1430  6    was still posted on Kehl bridge.
G47 1440  1       As it began raining at around eight o'clock on December
G47 1450  1    26th, I retired into my tent early, somewhat tired
G47 1450 10    and discouraged, my body reacting sluggishly because
G47 1460  2    of the continued exposure. No matter how large the
G47 1470  4    fire, I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day.
G47 1480  2       "Oh, Mr. Davis, are you there"? a voice drifted
G47 1490  1    in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after
G47 1490 12    I had fallen into a fitful sleep.
G47 1500  5       "Who is it"?
G47 1500  8       "We're from the Council of Europe, British delegation.
G47 1510  7    May we have a word with you"?
G47 1520  2       "I'm sorry. I've had a trying day and I just can't
G47 1530  2    make it out again", I told them.
G47 1530  9       I heard nothing more. Later I learned that Sir Hugh
G47 1540  8    Dalton had expressed a desire to see me, hence their
G47 1550  6    trip to "No Man's Land".
G47 1550 11       On the evening of December 27th, Esther noticed
G47 1560  8    my pallid look and rasping voice. She entreated me
G47 1570  5    to see a doctor, and when I refused, brought one out
G47 1580  3    to see me. He advised immediate hospitalization. I
G47 1580 11    wouldn't hear of it because it meant giving up the
G47 1590 10    "line", though I realized I was in poor shape physically.
G47 1600  8    Esther, mistaking my hesitation, assured me that the
G47 1610  5    hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading
G47 1620  3    merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached.
G47 1620 11       "No, it's not that", I told her. "You see, once
G47 1630 11    I relinquish the position I've already established
G47 1640  6    here, I couldn't regain it without sacrificing the
G47 1650  5    logic of it".
G47 1650  8       At that moment, up walked a tall young man with
G47 1660  8    glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from
G47 1670  4    Basel, Switzerland. Without preliminaries, Esther asked
G47 1680  2    him, "If you are a world citizen, will you take Garry
G47 1680 13    Davis' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital"?
G47 1700  1       "But of course, with pleasure", he replied.
G47 1700  7       Esther looked at me. I looked from her to him.
G47 1710  8       "What is your name"? I asked him.
G47 1720  3       "Jean Babel".
G47 1720  5       "Shake", I said. "You have just enlisted for the
G47 1730  6    'Rhine Campaign'".
G47 1730  8       Esther jumped up, ran to him and gave him a little
G47 1740 11    hug.
G47 1740 12       "I am so happy. Now come, Garry, we must go quickly.
G47 1750 10    There is a police car outside. Maybe they will take
G47 1760  6    us".
G47 1760  7       Such were the incongruities of the situation that
G47 1770  5    the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted
G47 1780  3    into driving me to the Strasbourg Hospital while World
G47 1790  1    Citizen Jean Babel waved adieu from the "Line"!
