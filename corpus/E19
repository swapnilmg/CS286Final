E19 0010  1       It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired
E19 0010 13    a swimming pool- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous,
E19 0020  5    not wholly unrewarding years. We have learned a lot-
E19 0030  7    a dash of hydrochemistry here, a bit about plumbing
E19 0040  4    and pump-priming there. We have had sound grounding
E19 0050  1    in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove
E19 0050 11    school of diplomacy. We have become amateur insurance
E19 0060  6    experts and fine-feathered yard birds. True, our problems
E19 0070  5    have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors
E19 0080  3    have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular
E19 0090  1    attractions. But problems cling to pools, as any pool
E19 0090 10    owner knows. So our innate generosity of spirit prompts
E19 0100  8    us to share our trials, errors and solutions with any
E19 0110  6    who are taking the pool plunge for the first time-
E19 0120  3    in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.
E19 0130  1    #WHERE TO PUT IT#
E19 0130  5    Position may not be everything, but in the case of
E19 0140  3    a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social
E19 0140 11    and/or physical. We speak from varying viewpoints.
E19 0150  7    One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near
E19 0160  7    the house. The other has his pool far away from the
E19 0170  3    house in a field high on a hill.
E19 0170 11       If you are dreaming of a blue, shimmering pool right
E19 0180  7    outside your living room windows, close your eyes firmly
E19 0190  5    and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children,
E19 0200  2    damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated
E19 0210  1    plastic toys. You are likely to be nearer the truth.
E19 0210 11       You can also see that the greater the proximity
E19 0220  8    of the pool to your main living quarters, the greater
E19 0230  4    the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying
E19 0240  1    noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude.
E19 0240 11    On the other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind
E19 0250 13    when children cannot be easily observed and you have
E19 0260  8    to make a long trek to reach the pool.
E19 0270  2       Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond
E19 0270 10    in the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard
E19 0280 12    to the well-being of a pool. Yet a grassy approach
E19 0290  8    can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the
E19 0300  5    grass is mowed.
E19 0300  8       As in choosing a wife, it is only sensible to consider
E19 0310  6    also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather
E19 0320  4    as well as in good. In the colder climes, for instance,
E19 0330  1    you will have to live through the many unglamorous
E19 0330 10    winter months when your pool will hardly look its best.
E19 0340  8    It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt
E19 0350  4    hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a neat,
E19 0360  2    plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.
E19 0360 12    (We do, however, recommend those patented covers to
E19 0370  7    prevent both people and junk- flora and fauna generally-
E19 0380  7    from accidentally wintering in the pool.)
E19 0390  2       Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all
E19 0390 12    counts. Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent
E19 0400 10    by the shape and size of your land. But if space and
E19 0410  9    money are no problem and small children are not on
E19 0420  4    hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have
E19 0430  1    your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate
E19 0430 10    environs of the house. And a good several feet around
E19 0440 10    the pool should be neither greensward nor woods, but
E19 0450  5    good hard pavement.
E19 0450  8       The placement of your pool, however, will not of
E19 0460  8    itself solve the two major problems of pool owning-
E19 0470  4    those that involve your social life and those pertaining
E19 0480  1    to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline-
E19 0480  9    of yourself as well as of your family, neighbors, friends
E19 0490  9    and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet.
E19 0500  7       Eight years ago while we were going through the
E19 0510  4    mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were each
E19 0520  2    solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening
E19 0520 12    home-comings to a cool family collected around the
E19 0530  8    pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord
E19 0540  6    and master's delectation. But not even our first pool-side
E19 0550  1    gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.
E19 0560  1    We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion
E19 0560  9    right in our own backyards. Our respective families
E19 0570  5    looked as if they had quadrupled. Had we taken a lien
E19 0580  6    on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been discovered
E19 0590  2    by the pool sharks. We were in business!
E19 0590 10       From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen
E19 0600  9    was a short step- no more than the change from city
E19 0610 10    clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us, maybe, but the results
E19 0620  5    of our impulsive invitations to "come over next summer
E19 0630  3    and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and
E19 0630 13    unsettling.
E19 0640  1    #OUR BOOK OF ETIQUETTE#
E19 0640  5    After the first few weeks, it was obvious that rules
E19 0650  4    had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our popularity
E19 0660  2    ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made,
E19 0670  1    in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this
E19 0670  9    respect coincided precisely, we present the fruits
E19 0680  6    of our efforts herewith as a single social code for
E19 0690  4    pool owners.
E19 0690  6       First and foremost: No one- no, not anyone- in the
E19 0700  6    family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his
E19 0710  3    or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally
E19 0710 14    managed to coerce our children to this view. Their
E19 0720  9    friends and ours are welcome to share the pool, but
E19 0730  7    on our terms and at our times.
E19 0740  1       No friends are to arrive without an invitation or
E19 0740 10    without at least telephoning beforehand.
E19 0750  2       No ringers, either- even if they are trailing legitimate
E19 0760  2    invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone
E19 0770  1    exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that
E19 0770 11    we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like
E19 0780 10    Coney Island in August.
E19 0790  1       No young children may come without adults except
E19 0790  9    for a specific, organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying
E19 0800  6    adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye
E19 0810  7    on their responsibilities. A gaggle of gabbling mothers,
E19 0820  4    backs to the pool, is no safeguard.
E19 0820 11       No bottle pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our
E19 0830  8    lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our
E19 0840  7    bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run.
E19 0850  3    (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant
E19 0850 11    took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently
E19 0860  9    became the neighborhood free-drink stop.)
E19 0870  4       We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood
E19 0880  3    teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has saved
E19 0890  2    us from constant requests seven days a week and made
E19 0890 12    us feel less brutal to the young "less fortunate" than
E19 0900  8    ours.
E19 0900  9       We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon
E19 0910  7    swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend
E19 0920  5    guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch
E19 0930  2    en famille. We gently usher them to an island of tables
E19 0940  1    and chairs strategically placed on the far side of
E19 0940 10    the pool where they can amuse each other until we get
E19 0950  9    ready to merge sides.
E19 0950 13       All dressing (undressing to be more exact) must
E19 0960  8    be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers'
E19 0970  6    homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping
E19 0980  3    parade through your house, it is a good idea to have
E19 0980 14    a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct
E19 0990 10    outdoor route between the pool and the parking area.)
E19 1000  7    We do, however, provide a limited number of extra suits,
E19 1010  5    mainly for children, and we stock extra towels and
E19 1020  2    a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers,
E19 1020  9    the buckle-on kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness,
E19 1030  8    too, for the very young.
E19 1040  1    #PRESERVING LIFE AND LIMB#
E19 1040  5    Safety rules, of course, are more important than all
E19 1050  4    the others put together.
E19 1050  8       In many localities, now, the law requires all pools
E19 1060  7    to be fenced, usually to a minimum height of 5 feet.
E19 1070  5    But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place for
E19 1080  2    running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance
E19 1080 10    contests, either, or inexpert versions of water polo.
E19 1090  8       Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces (coco
E19 1100  6    matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots
E19 1110  3    quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent).
E19 1110 10    And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap,
E19 1120 10    either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge.
E19 1130  8       Our pools also have wide, shallow steps- for the
E19 1140  3    benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced
E19 1150  3    to the water with far greater safety than a ladder
E19 1150 13    affords.
E19 1160  1       All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from
E19 1160 11    the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of
E19 1170  9    plastic or metal cups.
E19 1180  1       When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend-
E19 1180 10    for your own mental health- a good long chat with your
E19 1190 10    insurance agent. You should be prepared to cope with
E19 1200  7    any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow
E19 1210  4    ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.
E19 1220  1       Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are
E19 1220 10    the result of a constant and careful contest with the
E19 1230 10    elements. Unless you want to make your wife a pool
E19 1240  9    widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours
E19 1250  3    nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and feeding-
E19 1260  1    from pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best
E19 1260 10    left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.
E19 1270  9    Of course, if your pool is close to the house, your
E19 1280  8    wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores (you
E19 1290  3    hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming
E19 1300  1    for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case
E19 1300 11    of emergency, should have some idea of what makes things
E19 1310  9    work. A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders
E19 1320  6    may well be appreciated in a future crisis.
E19 1330  2    #PRESERVING THE POOL#
E19 1330  5    A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool
E19 1340  5    poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The
E19 1350  1    walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without
E19 1350 10    professional help, you will have to be able to do some
E19 1360 11    of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time
E19 1370  7    pool nurse.
E19 1370  9       You should see to it that the trap, the dirt-catcher
E19 1380  7    in front of the filter, is always clean. A pool is
E19 1390  4    no place for a shut trap.
E19 1390 10       You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair
E19 1400  7    pins be worn in the water. When shed, they leave rust
E19 1410  4    marks.
E19 1410  5       You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning,
E19 1420  2    your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing
E19 1430  1    and furbishing. It has happened.
E19 1430  6       Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved, however,
E19 1440  5    if you remove the main drain grate when you close the
E19 1450  3    pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand
E19 1450 14    by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are
E19 1460 11    still wet. Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily
E19 1470  8    removed when damp, but requires dynamite if allowed
E19 1480  3    to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you
E19 1480 17    may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is
E19 1490 11    out. Of course, when your 6-inch torrent of water is
E19 1500  8    released, it may cause a lot of comment as it passes
E19 1510  4    through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget
E19 1520  1    this possibility.
E19 1520  3       If your pool is located on or near sloping ground,
E19 1530  2    it may have natural drainage which is certainly more
E19 1530 11    desirable than to be faced with the annual expense
E19 1540  9    and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping
E19 1550  7    out all the debris.
E19 1550 11       It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an
E19 1560  7    evening scene, but lights also attract all the insect
E19 1570  4    life for miles around. Once on the water, these little
E19 1580  2    visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering
E19 1580 11    and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping
E19 1590  8    good time for all those present. Often one floodlight
E19 1600  5    high in a tree will provide all the light you need
E19 1610  3    at much less expense.
E19 1610  7       Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy
E19 1620  7    the best equipment possible, from pipes to brushes.
E19 1630  1    Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be
E19 1630 10    sure that one person (in the family or not) is regularly
E19 1640  9    responsible for each aspect of the job, with no chance
E19 1650  7    for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".
E19 1660  1       Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at
E19 1660 12    the valves- even if the little boys do want to play
E19 1670 10    space ship. You may find yourself hitting bottom, literally,
E19 1680  4    as you discover that water is running out even while
E19 1690  4    you are putting it in.
