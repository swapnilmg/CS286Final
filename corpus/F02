F02 0010  1       @ She was just another freighter from the States,
F02 0010 10    and she seemed as commonplace as her name. She was
F02 0020  8    the John Harvey, one of those Atlantic sea-horses that
F02 0030  7    had sailed to Bari to bring beans, bombs, and bullets
F02 0040  4    to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force, to Field Marshal Montgomery's
F02 0050  3    Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of
F02 0060  3    Italy in that early December of 1943.
F02 0060 10       The John Harvey arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic,
F02 0070  9    on November 28th, making for Porto Nuovo, which, as
F02 0080  7    the name indicates, was the ancient city's new and
F02 0090  4    modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she
F02 0100  2    anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone
F02 0100 13    thought of the John Harvey, it was to observe that
F02 0110 10    she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden
F02 0120  7    with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey
F02 0130  4    would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever
F02 0140  2    else it was that she carried.
F02 0140  8       Which was poison gas.
F02 0150  1    ##
F02 0150  2    It had required the approval of President Franklin
F02 0150 10    Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded
F02 0160  8    with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the
F02 0170  7    Italian warfront. For in a world as yet unacquainted
F02 0180  4    with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas
F02 0190  1    was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.
F02 0190 10       Throughout the early years of World War II, reports
F02 0200  9    persisted that the Axis powers had used gas- Germany
F02 0210  7    in Russia, Japan in China again. They were always denied.
F02 0220  5    Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon
F02 0230  3    to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the
F02 0240  2    Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so
F02 0240 10    far as to urge our using it first. To silence extremists,
F02 0250  9    to warn the Axis, President Roosevelt issued this statement
F02 0260  5    for the Allies in August:
F02 0270  1       "From time to time since the present war began there
F02 0270 11    have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers
F02 0280 11    were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or
F02 0290  6    noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare.
F02 0300  3    I have been loath to believe that any nation, even
F02 0300 13    our present enemies, could or would be willing to loose
F02 0310 10    upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons.
F02 0320  5       "However, evidence that the Axis powers are making
F02 0330  5    significant preparations indicative of such an intention
F02 0340  2    is being reported with increasing frequency from a
F02 0340 10    variety of sources.
F02 0350  3       "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general
F02 0360  2    opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not
F02 0360 10    used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled
F02 0370 10    to use them. I state categorically that we shall under
F02 0380  5    no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons
F02 0390  2    unless they are first used by our enemies".
F02 0390 10       The following month the invasion of Italy was begun,
F02 0400  9    and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting
F02 0410  7    to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy.
F02 0420  3    Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming
F02 0430  1    safety, but because of its proximity to airfields.
F02 0430  9    Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne. It would
F02 0440  8    be made in three waves- the first to lay down a smokescreen,
F02 0450  7    the second to drop the gas bombs, the third to shower
F02 0460  4    incendiaries which would burn everything below.
F02 0470  1       So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John
F02 0470 12    Harvey. A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical
F02 0480  8    Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom
F02 0490  6    went aboard, followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson,
F02 0500  4    the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy was paramount.
F02 0510  3    Only a few other people- very important people- knew
F02 0520  1    of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No
F02 0520 10    one else must know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in
F02 0530  8    the way of the right hand that knows and the left that
F02 0540  6    does not- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari.
F02 0550  3       It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was
F02 0550 14    growing dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock
F02 0560 11    and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its
F02 0580  8    eighth straight visit. Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office
F02 0590  7    of Harbor Defense was very worried. He knew that German
F02 0600  6    long-range bombers had been returning to the attack
F02 0610  4    in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on
F02 0610 15    La Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck
F02 0620 11    at a convoy off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it
F02 0630  8    had been that very night that the Me-210 had made
F02 0640  6    its first appearance. After it had reappeared the next
F02 0650  3    two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:
F02 0660  1       "For three days now a German reconnaissance plane
F02 0660  9    has been over the city taking pictures. They're just
F02 0670  8    waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump
F02 0680  8    this place into the Adriatic".
F02 0690  1       But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his
F02 0690 10    warning as alarmist. Even though it was known that
F02 0700  7    the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by
F02 0710  4    the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander
F02 0720  1    who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944,
F02 0720 11    a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was
F02 0730 12    not to be considered seriously. True, there had been
F02 0740  6    raids on Naples- but Naples was pretty far north on
F02 0750  5    the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range. More
F02 0760  2    than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the
F02 0760 11    Eighth Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to
F02 0770  8    his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in
F02 0780  6    five more appearances, and to feel the certainty of
F02 0790  3    this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's
F02 0800  1    defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had
F02 0800 11    but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon
F02 0810  8    units available. There were no R.A.F. fighter squadrons
F02 0820  6    on Bari airfield. The radar station with the best location
F02 0830  7    was still not serviceable. Telephone communication
F02 0840  2    was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining
F02 0850  2    defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster-
F02 0850 10    multiple command.
F02 0860  2       It had been made shockingly evident that very morning
F02 0870  1    to Ensign Kay K. Vesole, in charge of the armed guard
F02 0870 12    aboard the John Bascom. A British officer had come
F02 0880  8    aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack
F02 0890  8    he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped.
F02 0900  4    Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled
F02 0910  1    shore gun firing white tracers.
F02 0910  6       "This harbor is a bomber's paradise", the Britisher
F02 0920  6    had said with frank grimness. "It's up to you to protect
F02 0930  7    yourselves. We can't expect any help from the fighters
F02 0940  5    at Foggia, either. They're all being used on offensive
F02 0950  2    missions".
F02 0950  3       Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until the bombs
F02 0960  3    came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable
F02 0970  1    fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell!
F02 0970 11    Like hell he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled
F02 0980  8    gun got knocked out? What would his guns guide on then-
F02 0990  8    the North Star? Ensign Vesole decided that he would
F02 1000  6    not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs,
F02 1010  4    and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/c Donald
F02 1020  1    L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the
F02 1020 11    guns and told them to start shooting the moment they
F02 1030 10    saw an enemy silhouette. Below decks, Seaman 1/c Stanley
F02 1040  6    Bishop had begun to write a letter home.
F02 1050  4    ##
F02 1050  5    Above decks on the John Harvey, Lieutenant Richardson
F02 1060  2    gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall
F02 1060 12    and felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the
F02 1070  9    city, too, even though it was now dark enough for a
F02 1080  8    few stars to become visible. Bari was asking for it,
F02 1090  4    he thought.
F02 1090  6       For five days now, they had been in port and that
F02 1100  5    filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered
F02 1110  1    when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put
F02 1110 11    it somewhere way, way down in the earth. The burden
F02 1120  8    of his secret was pressing down on him, as it was on
F02 1130  7    Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men. Lieutenant
F02 1140  2    Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John
F02 1150  1    Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained
F02 1150 10    nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They
F02 1160  8    seemed happy at the delay in unloading, glad at the
F02 1170  7    chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as
F02 1180  4    Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.
F02 1190  1    Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks
F02 1190 10    had been the first to leave. Richardson had returned
F02 1200  9    their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that
F02 1210  6    is the security officer's stock in trade.
F02 1220  2       The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his
F02 1220 12    men, had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea
F02 1230  8    and started slightly. Damned if that wasn't a sailing
F02 1240  7    ship standing out of the old harbor- Porto Vecchio.
F02 1250  5    The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty
F02 1260  2    making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless
F02 1270  1    sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes
F02 1270 11    boggled.
F02 1280  1       It was a clear night and it was raining!
F02 1280 10       Capt. Michael A. Musmanno, Military governor of
F02 1290  6    the Sorrentine Peninsula, had also seen and felt the
F02 1300  6    "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.
F02 1310  1       Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant
F02 1320  1    name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a
F02 1320 10    cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's
F02 1330  6    civilian population. Musmanno was on deck. At exactly
F02 1340  6    7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush his face. He
F02 1350  4    snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his
F02 1350 14    flashlight on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil
F02 1360 10    from the chocolate bar he had been eating. He frowned.
F02 1370  8    But how could-? Another, longer strip of tinsel whipped
F02 1390  6    his mouth. It was two feet long. It was not candy wrapping.
F02 1400  4       It was "window"- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers
F02 1410  4    to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds
F02 1420  1    of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.
F02 1420 10       "Fermate"! Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen.
F02 1430  7    "Stop! Stop the engines"!
F02 1440  3       Unsinkable slowed and stopped, hundreds of brilliant
F02 1450  3    white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the
F02 1450 12    air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the
F02 1460 10    anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered- and above
F02 1470  5    it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering
F02 1480  2    and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor
F02 1490  1    at Bari.
F02 1490  3       They had come from airports in the Balkans, these
F02 1500  1    hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the
F02 1500 10    Adriatic, they had taken Bari by complete surprise
F02 1510  7    and now they were battering her, attacking with deadly
F02 1520  4    skill. They had ruined the radar warning system with
F02 1530  2    their window, they had made themselves invisible above
F02 1530 10    their flares. And they also had the lights of the city,
F02 1540 10    the port wall lanterns, and a shore crane's spotlight
F02 1550  6    to guide on. After the first two were blacked out,
F02 1560  4    the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian
F02 1570  1    crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes
F02 1570 11    like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's
F02 1580  6    shot it out.
F02 1580  9       In that interval, the German bombers made a hell
F02 1590  8    of Bari harbor.
F02 1590 11       Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares,
F02 1600  9    made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished
F02 1610  8    mud, were impossible to miss. The little Unsinkable
F02 1620  4    sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno roared at
F02 1630  3    his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together
F02 1630 15    for a raft. They got it over the side and clambered
F02 1640 11    aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went
F02 1650  6    under.
F02 1650  7       John Bascom went down early, too. Ensign Vesole
F02 1660  7    and his gunners had fought valiantly, but they had
F02 1670  4    no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the blinding
F02 1680  2    light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore
F02 1680 11    gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks
F02 1690 10    of bombs. Vesole rushed from gun to gun, attempting
F02 1700  6    to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought on. Norton
F02 1710  3    and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.
F02 1720  1    Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20mm gun, pumping
F02 1720 11    out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed
F02 1730  8    into Holds One, Three and Five. Now the Bascom was
F02 1740  6    mortally wounded. Luckily, she was not completely aflame
F02 1750  4    and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.
F02 1760  1       The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of
F02 1760 11    pain could be heard from the wounded below decks.
