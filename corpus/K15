K15 0010  1       Beth was very still and her breath came in small
K15 0010 11    jerking gasps. The thin legs twitched convulsively
K15 0020  6    once, then Kate felt the little body stiffening in
K15 0030  4    her arms and heard one strangled sound. The scant flesh
K15 0040  2    grew cool beneath her frantic hands. The child was
K15 0040 11    gone.
K15 0050  1       When Juanita awoke, Kate was still rocking the dead
K15 0050 10    child, still crooning in disbelief, "No, no, oh, no!"
K15 0060  8       They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent
K15 0070  9    for the young Presbyterian minister. He sat beside
K15 0080  5    Kate's bed with the others throughout the morning,
K15 0090  2    talking, talking of God's will, while Kate lay staring
K15 0090 11    angrily at him. When he told her God had called the
K15 0100 11    child to Him, she rejected his words rebelliously.
K15 0110  5       Few of the neighbors came, but Mrs. Tussle came,
K15 0120  4    called by tragedy. "It always comes in threes", she
K15 0130  3    sighed heavily. "Trouble never comes but in threes".
K15 0140  1       They held the funeral the next morning from the
K15 0140 10    crossroads church and buried the little box in the
K15 0150  9    quiet family plot. Kate moved through all the preparations
K15 0160  5    and services in a state of bewilderment. She would
K15 0170  3    not accept the death of such a little child. "God called
K15 0180  1    her to Him", the minister had said. God would not do
K15 0180 12    that, Kate thought stubbornly.
K15 0190  4       Jonathan's letter came, as she knew it would, and
K15 0200  4    he had accepted their child's death as another judgment
K15 0210  1    from God against both Kate and himself. In blind panic
K15 0210 11    of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum, and believed
K15 0220  7    in her desperation that she had been cursed by God.
K15 0230  7    She held Jonathan's letter, his words burning like
K15 0240  3    a brand, and knew suddenly that the bonds between them
K15 0250  1    were severed. She had nothing left but her duty to
K15 0250 11    his land and his son. Joel came and sat mutely with
K15 0260  8    her, sharing her pain and anguish, averting his eyes
K15 0270  4    from the ice packs on her bosom.
K15 0270 11       Juanita and Mrs. Tussle kept Kate in bed a week
K15 0280  9    until her milk dried. When she returned to life in
K15 0290  6    the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save
K15 0300  2    dedication to duty. She disciplined herself daily to
K15 0300 10    do what must be done. She had even steeled herself
K15 0310  9    to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the
K15 0320  7    empty nursery, although the girl tried to insist on
K15 0330  4    moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance
K15 0330 13    of the baby's death.
K15 0340  4       Juanita drooped about the place, wearing a haunted,
K15 0350  3    brooding look, which Kate attributed to the baby's
K15 0350 11    death, until the day a letter came for her addressed
K15 0360 10    to "Miss Juanita Fitzroy", bearing a Grafton postmark.
K15 0370  5    Seeing the slanting hand, Kate knew uneasily that it
K15 0380  5    was from the Yankee colonel. The Federal forces had
K15 0390  3    taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were
K15 0390 12    moving to take all the mountains. Kate tried to contain
K15 0400 10    her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended,
K15 0410  8    at what involvement existed for Juanita.
K15 0420  3       Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom
K15 0430  1    lands with difficulty, for more of the slaves, including
K15 0430 10    Annie, had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp.
K15 0440  9    Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after
K15 0450  6    school. He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since
K15 0460  3    they returned from Harpers Ferry. Kate felt she had
K15 0470  2    deserted the boy in her own loss. She loved him and
K15 0470 13    missed his company.
K15 0480  1       Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening
K15 0480  9    on some secret business of his own. What it was Kate
K15 0490 10    could not fathom. He claimed to be visiting the waterfront
K15 0500  7    saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with
K15 0510  5    his cronies, but Kate had not smelled brandy on him
K15 0520  3    since Mrs. Lattimer's funeral. Joel knew what he was
K15 0520 12    about, however.
K15 0530  2       "You're gonna get caught", she heard Joel say to
K15 0540  3    Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning.
K15 0540 10       "Not this old fox", chuckled Uncle Randolph. "Everybody
K15 0550  6    knows I'm just a harmless, deaf old man who takes to
K15 0560  9    drink. I aim to keep a little whisky still back in
K15 0570  4    the ridge for my pleasure".
K15 0570  9       "Whisky still, my foot", said Joel. "You're back
K15 0580  7    there riding with the guerrillas, the Moccasin Rangers".
K15 0590  5       "Hush", said Uncle Randolph, smiling, "or I'll give
K15 0600  6    you another black eye". He patted the eye Joel had
K15 0610  6    had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads
K15 0620  3    some days back.
K15 0620  6       Kate had no idea what they were talking of, although
K15 0630  4    she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning
K15 0640  2    and winking on the ridges at night, had heard horsemen
K15 0640 12    on the River Road and hill trails through the nights
K15 0650  9    till dawn. Stranger, Uncle Randolph began riding home
K15 0660  6    nights with a jug strapped to his saddle, drunkenly
K15 0670  2    singing "Old Dan Tucker" at the top of his voice. Hearing
K15 0680  2    his voice ring raucously up from the road, Kate would
K15 0680 12    await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked
K15 0690  9    into the house, cold sober. What he was about became
K15 0700  7    clear to her with the circulation of another broadside
K15 0710  3    proclamation by General McClellan, threatening reprisals
K15 0720  2    against Rebel guerrillas. She was taken up in worry
K15 0720 11    for the reckless old man.
K15 0730  4       Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel
K15 0740  2    through the hot days of summer work. She had taken
K15 0740 12    him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for
K15 0750  8    the summer, after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across
K15 0760  6    the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in
K15 0770  3    the schoolroom. Kate had walked past the school on
K15 0770 12    her morning chores and had seen the whole incident,
K15 0780  8    had seen Joel's burning humiliation before Miss Snow's
K15 0790  5    cold, bespectacled wrath. He had the hardest pains
K15 0800  4    of growing before him now, as he approached twelve.
K15 0810  1    These would be his hardest years, she knew, and he
K15 0810 11    missed his father desperately.
K15 0820  2       She tried to find some way to draw him out, to help
K15 0830  2    him. Whenever she found time, she went blackberry picking
K15 0830 11    with him, and they would come home together, mouths
K15 0840  9    purple, arms and faces scratched, tired enough to forget
K15 0850  6    grief for another day. He tended the new colts Beau
K15 0870  3    had sired. He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower
K15 0880  1    garden in the side yard, where they sometimes sat in
K15 0880 11    the still evenings watching the last fat bees working
K15 0890  7    against the summer's purple dusk.
K15 0900  1       No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle
K15 0900 11    Randolph. They stayed in their own world on the bluff,
K15 0910 10    waiting for letters and the peddler, bringing the news.
K15 0930  3    Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers
K15 0940  3    Ferry before they abandoned it; of their first engagement
K15 0950  2    at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade had
K15 0960  2    destroyed all the rolling stock of the B+O Railroad.
K15 0960 11    The men were restive, he wrote, ready to take the battle
K15 0970 10    to the enemy as Jackson wished.
K15 0980  2       The peddler came bawling his wares and told them
K15 0990  1    of the convention in Wheeling, Which had formed a new
K15 0990 11    state government by declaring the government at Richmond
K15 1000  7    in the east illegal because they were traitors. Dangling
K15 1010  5    his gaudy trinkets before them, he told of the Rebel
K15 1020  4    losses in the mountains, at Cheat and Rich mountains
K15 1030  1    both, and the Federal march on Beverly.
K15 1030  8       "Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills, they did!
K15 1040  7    They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia,
K15 1050  4    them traitors! The Federals is making everybody take
K15 1060  3    the oath of loyalty around these parts too", he crowed.
K15 1070  1       After he had gone, Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly,
K15 1070 10    "Would you take their oath"?
K15 1080  5       And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh
K15 1090  5    and said, "Hell, yes! I think I've taken it about fifty
K15 1100  4    times already"! winking at Joel's look of shock.
K15 1110  1       Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death
K15 1110 11    of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with
K15 1120  9    the South "And, dear Kate", she wrote, "poor Dr. Breckenridge's
K15 1130  7    son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go
K15 1140  9    South, to his good father's sorrow. Maj. Anderson of
K15 1150  5    Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the
K15 1160  3    U.S. Army. In spite of the fact that the state legislature
K15 1170  2    voted us neutral, John Hunt Morgan is openly flying
K15 1180  1    the Confederate flag over his woolen factory"!
K15 1180  8       Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up
K15 1190  8    the valley. Accounts were garbled at the telegraph
K15 1200  4    office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg
K15 1210  1    for the news.
K15 1210  4       "All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction
K15 1220  2    and it were a big fight", the old man told them.
K15 1230  1       In the next few days they had cause to rejoice.
K15 1230 11    It had been a big battle, and the Confederate forces
K15 1240  8    had won. Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of
K15 1250  7    the dead or on that of the missing. Kate and Mrs. Tussle
K15 1260  3    waited for letters anxiously. Joel went to the crest
K15 1270  1    of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory
K15 1270 12    bonfire to celebrate. When Kate hurried in alarm to
K15 1280  7    tell him to put it out, she saw other dots of flames
K15 1290  6    among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered
K15 1300  2    fires of the faithful. They all prayed now that the
K15 1300 12    North would realize that peace must come, for Virginia
K15 1310  9    had defended her land victoriously.
K15 1320  2       The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the
K15 1330  3    yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest
K15 1330 13    when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs
K15 1340  9    window. They had already lost most of their corn, she
K15 1350  7    thought. Were they to be insulted again because of
K15 1360  3    the South's great victory? She remembered McClellan's
K15 1370  1    last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the
K15 1370  9    stairs.
K15 1380  1       At the landing she saw Juanita, her face flushed
K15 1380 10    pink with excitement, run down the hall from the kitchen
K15 1390  8    to the front door. Juanita stopped just inside the
K15 1400  5    open door, her hand to her mouth. As Kate came swiftly
K15 1410  3    down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed
K15 1420  1    in the doorway, his face set in the same vulnerable
K15 1420 11    look Juanita wore. Kate greeted him gravely, uneasy
K15 1430  6    with misgivings at his visit.
K15 1440  1       "What brings you here again, Colonel Marsh"? she
K15 1440  9    asked, taking him and Juanita into the parlor where
K15 1450  9    the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun.
K15 1460  5       "I stopped to say goodbye, Mrs. Lattimer, and to
K15 1470  4    tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby. I
K15 1480  2    wish our doctor could have saved her".
K15 1480  9       "It was a terrible loss to me", said Kate quietly,
K15 1490  7    feeling the pain twist again at the mention, knowing
K15 1500  5    now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton.
K15 1510  2    "Where will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg"?
K15 1520  1    she asked him, seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak.
K15 1520  9       "As you know, General McClellan has been occupying
K15 1530  8    Beverly. He has notified me that he has orders to go
K15 1540  9    to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac.
K15 1550  5    I am to go to Washington to serve with him".
K15 1560  1       "When are you to leave"? Kate asked, watching them
K15 1560 10    both now anxiously. Their eyes betrayed too much of
K15 1570  9    their emotions, she thought sadly.
K15 1580  3       "Tomorrow. Would you permit Juanita to walk about
K15 1590  2    the grounds with me for a short spell, Mrs. Lattimer"?
K15 1600  1       "Stay here in the parlor where it's cool", she said,
K15 1600 11    trying to be calm. It would be better for Joel and
K15 1610 11    Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them.
K15 1620  7       Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of
K15 1630  5    the supper preparations. Then she took iced lemonade
K15 1640  1    to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the
K15 1640 13    big trees around the flower garden. When Marsh called
K15 1650  8    to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road
K15 1660  7    where the gentians burned blue, Juanita was shaken
K15 1670  3    and trying not to cry. She sought Kate out upstairs,
K15 1680  1    her lips trembling.
K15 1680  4       "He wants me to go with him tomorrow", she told
K15 1690  3    Kate.
K15 1690  4       "What do you want to do"? Kate asked, uneasy at
K15 1700  3    the gravity of the girl's dilemma.
K15 1700  9       "I could go with him. He knows me as your niece,
K15 1710  9    which, of course, I am. But I am a slave! You own me.
K15 1720  7    It's your decision", said Juanita, holding her face
K15 1730  4    very still, trying to contain the bitterness of her
K15 1740  1    voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly.
K15 1740  9       "No, the decision is yours. I have held your papers
K15 1750  9    of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer".
