F30 0010  1    Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious
F30 0010  9    and beautiful. The buildings are mostly Georgian. The
F30 0020  6    Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion,
F30 0030  4    as he once did. But his is still a simple life relatively
F30 0040  2    free of the female presence or influence, and he must
F30 0040 12    go far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated
F30 0050 10    pleasures. He is still heir to the rare gifts of space
F30 0060  9    and silence, if he chooses to be.
F30 0070  1       He is by no means the country boy he might have
F30 0070 12    been in the last century, down from the hills with
F30 0080  8    bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning
F30 0090  4    in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street
F30 0100  3    compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven.
F30 0110  1    And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each
F30 0110 10    weekend, toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke,
F30 0120  8    are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or
F30 0130  5    West Philadelphia. But there has always been an outdoor
F30 0140  5    air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate and the
F30 0150  3    citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment.
F30 0150 10    No one here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives
F30 0160 10    rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere
F30 0170  4    in the Ivy League. It even affects the faculty.
F30 0180  3       Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival- widely recognized
F30 0190  5    as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend
F30 0200  1    anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television
F30 0200 10    hookup, Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen
F30 0210  9    in rugged winter garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter
F30 0220  9    which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl.
F30 0230  6    President Dickey's golden retriever, frolicking in
F30 0240  3    the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine
F30 0250  1    informality.
F30 0250  2       This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up again
F30 0260  2    in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour,
F30 0260 10    wearing ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel
F30 0270  8    queen of the Carnival. She must have looked temptingly
F30 0280  6    pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head.
F30 0290  4    So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.
F30 0300  1       Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions
F30 0300  7    with equal sang-froid. For example, groups regularly
F30 0310  7    canoe down the Connecticut River. This is in honor
F30 0330  6    of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped a canoe
F30 0340  3    out of a handy tree and first set the course way back
F30 0340 15    in his own student days. And these hardy travelers
F30 0350  9    are not unappreciated today. They are hailed by the
F30 0360  7    nation's press, and Smith girls throng the riverbanks
F30 0370  3    at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup
F30 0380  3    and kisses.
F30 0380  5       Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation
F30 0390  2    is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand pairs
F30 0400  2    of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in
F30 0400 10    the United States, the students have stopped regarding
F30 0410  7    the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own.
F30 0420  7    Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate
F30 0430  5    Ski Union, which includes the winter sports colleges
F30 0440  3    of Canada as well as those of this country.
F30 0440 12       Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter, starting
F30 0450  7    with their own front door. They can hire a horse and
F30 0460  8    go ski-joring behind him, or move out to Oak Hill,
F30 0470  5    where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway, at Holt's
F30 0480  3    Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the
F30 0480 14    best terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.
F30 0490 10       Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's
F30 0500  8    own mountain. Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President
F30 0510  7    Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen
F30 0520  7    who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club
F30 0530  3    to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn
F30 0540  1    virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining,
F30 0540  9    sleeping, or lounging in its huge living room. The
F30 0550  8    Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and
F30 0560  5    several shelters, extending from the Vermont hills,
F30 0570  2    just across the river from the college, through Hanover
F30 0570 11    to the College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140
F30 0580  8    miles north up in the logging country. The cabins are
F30 0590  7    equipped with bunks, blankets, and cooking equipment
F30 0600  4    and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips. The
F30 0610  2    club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of
F30 0610 12    the students prefer to take off in small unofficial
F30 0620  8    groups for a weekend of hunting, fishing, climbing,
F30 0630  3    or skiing.
F30 0630  5       Under the auspices of the Outing Club, Dartmouth
F30 0640  3    also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes on tough
F30 0650  3    climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose
F30 0650 12    interests are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's
F30 0660  9    Team, which competes with other New England colleges
F30 0670  7    in wood sawing and chopping, canoe races, and the like.
F30 0690  6       There is much to be said for a college that, while
F30 0700  3    happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives
F30 0710  1    its students a chance to get up early in the morning
F30 0710 12    and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small
F30 0720  8    game, deer, or even bear is not uncommon. City boys
F30 0730  4    find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle
F30 0740  1    or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly
F30 0740 12    in a backwoods logging camp. And on the summit of Mount
F30 0750  9    Washington, where thirty-five degrees below zero is
F30 0760  5    commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher
F30 0770  2    than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of
F30 0770 13    wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the
F30 0780 11    Himalayas "because it is there".
F30 0790  4       There is much to be said for such a college- and
F30 0800  4    Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often
F30 0800 14    and too loudly. Their affection for their college home
F30 0810  8    has even caused President Dickey to comment on this
F30 0820  6    "place loyalty" as something rather specially Hanoverian.
F30 0830  3       Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time
F30 0840  3    in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in
F30 0840 13    the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was
F30 0850  9    casting about for a way to found its own state university.
F30 0860 10    It fixed on Dartmouth College, which was ready-made
F30 0870  5    and just what the proctor ordered. The legislators
F30 0880  2    decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a
F30 0880 10    tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control
F30 0890  8    of classrooms, faculty, and chapel. For a time there
F30 0900  7    were two factions on the campus fighting for possession
F30 0910  4    of the student body.
F30 0910  8       The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme
F30 0920  7    Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial
F30 0930  5    history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating
F30 0940  1    the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters.
F30 0940  9    A lawyer, hired by the college, was arguing specifically
F30 0950  8    for Dartmouth: Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made
F30 0960  7    her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea. In
F30 0970  6    an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, and
F30 0980  2    both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed
F30 0980 11    in manly tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering
F30 0990  8    climax:
F30 0990  9       "It is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and
F30 1000 11    yet there are those who love it ...".
F30 1010  5       Dartmouth is today still a small college- and still
F30 1020  5    a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.
F30 1020 12       This is not out of keeping with its origins, probably
F30 1030 10    the most humble of any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock,
F30 1040  8    a Presbyterian minister, founded the school in 1769,
F30 1050  6    naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, its sponsor
F30 1060  3    and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain,
F30 1070  1    found its great forests and remoteness good and with
F30 1070 10    his own hands built the first College Hall, a log hut
F30 1080  9    dedicated "for the education + instruction of Youth
F30 1090  5    of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing
F30 1100  2    + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary
F30 1100 11    and expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children
F30 1110  7    of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences;
F30 1120  8    and also of English Youth and any others".
F30 1130  4       It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's was indeed
F30 1140  3    "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to be
F30 1150  1    hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and
F30 1150  8    Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company
F30 1160  7    of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement
F30 1170  3    in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully
F30 1180  1    brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which
F30 1180  9    is still one of the cherished possessions of the college.
F30 1190  9       The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for
F30 1200  8    subsequent Dartmouth gatherings. A student orator "produced
F30 1210  5    tears from a great number of the learned" even before
F30 1220  3    the punch was served. Then from the branches of a near-by
F30 1230  3    tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform
F30 1230 11    and the English language, harangued the assemblage
F30 1240  7    in his aboriginal tongue. Governor Wentworth contributed
F30 1250  4    an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot
F30 1260  6    pines, and a barrel of rum was broached. The cook got
F30 1270  4    drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man of
F30 1280  2    broad talents by carving the ox himself.
F30 1280  9       Future commencements were more decorous perhaps,
F30 1290  5    but the number of graduates increased from the original
F30 1300  4    four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the nineteenth
F30 1310  1    century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and
F30 1310 10    Penn were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated
F30 1320  8    only sixty-nine. The dormitories, including the beloved
F30 1330  6    Dartmouth Hall, could barely house two hundred students
F30 1340  5    in Spartan fashion.
F30 1340  8       Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president
F30 1350  7    and the college's great awakening began. He transformed
F30 1360  6    Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into
F30 1370  4    a national college. By 1907 the number of undergraduates
F30 1380  2    had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in
F30 1390  1    that year, Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by
F30 1390 10    the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting
F30 1400  6    to the new stature of the college. The presidents of
F30 1410  5    Cornell, Wisconsin, C.C.N.Y., Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown,
F30 1420  4    Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard and the presidents
F30 1430  4    emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.
F30 1440  1       Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today,
F30 1440  9    with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates.
F30 1450  5    But it has achieved a cross-section of students from
F30 1460  6    almost all the states, and two-thirds of its undergraduates
F30 1470  3    come from outside New England. Over 450 different schools
F30 1480  2    are usually represented in each entering class. Only
F30 1480 10    a dozen or so schools send as many as six students,
F30 1490 10    and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single
F30 1500  7    delegation. About two-thirds of the boys now come from
F30 1510  5    public schools.
F30 1510  7       It is still a college only and not a university;
F30 1520  5    it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy group.
F30 1530  2    However, three distinguished associated graduate schools
F30 1530  8    offer professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical
F30 1540  6    School (third oldest in the country and founded in
F30 1550  7    1797), the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Amos
F30 1560  4    Tuck School of Business Administration. All three are
F30 1570  3    purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment
F30 1570 11    of about two hundred.
F30 1580  4       All three schools coordinate their educational programs
F30 1590  2    with that of the undergraduate college and, like the
F30 1590 11    college proper, place emphasis upon a broad liberal
F30 1600  7    arts course as the proper foundation for specialized
F30 1610  3    study. Students of the college who are candidates for
F30 1620  2    the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements
F30 1630  1    of the medical and business schools, may enter either
F30 1630 10    of these associated schools at the beginning of senior
F30 1640  7    year, thus completing the two-year postgraduate course
F30 1650  5    in one year. The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate
F30 1660  5    study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins a
F30 1670  2    B.S. in engineering.
F30 1670  5       So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the
F30 1680  6    Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member
F30 1690  1    of the League, if not in years at least in the catching
F30 1690 13    up it has had to do. It has not been a well-known school
F30 1700 12    for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed.
F30 1710  6    However much football has been over-emphasized, the
F30 1720  2    public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by
F30 1730  1    the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its
F30 1730 10    record a thought again since outscoring its opponents
F30 1740  5    694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth had to wait
F30 1750  4    until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition.
F30 1760  2       It has come on with a rush in more significant areas.
F30 1770  1    Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that
F30 1770 10    other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking.
F30 1780  5    But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even
F30 1790  5    in its educational attitudes, and, although some of
F30 1800  3    its experiments may still be in the testing stage,
F30 1800 12    they make for lively copy.
F30 1810  5       President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral
F30 1820  3    an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover.
