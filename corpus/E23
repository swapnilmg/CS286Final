E23 0010  1    ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose
E23 0010  9    style and direction has a kinship with the English
E23 0020  7    watercolorists of the early nineteenth century, especially
E23 0030  3    the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman.
E23 0040  2    And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects
E23 0050  1    in large, simplified masses which, though they seem
E23 0050  9    effortless, are in reality the result of skilled design
E23 0060  8    born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the
E23 0070  4    natural form that inspired them.
E23 0070  9       As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting
E23 0080 10    the goodness of the out-of-doors, its tang of weather,
E23 0090  8    its change of seasons, its variable moods. His father,
E23 0100  4    a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter,
E23 0110  2    took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and
E23 0110 10    imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature.
E23 0120  9    Out of this background of hunting and fishing, it was
E23 0130  6    only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew
E23 0140  3    best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream,
E23 0140 12    ducks and geese on the wing- almost always against
E23 0150  9    a vast backdrop of weather landscape. It is this subject
E23 0160  7    matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic
E23 0170  5    following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional
E23 0180  1    performance with this motif that commends him to artists
E23 0180 10    and discerning collectors.
E23 0190  3       Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself
E23 0200  2    exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to
E23 0200 11    work hard, long hours in a struggling family business
E23 0210  9    which, though it was allied to art of a kind- the design
E23 0220  9    and production of engraved seals- bore no relation
E23 0230  6    to the painting of pictures. But it did teach Roy the
E23 0240  3    basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for
E23 0240 11    twelve years, he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising
E23 0250  9    art studio in Philadelphia. On the death of their father,
E23 0260  7    they returned to their home in Batavia, New York. After
E23 0270  6    more years of concentrated effort, Roy and his brother
E23 0280  4    Max finally established a thriving family business
E23 0290  1    at the old stand.
E23 0290  5       During all this time Roy continued to paint, first
E23 0300  2    only on weekends, and then, as the family business
E23 0300 11    permitted, for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew
E23 0310  7    from the shop altogether, and for the past thirty years,
E23 0320  7    he has worked independently as a painter, except for
E23 0330  3    his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But
E23 0330 10    even on these, the palette often takes over while the
E23 0340 10    shotgun cools off!
E23 0350  1       Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey
E23 0350 10    Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction
E23 0360  8    he ever had- and this was limited to a few lessons,
E23 0370  8    though the two artists often went on painting trips
E23 0380  3    together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the
E23 0390  1    best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then
E23 0390 10    to draw with accuracy and assurance, and then to paint.
E23 0400  7    He worked in oil for years before beginning his work
E23 0410  4    in watercolor, and his first public recognition and
E23 0420  2    early honors, including his election to the Academy,
E23 0420 10    were for his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually
E23 0430  8    watercolor claimed his greater affection until today
E23 0440  4    it has become his major, if not exclusive, technique.
E23 0450  2       It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason
E23 0460  1    on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia.
E23 0460 10    More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave
E23 0470 10    my own work and stand at a respectable distance where
E23 0480  5    I could watch this man transform raw nature into a
E23 0490  3    composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed
E23 0500  1    time and time again is a process of integration, integration
E23 0500 11    that begins as abstract design and gradually takes
E23 0510  7    on recognizable form; color patterns that are made
E23 0520  5    to weave throughout the whole composition; and that
E23 0530  3    over-all, amazing control of large washes which is
E23 0530 12    the Mason stylemark. Finally come those little flicks
E23 0540  7    of a rigger brush and the job is done. Inspiring- yes;
E23 0550  6    instructive- maybe; duplicable- no!
E23 0560  4       But for the technical fact, we have the artist's
E23 0570  1    own testimony:
E23 0570  3       "Of late years, I find that I like best to work
E23 0580  2    out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches
E23 0580 11    in quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which
E23 0590  8    I pay particular attention to the design principles
E23 0600  5    of three simple values- the lightest light, the middle
E23 0610  4    tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms of
E23 0620  2    my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure
E23 0620 12    or wild life are to be part of the projected final
E23 0630  9    picture, I try to place them in the initial sketch.
E23 0640  5    For me, these will belong more completely to their
E23 0650  2    surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage,
E23 0650 11    though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add
E23 0660 11    or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves
E23 0670  7    my final purpose.
E23 0670 10       "I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors
E23 0680  5    suffer because the artist expects nature will do his
E23 0690  5    composing for him; as a result, such pictures are only
E23 0700  2    a literal translation of what the artist finds in the
E23 0700 12    scene before him. Just because a tree or other object
E23 0710  9    appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to
E23 0720  6    place it in the same position in the painting, unless
E23 0730  2    the position serves the design of the whole composition.
E23 0740  1    If the artist would study his work more thoroughly
E23 0740 10    and move certain units in his design, often only slightly,
E23 0750  8    finer pictures would result. Out of long experience
E23 0760  5    I have found that incidental figures and other objects
E23 0770  2    like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the
E23 0770 12    original sketch and moved about in the major areas
E23 0780  9    on the final sheet until they occupy the right position,
E23 0790  5    which I call 'clicking'.
E23 0800  1       "Speed in painting a picture is valid only when
E23 0800  9    it imparts spontaneity and crispness, but unless the
E23 0810  6    artist has lots of experience so that he can control
E23 0820  4    rapid execution, he would do well to take these first
E23 0820 14    sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve
E23 0830  8    a unified composition.
E23 0840  1       "If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of
E23 0840 10    the composition, I mean to project equal concern for
E23 0850  8    color. Often, in working out-of-doors under all conditions
E23 0860  7    of light and atmosphere, a particular passage that
E23 0870  3    looked favorable in relation to the subject will be
E23 0880  1    too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when
E23 0880 12    viewed indoors in a mat. When this occurs, I make the
E23 0890  9    change on the sketch or on the final watercolor- if
E23 0900  4    I have been working on a full sheet in the field.
E23 0910  1       "When working from one of my sketches I square it
E23 0910 11    up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor
E23 0920  9    sheet with charcoal. When this linear draft is completed,
E23 0930  7    I dust it down to a faint image. From this point, I
E23 0940  6    paint in as direct a manner as possible, by flowing
E23 0950  2    on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can
E23 0950 14    manage. However, first I thoughtfully study my sketch
E23 0965  6    for improvement of color and design along the lines
E23 0970  5    I have described. Then I plan my attack: the parts
E23 0980  3    I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting
E23 0980 13    of minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing
E23 0990  9    the finished job with a maximum of crispness. The longer
E23 1000  8    I work, the more I am sure that for me, at least, a
E23 1010  7    workmanlike method is important. Trial and error are
E23 1020  3    better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping
E23 1020 12    for miracles in the final painting.
E23 1030  5       "As for materials, I use the best available. I work
E23 1040  5    on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently
E23 1050  1    resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes
E23 1050 11    from undue strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top
E23 1060 11    table, but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move
E23 1070  7    it freely to control the washes. I have used a variety
E23 1080  4    of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English
E23 1090  1    make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting
E23 1090 10    a sheet and inspecting it for flaws (even the best
E23 1100  9    sometimes has foreign 'nubbins' on its surface), I
E23 1110  5    sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean, cold
E23 1120  3    water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so
E23 1120 13    that it will lie flat as a board.
E23 1130  8       "In addition to the usual tools, I make constant
E23 1140  4    use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes,
E23 1150  1    but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to
E23 1150 12    open up lights in dark washes. The great absorbency
E23 1160  7    of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control
E23 1170  6    than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist.
E23 1180  2    I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large
E23 1185  1    washes in the studio.
E23 1190  1       "My brushes are different from those used by most
E23 1200  3    watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle.
E23 1200 12    The red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and
E23 1210 11    a very large, flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch
E23 1220  9    @2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel
E23 1230  8    edge.
E23 1230  9       "My usual palette consists of top-quality colors:
E23 1240  6    alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna, raw umber, burnt
E23 1250  4    sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French ultramarine
E23 1260  2    blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow
E23 1270  1    pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's
E23 1270  9    gray, and ivory black".
E23 1280  4       In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, the first
E23 1290  3    thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness,
E23 1300  1    yet this word has such a varied connotation that it
E23 1300 11    needs some elaboration here. True, a Mason watercolor
E23 1310  6    is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a
E23 1320  6    detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns
E23 1330  1    that present a static flat convention, this artist's
E23 1330  9    pictures are full of atmosphere and climate.
E23 1340  7       Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape
E23 1350  5    can be reduced to three essential planes: a foreground
E23 1360  3    in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents
E23 1370  1    or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often
E23 1370 11    containing the major motif; and a background, usually
E23 1380  7    a silhouetted form foiled against the sky. In following
E23 1390  5    this general principle, Mason provides the observer
E23 1400  2    with a natural eye progression from foreground to background,
E23 1410  1    and the illusion of depth is instantly created.
E23 1410  9       When painting, Mason's physical eyes are half-closed,
E23 1420  7    while his mind's eye is wide open, and this circumstance
E23 1430  7    accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey.
E23 1440  5    He does not insist on telling all he knows about any
E23 1450  2    given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer
E23 1450 10    to draw on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia.
E23 1460  8    It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects
E23 1470  7    that require specific recognition of place for their
E23 1480  5    enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though they are
E23 1490  3    inspired by a particular locale; they universalize
E23 1490 10    in terms of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing
E23 1500  9    with common landscape in an uncommon way, Roy Mason
E23 1510  7    has found a particular niche in American landscape
E23 1520  2    art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience
E23 1530  1    of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive
E23 1530 11    interpretor, a breath and breadth of the outdoor world
E23 1540  9    to help man honor the Creator of it all.
E23 1550  6       The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, New York,
E23 1560  3    in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife
E23 1560 15    moved to California, he lived in western New York,
E23 1570  9    in Batavia. When I looked up the actual date of his
E23 1580  9    birth and found it to be March 15th, I realized that
E23 1590  5    Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist:
E23 1600  3    the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20). And
E23 1610  2    how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes,
E23 1610 13    and how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN
E23 1620  9    ARTIST again, in his natal month of March!
E23 1630  7       Over the years, beginning in 1929, Mason has been
E23 1640  5    awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals;
E23 1650  2    two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell
E23 1660  1    Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes;
E23 1660  8    the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute
E23 1670  7    of Chicago; and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua,
E23 1680  8    New Haven, Rochester, Rockport, and most recently,
E23 1690  5    the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach
E23 1700  4    Art Association,
E23 1700  6       He was elected to the National Academy of Design
E23 1710  4    as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 (after receiving
E23 1720  3    his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy
E23 1730  1    in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940.
E23 1730  9    Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society,
E23 1740  6    Philadelphia Water Color Club, Allied Artists of America,
E23 1750  7    Audubon Artists, Baltimore Watercolor Society.
