L11 0010  1       "Right", said the fingerprint man. "Also, if you're
L11 0010  9    going to believe those prints, you'll have to look
L11 0020  9    for a killer who's a top-grade piano player".
L11 0030  6       He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano, doing
L11 0040  4    a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack.
L11 0050  1    To make it clearer he shifted to acting out, but with
L11 0050 12    no change of manner, the killing of Rose Mallory. His
L11 0060  9    hands snatched at an imaginary bucket, swooping down
L11 0070  5    hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like
L11 0080  3    a ball that's been bounced hard. In the same way he
L11 0090  1    pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off
L11 0090  9    that, pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing
L11 0100  7    cleanly off that. He was moving like a ballet dancer,
L11 0110  5    playing for laughs. If Rose Mallory's killer acted
L11 0120  2    this way, catching up with him was going to be a cinch.
L11 0120 14    We'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers
L11 0130 10    he'd wear twined in his hair.
L11 0140  4       Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this
L11 0150  1    boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall
L11 0150 12    outside the murdered woman's apartment, we might have
L11 0160  6    had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness.
L11 0170  4    This, you will remember, was still New Year's Day.
L11 0190  2    By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon,
L11 0190 12    which, one would think, would be late enough so that
L11 0200  9    by then, except for small children and a few hardy
L11 0210  5    souls who had not yet sobered up, it could have been
L11 0220  2    expected that people would no longer be having any
L11 0220 11    sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers
L11 0230  7    and paper hats.
L11 0240  1       Felix was the exception. He had retained his hat
L11 0240 10    and his horn, and, whatever fun might still be going,
L11 0250  7    he was ready to join it. That, incidentally, might
L11 0260  2    give you some idea of what Felix was like. After all,
L11 0270  2    he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall
L11 0270 12    without warning.
L11 0280  1       The ME's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination
L11 0290  1    and the body had been removed for autopsy. The meat
L11 0290 11    wagon, therefore, was not out in front of the house
L11 0300  9    any more, but the cluster of squad cars was still there
L11 0310  7    and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen
L11 0320  3    any comings and goings. There was, furthermore, the
L11 0330  1    crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and
L11 0330 10    a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance.
L11 0340  8       Just put yourself in Felix's place for a moment.
L11 0350  5    You're a taxpayer, householder, landlord. You've been
L11 0360  3    away from home for the New Year festivities, but now
L11 0370  1    the party is over and you come home. Defining sobriety
L11 0370 11    in the limited sense of being free from the clinical
L11 0380  8    symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not
L11 0390  4    yet eliminated from the system, you are sober.
L11 0400  1       You still have your paper hat and you're wearing
L11 0400 10    it, but then, it is an extraordinary paper hat and,
L11 0410  8    in addition to anything else you may be, you are also
L11 0420  7    the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out
L11 0430  2    in the back yard. It's not too much to assume that
L11 0430 13    you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats
L11 0440  9    than will Mr. Average Citizen.
L11 0450  2       You have your paper horn clutched in your big, craggy
L11 0460  1    fist, and for your entrance you have planned a noisy,
L11 0460 11    colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and
L11 0470  6    tenants. You find your house a focus of public and
L11 0480  5    police attention. Can you imagine yourself forgetting
L11 0490  1    under the circumstances that you are approaching this
L11 0490  9    startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted
L11 0500  6    and armed with a paper horn?
L11 0510  1       Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness.
L11 0510  8    You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious
L11 0520  9    and you barge up to the cop on the door. You identify
L11 0540  7    yourself and ask him what's going on. Instead of answering
L11 0550  5    you, he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the
L11 0560  3    stairs.
L11 0560  4       "Got the upstairs guy", he bellows. "The owner.
L11 0570  2    Do I send him up"? Then he turns back to you. "Go on
L11 0580  2    in", he says. "They'll tell you what's cooking".
L11 0590  1       Even then, as you go into the house oppressed by
L11 0590 10    the knowledge that something is cooking and that your
L11 0600  7    house has passed under this unaccountable, official
L11 0610  2    control, could you go on forgetting that you still
L11 0610 11    had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still
L11 0620 11    carrying that childish horn in your hand?
L11 0630  5       What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared
L11 0640  4    for Felix's being an odd one. We'd seen his handiwork
L11 0650  2    out in the back yard, and the little his tenants had
L11 0650 13    told us of him did make him sound a little special.
L11 0660 10    We were not, however, prepared for anything like the
L11 0670  5    apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the
L11 0680  3    stairs. He, of course, must have been equally unprepared
L11 0680 12    for what confronted him, but, nonetheless, I did find
L11 0690  9    his reaction startling.
L11 0700  1       If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying
L11 0700 10    the horn because he'd forgotten about them, he now
L11 0710  8    remembered. He came bounding up the stairs and joined
L11 0720  6    the dance. He adjusted the hat, lifted the horn to
L11 0730  4    his lips as though it were a flute, and fell in alongside
L11 0740  1    our fingerprint expert to cavort with him.
L11 0740  8       Our man stopped dead and glowered at Felix. Felix
L11 0750  7    threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook
L11 0760  4    the timbers of even that solidly built old house. This
L11 0770  1    was a bull of a man. He was big-chested, big-shouldered
L11 0770 13    and heavy-armed. His face was ruddy and heavy and unlined,
L11 0780  9    and when he laughed he showed his teeth, which were
L11 0790  7    big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown.
L11 0800  3    I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite
L11 0810  1    so white and at the same time quite so emphatically
L11 0810 11    not dentures. His hair had receded most of the way
L11 0820  8    to the back of his neck. He had only a fringe of hair
L11 0830  5    and he wore it cropped short. It was almost as white
L11 0840  1    as his teeth. For a man of his mass he was curiously
L11 0840 13    short. He wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic
L11 0850 12    figure. A man with so big and so staggeringly developed
L11 0860  5    a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected
L11 0870  3    to stand taller than five feet five. For Felix it was
L11 0880  1    a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement. The
L11 0880 12    man was just this side of being a freak.
L11 0890  6       We waited till he had finished laughing, and that
L11 0900  3    gave us a few moments for taking stock of him. He was
L11 0900 15    dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor
L11 0910 10    man's country weekend. Dark gray sports jacket, lighter
L11 0920  8    gray slacks, pink flannel shirt, black silk necktie.
L11 0930  5    His eyes were clear. He was freshly shaved, and if
L11 0940  4    there had been any alcohol in him we could never have
L11 0950  1    missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts
L11 0950 11    of his laughter. Not even a whiff. Eventually he subsided.
L11 0960  8       "Felix"? Gibby said.
L11 0970  3       "Me", he said merrily. "Me, the happy one".
L11 0980  1       "That much Latin we remember", Gibby said dryly.
L11 0980  9    "You always live up to your name, always like this,
L11 0990 10    always making happy"?
L11 1000  1       "I try", Felix said blithely. "The world is full
L11 1010  1    of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic
L11 1010 11    scene. I've never noticed that it improves things any".
L11 1020  8       "Bully for you", Gibby said. "What's the rest of
L11 1030  7    your name"?
L11 1040  1       "No rest of it. Felix is all there is".
L11 1040  9       "All there ever was"?
L11 1050  2       "The past I leave to historians", Felix intoned,
L11 1060  1    demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy.
L11 1060 11       "You live in the present"?
L11 1070  5       "In the present", Felix proclaimed. "For the future.
L11 1080  4    Is there any other time in which a man can live"?
L11 1090  3       "We", Gibby announced, "are not philosophers. We
L11 1100  2    are Assistant District Attorneys. This gentleman is
L11 1100  9    a police officer. He is a fingerprint specialist. Could
L11 1110  8    your future, your immediate future, be made to include
L11 1120  7    taking us upstairs, giving us a bit of space in which
L11 1130  6    our friend can work, and making available to him your
L11 1140  2    finger tips"?
L11 1140  4       The happy one could never have looked happier. This
L11 1150  3    was more than joy. It was ecstasy.
L11 1150 10       "Those lovely whorls", he chortled. "So intricate,
L11 1160  6    so beautiful. Come right along. I love fingerprints".
L11 1170  5       He was prancing along the hall, heading for the
L11 1180  5    next flight of stairs.
L11 1180  9       Gibby called him back. "We're here because of what
L11 1190  7    happened last night", he said. "Past, yes, but important.
L11 1200  5    Since it is important, for the record let's have the
L11 1210  4    full name".
L11 1210  6       "That important"? Felix asked.
L11 1220  2       "That important".
L11 1220  4       "Grubb", Felix whispered.
L11 1230  1       "Felix Grubb"? Gibby asked, not bothering to whisper.
L11 1240  1       "Shh", Felix implored. "I can't see what would make
L11 1250  2    it necessary for you to know. Nothing could make it
L11 1250 12    necessary to proclaim it to the whole world".
L11 1260  8       Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice. "Felix Grubb"?
L11 1270  5    he repeated. "No. Edmund, but not for years. For years
L11 1280  6    it's been just Felix. First thing I did after my twenty-first
L11 1290  5    birthday was go into court and have it officially changed,
L11 1300  2    and this is something I don't tell everybody. That
L11 1300 11    was almost forty years ago".
L11 1310  5       Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty,
L11 1320  4    he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered
L11 1330  1    the number less credible. This was a broth of a boy,
L11 1330 12    our Felix, and nothing was more obvious than the joy
L11 1340  8    he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full
L11 1350  6    of juice and spirit. We followed him up the stairs.
L11 1360  2    The cops would gather up Connor and the foursome on
L11 1360 12    the third floor and bring us those of them who would
L11 1370 10    voluntarily submit to fingerprinting.
L11 1380  1       You may think we didn't need Nancy and Jean, but
L11 1390  2    you always get what you can when you can, and we had
L11 1390 14    no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't
L11 1400  8    be useful before we were through with this case. Also,
L11 1410  6    if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that
L11 1420  4    extent let the whole world know at least that much
L11 1420 14    of where we stood. The killer, if in our present group,
L11 1430 10    would certainly be interested in knowing that much,
L11 1440  6    and even though with the fingerprint evidence what
L11 1450  3    it was I could see no way he could use this bit of
L11 1450 16    information to improve on his situation, there might
L11 1460  8    always be some way. If you can possibly avoid it, you
L11 1470  7    don't hand out any extra chances.
L11 1480  1       Felix took us into his studio. It was that oddly
L11 1480 11    shaped space at the very top of the house, where ceiling
L11 1490 10    heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying
L11 1500  5    angles of roof slope. At each angle of its pitch a
L11 1510  3    big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all
L11 1510 13    these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple
L11 1520  7    screens and shades.
L11 1530  1       When Felix first opened the door on it, all these
L11 1530 10    shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was
L11 1540  7    as dark as night. He quickly fixed that, rolling back
L11 1550  4    the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens
L11 1560  1    on the others. He flew about the place making these
L11 1560 11    adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing
L11 1570 10    was the fruit of long experience. None of his movements
L11 1580  5    was tentative. There was no process of trial and error.
L11 1590  4    Starting with the room completely blacked out, as it
L11 1600  1    was when we came in, he unerringly fixed things so
L11 1600 11    that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light
L11 1610  8    without at any point admitting even so much as a crack
L11 1620  7    of glare.
L11 1620  9       Expecting something more-than-average wacky, I was
L11 1630  4    surprised by what we found. There was no display of
L11 1640  2    either works in progress or of finished work. Here
L11 1640 11    and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with
L11 1650  9    a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it. These shapes
L11 1660  5    might have been mad, but there was no telling. They
L11 1670  2    were all completely shrouded. The equipment was solid
L11 1670 10    and heavy and in good condition. Everything was orderly
L11 1690  8    and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort,
L11 1700  6    convenience and efficiency. There were tools about
L11 1710  4    but they were neatly kept. There was no confusion and
L11 1720  2    no litter. Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked
L11 1720 11    in bins.
