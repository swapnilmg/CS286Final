J22 0010  1       These societies can expect to face difficult times.
J22 0010  9    As the historic processes of modernization gradually
J22 0020  5    gain momentum, their cohesion will be threatened by
J22 0030  5    divisive forces, the gaps between rulers and subjects,
J22 0040  2    town and country, will widen; new aspirants for power
J22 0040 11    will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence;
J22 0050  8    old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of
J22 0060  8    direction. National leaders will have to display the
J22 0070  5    highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people
J22 0080  1    through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy
J22 0080  9    men's sense of identity. Feelings of a community of
J22 0090  9    interest will have to be recreated- in some of the
J22 0100  7    new nations, indeed, they must be built for the first
J22 0110  4    time- on a new basis which looks toward the future
J22 0110 14    and does not rely only on shared memories of the past.
J22 0120 11    Nevertheless, with foresight and careful planning,
J22 0130  5    some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences
J22 0140  2    of social change which have troubled other countries
J22 0150  1    passing through this stage can be escaped. The United
J22 0150 10    States can help by communicating a genuine concern
J22 0160  7    with the problems these countries face and a readiness
J22 0170  5    to provide technical and other appropriate forms of
J22 0180  2    assistance where possible.
J22 0180  5       Our central goal should be to provide the greatest
J22 0190  5    positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly
J22 0200  2    the tasks which they face. At the same time, we should
J22 0200 13    recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack
J22 0210  9    of cohesion and stability which characterize these
J22 0220  4    countries may make them particularly prone to diversions
J22 0230  3    and external adventures of all sorts. It may seem to
J22 0230 13    some of them that success can be purchased much less
J22 0240 10    dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international
J22 0250  5    politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks
J22 0260  2    at home. We should do what we can to discourage this
J22 0260 13    conclusion, both by offering assistance for their domestic
J22 0270  8    needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions
J22 0280  5    on the world scene. When necessary, we should make
J22 0290  4    it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal
J22 0300  1    advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential
J22 0300 11    for disrupting the security of the world will not only
J22 0310 10    lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects
J22 0320  6    for orderly development. As a nation, we feel an obligation
J22 0330  5    to assist other countries in their development; but
J22 0340  2    this obligation pertains only to countries which are
J22 0340 10    honestly seeking to become responsible members of a
J22 0350  8    stable and forward-moving world community.
J22 0360  1    #TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES#
J22 0360  3    When we look at countries like Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,
J22 0370  4    and Burma, where substantial progress has been made
J22 0380  1    in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social
J22 0380 12    overhead capital, and where institutions of centralized
J22 0390  6    government exist, we find a second category of countries
J22 0400  6    with a different set of problems and hence different
J22 0410  2    priorities for policy. The men in power are committed
J22 0420  1    in principle to modernization, but economic and social
J22 0420  9    changes are proceeding only erratically. Isolated enterprises
J22 0430  5    have been launched, but they are not yet related to
J22 0440  7    each other in a meaningful pattern. The society is
J22 0450  3    likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized
J22 0450 12    urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector,
J22 0460  8    with very poor communications between the two. Progress
J22 0470  5    is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective
J22 0480  3    action among those in power and by a failure on their
J22 0490  2    part to understand how local resources, human and material,
J22 0490 11    can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization
J22 0500 10    already symbolically accepted.
J22 0510  2       Most countries in this second category share the
J22 0520  2    difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern
J22 0520 12    political and social system without the modern standards
J22 0530  8    of performance required to make them effective. In
J22 0540  6    these rapidly changing societies there is also too
J22 0550  4    little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve
J22 0550 13    goals. The colonial period has generally left people
J22 0560  8    believing that government can, if it wishes, provide
J22 0570  6    all manner of services for them- and that with independence
J22 0580  5    free men do not have to work to realize the benefits
J22 0590  2    of modern life. For example, in accordance with the
J22 0590 11    fashion of the times, most transitional societies have
J22 0600  8    announced economic development plans of varying numbers
J22 0610  5    of years; such is the mystique of planning that people
J22 0620  4    expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically
J22 0630  2    upon its announcement. The civil services in such societies
J22 0640  1    are generally inadequate to deal competently with the
J22 0640  9    problems facing them; and their members often equate
J22 0650  7    a government career with security and status rather
J22 0660  4    than with sacrifice, self-discipline, and competence.
J22 0670  1       American policy should press constantly the view
J22 0670  8    that until these governments demand efficiency and
J22 0680  7    effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the
J22 0690  6    slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize
J22 0700  3    their societies. We should spread the view that planning
J22 0710  2    and national development are serious matters which
J22 0710  9    call for effort as well as enthusiasm. Above all, we
J22 0720  9    should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies
J22 0730  6    to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible
J22 0740  3    for their fates. Only within the framework of a mature
J22 0750  1    relationship characterized by honest appraisals of
J22 0750  7    performance can we provide telling assistance. With
J22 0760  6    respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to
J22 0770  4    live with their illusions, we can afford to wait, for
J22 0780  2    in time their comparative lack of progress will become
J22 0780 11    clear for all to see.
J22 0790  3       Our technical assistance to these countries should
J22 0800  1    place special emphasis on inducing the central governments
J22 0800  9    to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an
J22 0810  9    earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with
J22 0830  5    the central governments. We should encourage the governments
J22 0840  3    to develop their own technical assistance to communities,
J22 0850  1    state and provincial governments, rural communities,
J22 0850  7    and other smaller groups, making certain that no important
J22 0860  7    segment of the economy is neglected. Simultaneously
J22 0870  3    we should be underlining the interrelationships of
J22 0880  2    technical progress in various fields, showing how agricultural
J22 0890  1    training can be introduced into education, how health
J22 0890  9    affects labor productivity, how small business can
J22 0900  6    benefit the rural farm community, and, above all, how
J22 0910  5    progress in each field relates to national progress.
J22 0920  1    Efforts such as the Community Development Program in
J22 0920  9    the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional
J22 0930  5    societies can work toward balanced national development.
J22 0940  4    To achieve this goal of balanced development, communications
J22 0950  2    between the central government and the local communities
J22 0960  1    must be such that the needs and aspirations of the
J22 0960 11    people themselves are effectively taken into account.
J22 0970  6    If modernization programs are imposed from above, without
J22 0980  6    the understanding and cooperation of the people, they
J22 0990  4    will encounter grave difficulties.
J22 0990  8       Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in
J22 1000  9    many of these countries. It should be American policy
J22 1010  4    not only to encourage effective land reform programs
J22 1020  2    but also to underline the relation of such reforms
J22 1020 11    to the economic growth and modernization of the society.
J22 1030  7    As an isolated policy, land reform is likely to be
J22 1040  7    politically disruptive; as part of a larger development
J22 1050  2    effort, however, it may gain wide acceptance. It should
J22 1060  1    also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy
J22 1060 10    cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone. Land
J22 1070  6    reform programs need to be supplemented with programs
J22 1080  4    for promoting rural credits and technical assistance
J22 1090  1    in agriculture.
J22 1090  3       Lastly, governmental and private planners will at
J22 1100  3    this stage begin to see large capital requirements
J22 1100 11    looming ahead. By holding out prospects for external
J22 1110  8    capital assistance, the United States can provide strong
J22 1120  6    incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive
J22 1130  3    necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth.
J22 1140  1    #ACTIVELY MODERNIZING SOCIETIES#
J22 1140  3    At a third stage in the modernization process are such
J22 1150  4    countries as India, Brazil, the Philippines, and Taiwan,
J22 1160  2    which are ready and committed to move into the stage
J22 1160 12    of self-sustaining growth. They must continue to satisfy
J22 1170  7    basic capital needs; and there persists the dual problem
J22 1180  7    of maintaining operational unity around a national
J22 1190  4    program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing
J22 1200  1    participation in the program to wider and wider groups.
J22 1210  1    But these countries have made big strides toward developing
J22 1210 10    the necessary human and social overhead capital; they
J22 1220  7    have established reasonably stable and effective governmental
J22 1230  5    institutions at national and local levels; and they
J22 1240  4    have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically
J22 1250  1    and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their
J22 1250 10    economies.
J22 1260  1       On the economic front, the first priority of these
J22 1260 10    countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume
J22 1270  8    of resources. Several related tasks must be carried
J22 1280  5    out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved. These
J22 1290  2    countries must formulate a comprehensive, long-term
J22 1290  9    program covering the objectives of both the private
J22 1300  8    and the public sectors of the economy. They must in
J22 1310  7    their planning be able to count on at least tentative
J22 1330  2    commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods
J22 1340  1    of several years. Capital imports drawn from a number
J22 1340 10    of sources must be employed and combined skillfully
J22 1350  6    enough to permit domestic investment programming to
J22 1360  3    go forward. Capital flows must be coordinated with
J22 1370  1    national needs and planning. Finally, a balance must
J22 1370  9    be effected among project finance, utilization of agricultural
J22 1390  6    surpluses, and general balance of payments support.
J22 1400  5       Thus, although the agenda of external assistance
J22 1410  2    in the economic sphere are cumulative, and many of
J22 1410 11    the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages
J22 1420  9    remain relevant, the basic purpose of American economic
J22 1430  7    policy during the later stages of development should
J22 1440  4    be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining
J22 1450  1    growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.
J22 1460  1       There remain many political and administrative problems
J22 1460  8    to be solved. For one thing, although considerable
J22 1470  6    numbers of men have been trained, bureaucracies are
J22 1480  3    still deficient in many respects; even the famed Indian
J22 1490  3    Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous
J22 1500  1    range of tasks it has undertaken. Technical assistance
J22 1500  9    in training middle- and upper-level management personnel
J22 1510  6    is still needed in many cases. There are also more
J22 1520  5    basic problems. This is the stage at which democratic
J22 1530  1    developments must take place if the society is to become
J22 1530 11    an open community of creative people. Nevertheless,
J22 1540  7    impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize
J22 1550  7    and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and
J22 1560  4    authoritarian practices. Another great danger is that
J22 1570  2    the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly
J22 1570 10    alienated from the political leaders who still justify
J22 1580  8    their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence
J22 1590  6    or the early phase of nationalism. The capacity of
J22 1600  4    intellectuals and members of the new professional classes
J22 1610  2    to contribute creatively to national development is
J22 1610  9    likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority
J22 1620  9    toward both their own political class and their colleagues
J22 1630  7    and professional counterparts in the West. Particularly
J22 1640  5    when based upon a single dominant party, governments
J22 1650  2    may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly
J22 1650 12    of understanding about the national interest. Convinced
J22 1660  7    of the wisdom of their own actions, and reassured by
J22 1670  7    the promises of their economic development programs,
J22 1680  2    governments may fail to push outward to win more and
J22 1690  2    more people to the national effort, becoming instead
J22 1690 10    more rigid and inflexible in their policies.
J22 1700  5       American policy toward such societies should stress
J22 1710  3    our sympathy for the emerging social and professional
J22 1720  1    classes. It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation
J22 1730  1    of professional standards and an understanding of the
J22 1730  9    tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open
J22 1740  6    and pluralistic societies. We have every obligation
J22 1750  4    to take seriously their claims to being democratic
J22 1760  1    and free countries; we also have, in consequence, the
J22 1760 10    duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance
J22 1770  6    and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in
J22 1780  7    frank but friendly ways.
J22 1780 11    #THE TIME FACTOR#
J22 1790  2    We have emphasized that the modernizing process in
J22 1790 10    each society will take a considerable period of time.
J22 1800  8    With the exception of treaty-making, foreign relations
J22 1810  5    were historically concerned for the most part with
J22 1820  4    conditions of short or at least measurable duration.
J22 1820 12    Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective
J22 1830  8    and must become skilled not merely at response but
J22 1840  6    also at projection. American and free-world policies
J22 1850  2    can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically
J22 1860  1    that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources
J22 1860 11    and in the human attitudes, political institutions,
J22 1870  6    and social structure which each society must generate.
J22 1880  5    It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped
J22 1890  3    countries must have a realistically long working horizon.
J22 1900  2    It must be marked by a patience and persistence which
J22 1900 12    have not always been its trademark.
J22 1910  6       This condition affects not only the conception but
J22 1920  4    also the legislative and financial support of foreign
J22 1930  1    policy, especially in the context of economic aid.
