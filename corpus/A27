A27 0010  1    _SANTA BARBARA_
A27 0010  3       - "The present recovery movement will gather steady
A27 0020  1    momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak
A27 0020 11    by this autumn", Beryl W. Sprinkel, economist of Harris
A27 0030  7    Trust + Savings Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing
A27 0040  7    session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn., California
A27 0050  4    group, conference.
A27 0050  6       Another speaker, William H. Draper, Jr., former
A27 0060  7    Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto
A27 0070 10    venture capital firm of Draper, Gaither + Anderson,
A27 0080  4    urged the U.S. to "throw down the gauntlet of battle
A27 0090  4    to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed
A27 0100  2    arouny any more". He urged support for President Kennedy's
A27 0110  1    requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations.
A27 0110  9    #'NOT FLASH IN PAN'#
A27 0120  4    Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement
A27 0130  1    in economic activity was not a "temporary flash in
A27 0130 10    the pan" but the beginning of a substantial cyclical
A27 0140  8    expansion that will carry the economy back to full
A27 0150  6    employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional
A27 0160  2    growth pattern.
A27 0160  4       "In view of the current expansion, which promises
A27 0170  3    to be substantial" he said the odds appear to favor
A27 0180  1    rising interest rates in coming months, but "there
A27 0180  9    is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt
A27 0190  9    as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960".
A27 0200  6    #THESIS REFUTED#
A27 0200  8    Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist
A27 0210  5    thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow
A27 0220  4    growth, declaring that this pessimism "is based on
A27 0230  1    very limited and questionable evidence".
A27 0230  6       Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60
A27 0240  7    as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for
A27 0250  3    growth", he said "it should be viewed as a lesson well
A27 0260  2    learned which will increase the probability of substantial
A27 0260 10    improvement in this recovery".
A27 0270  4    #DANGER CITED#
A27 0270  6    He cautioned that "the greater danger in this recovery
A27 0280  6    may be excessive stimulation by government which could
A27 0290  3    bring moderate inflation".
A27 0290  6       The economist does not look for a drastic switch
A27 0300  8    in the budget during this recovery and believes it
A27 0310  4    "even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively
A27 0320  2    tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the
A27 0320 11    upturn as was the case in 1958".
A27 0330  7       The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion, he said, was
A27 0340  4    not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our
A27 0350  1    economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate
A27 0350 10    economic policies combined with retrenching decisions
A27 0360  5    resulting from the steel strike.
A27 0370  1    #SACRIFICES NEEDED#
A27 0370  3    Draper declared, "As I see it, this country has never
A27 0380  4    faced such great dangers as threaten us today. We must
A27 0390  2    justify our heritage. We must be ready for any needed
A27 0390 12    sacrifice".
A27 0400  1       He said that from his experience of two years with
A27 0400 11    Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration, that "Russia
A27 0410  8    respects our show of strength, but that presently we're
A27 0420  7    not acting as we should and must".
A27 0430  2       He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail
A27 0440  1    action, and noted that in war "you can't buy yourself
A27 0440 11    out and that's what we're trying to do".
A27 0450  7       While he declined to suggest, how, he said that
A27 0460  5    sooner or later we must get rid of Castro, "for unless
A27 0470  3    we do we're liable to face similar situations in this
A27 0480  1    hemisphere. Its the start of a direct threat to our
A27 0480 11    own security and I don't believe we can permit that".
A27 0500  1    _NEW YORK (AP)_
A27 0500  4       - Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery,
A27 0510  2    erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press
A27 0520  1    average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.
A27 0520 11       Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery
A27 0530 10    drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when
A27 0540  6    the list sank to a hoped-for "support level" represented
A27 0550  3    by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average.
A27 0560  2    It was a level at which some of the investors standing
A27 0560 13    on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal
A27 0570 10    issues represented in the averages.
A27 0580  4    #SOME GOOD NEWS#
A27 0580  7    Although it looked like a routine technical snapback
A27 0590  3    to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news.
A27 0610  3    A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable
A27 0610 13    goods was reported for last month.
A27 0620  6       Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy
A27 0630  4    is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year,
A27 0640  2    paving the way for lower taxes.
A27 0640  8       The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to
A27 0650  5    687.87.
A27 0650  6       Of 1,253 issues traded, 695 advanced and 354 declined.
A27 0660  5    New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14.
A27 0670  4       Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.
A27 0680  1    Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million
A27 0680 10    Monday.
A27 0690  1       A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion
A27 0690 10    economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by
A27 0700  8    Peter G. Peterson, head of one of the world's greatest
A27 0710  7    camera firms, in a key address before the American
A27 0720  3    Marketing Assn.
A27 0720  5       However, Peterson, president of Bell + Howell, warned
A27 0730  6    800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference
A27 0740  4    at the Ambassador, that the future will belong to the
A27 0750  4    industrialist of creative and "unconventional wisdom".
A27 0760  1    #CREATION'S NEEDED#
A27 0760  3    "As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted
A27 0770  4    for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer
A27 0780  1    expenditures that will be required to reach that goal,
A27 0780 10    management can well be restless about how this tremendous
A27 0790  9    volume and number of new products will be created and
A27 0800  6    marketed", Peterson said.
A27 0810  1       "With this kind of new product log-jam, the premium
A27 0810 10    for brilliant product planning will obviously go up
A27 0820  6    geometrically".
A27 0820  7       The executive paid tribute to research and development
A27 0830  7    and technology for their great contributions in the
A27 0840  5    past, but he also cautioned industry that they tend
A27 0850  3    to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly
A27 0850 13    even pace within an industry and fail to give it the
A27 0860 10    short-term advantage which it often needs.
A27 0870  4    #NOTHING TO FEAR#
A27 0870  7    Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world
A27 0880  5    competition if it dares to be original in both marketing
A27 0890  2    and product ideas. He cited, as an example, how the
A27 0890 12    American camera industry has been able to meet successfully
A27 0900  9    the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor
A27 0910  7    costs, by improving its production know-how and technology.
A27 0920  5       He also used as an example the manufacturer who
A27 0930  3    introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with
A27 0940  1    the result that it became the best selling camera in
A27 0940 11    the German market.
A27 0960  1       Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific
A27 0960 10    Coast Stock Exchange, effective Tuesday, has been announced
A27 0970  8    by Thomas P. Phelan, president of the exchange.
A27 0980  7       Taylor, president and voting stockholder of Taylor
A27 0990  6    and Co., Beverly Hills, has been active in the securities
A27 1000  5    business since 1925.
A27 1010  1       Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120
A27 1010  9    million in debentures to the public through a group
A27 1020  9    of underwriters headed by Dillon, Read + Co., to raise
A27 1030  7    money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp.
A27 1040  5       Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877
A27 1050  3    shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures
A27 1060  2    plus cash, according to Union. Under the new offering,
A27 1060 11    only $60 million in debentures are convertible into
A27 1070  8    923,076 common shares.
A27 1080  1    #DUE IN 1986#
A27 1080  4    The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth
A27 1090  2    of 4-7/8 debentures, due June 1, 1986, at 100%, and
A27 1090 13    $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures
A27 1100  8    due June 1, 1991, at 100%. The convertible debentures
A27 1110  6    are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by
A27 1120  7    June 1, 1966; $70 by 1971; $75 by 1976; $80 by 1981;
A27 1130  4    $85 by 1986, and $90 thereafter.
A27 1140  1    _NEW YORK(AP)_
A27 1140  3       - American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly
A27 1150  1    solid rise but here also trading dwindled. Volume was
A27 1150 10    1.23 million shares, down from Monday's 1.58 million.
A27 1160  7    Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic
A27 1170  5    Foil. Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained
A27 1180  3    2-1/2 each.
A27 1190  1    _QUESTION_
A27 1190  1       - I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock
A27 1190  9    Fund on Oct. 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same
A27 1200 12    mutual fund on Feb. 8, 1960. Something has gone wrong
A27 1210  8    some place. I am getting dividends on only 50 shares.
A27 1220  6    In other words, I am getting only half the dividends
A27 1230  3    I should.
A27 1230  5    _ANSWER_
A27 1230  6       - Write to the fund's custodian bank- the First
A27 1240  3    National Bank of Jersey City, N.J. That bank handles
A27 1250  4    most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock
A27 1260  1    Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment
A27 1260  6    Fund and Television-Electronics Fund.
A27 1270  4       The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data
A27 1280  4    processing system to handle things. But it seems that
A27 1290  2    this "electronic brain" wasn't "programmed" correctly.
A27 1300  1       This resulted in a great number of errors. And letters
A27 1300 11    began to come in to this column from irate shareholders.
A27 1310 10       I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about
A27 1320 10    the situation. At that time, the people at the bank
A27 1330  6    said they felt that they had the situation in hand.
A27 1340  3    They indicated that no new errors were being made and
A27 1340 13    that all old errors would be corrected "within 60 days".
A27 1350  4       That 60-day period is over and letters are still
A27 1360  8    coming in from shareholders of these four funds, complaining
A27 1370  5    about mistakes in their accounts.
A27 1380  1       Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away
A27 1380  9    than the bankers expected. Any shareholder of any of
A27 1390  7    these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly
A27 1400  5    should get in touch with the bank.
A27 1410  1       Doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries. He
A27 1410  8    selects queries or general interest to answer.
A27 1430  1    _WASHINGTON (AP)_
A27 1430  3       - Alfred Hayes, president of the Federal Reserve
A27 1440  2    Bank of New York, said Tuesday "there is no present
A27 1440 12    need for far-reaching reforms" which would basically
A27 1450  8    alter the international financial system.
A27 1460  3       Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively
A27 1470  4    with short-term capital movements between nations,
A27 1480  1    "there is no reason, in my judgment why the international
A27 1480 11    financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at
A27 1490  7    least the foreseeable future".
A27 1510  1    _WASHINGTON (UPI)_
A27 1510  3       - New York Central Railroad president Alfred E.
A27 1520  2    Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat
A27 1520 11    of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore
A27 1530  9    + Ohio Railroads merge.
A27 1540  2       Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate
A27 1540 10    effect of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate
A27 1550 10    effect.
A27 1550 11       The railroad president made the statement in an
A27 1560  8    interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened
A27 1570  4    Round 2 of its hearing into the C+O's request to
A27 1580  3    control and then merge with the B+O.
A27 1590  1       "All these kind of things weaken us", Perlman said.
A27 1590 10    #BAD CONDITION#
A27 1600  2    Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio
A27 1610  1    Railroad Co., testified the B+O was in its worst
A27 1610 10    financial condition since the depression years and
A27 1620  7    badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation
A27 1630  7    with the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad.
A27 1640  1       "The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio,
A27 1650  1    has become precarious- much worse than at any time
A27 1650 10    since the depression of the 1930s", he told the hearing.
A27 1660  8       C+O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back
A27 1670  7    for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys
A27 1680  4    before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex
A27 1690  3    case.
A27 1690  4       The New York Central also has asked the ICC to
A27 1700  3    permit it to gain control of the B+O.
A27 1710  1       Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads
A27 1710  8    in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger.
A27 1720  7    The proposed C+O-B+O railroad would make it the
A27 1730  5    hemisphere's second largest.
A27 1740  1    _WASHINGTON (AP)_
A27 1740  3       - The government's short-term borrowing costs rose
A27 1750  2    with Tuesday weekly offering of Treasury bills. On
A27 1750 10    $1.1 billion of 90-day bills, the average yield was
A27 1760  9    2.325%. The rate a week ago was 2.295%.
A27 1780  1    _WASHINGTON, MARCH 11 (UPI)._
A27 1780  5       - "Consumer uncertain about economic conditions".
A27 1790  2       This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook
A27 1800  2    given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National
A27 1810  1    Housing Center.
A27 1810  3       Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of
A27 1820  2    the builders were "resistance to high interest rates,
A27 1820 10    cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed,
A27 1830  7    shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable
A27 1840  4    to qualify".
A27 1840  6    #INCREASE EXPECTED#
A27 1840  8    The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders'
A27 1850  9    intentions conference. It disclosed that the builders:
A27 1860  6       Expect their own production volume, and presumably
A27 1870  4    sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.
A27 1880  1       Look for home building nationally to advance less
A27 1880  9    than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,7000 non-farm
A27 1890  8    housing starts. The industry has said 1960 was a poor
A27 1900  7    year. Starts were down 20 percent from 1959.
A27 1910  2       Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts
A27 1910  9    for themselves and for the industry?
A27 1920  6    #LEADERS OF INDUSTRY#
A27 1920  9    The reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders
A27 1930 10    invited to the intentions conference "are generally
A27 1940  5    among the more successful businessmen, and usually
A27 1950  3    do somewhat better than their fellow builders".
