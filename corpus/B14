B14 0010  1       This is the period during the melancholy days of
B14 0010 10    autumn when universities and colleges schedule what
B14 0020  5    they call "Homecoming Day". They seek thereby to lure
B14 0030  6    the old grad back to the old scenes.
B14 0040  1       The football opponent on homecoming is, of course,
B14 0040  9    selected with the view that said opponent will have
B14 0050  8    little more chance than did a Christian when thrown
B14 0060  3    to one of the emperor's lions. It is true, of course,
B14 0070  2    the uncertainties of life being what they are, that
B14 0070 11    as now and then the Christian killed the lion, homecoming
B14 0080  8    days have been ruined by a visiting team.
B14 0090  5       Even with all possible precaution, homecomings are
B14 0100  2    usually rather cruel and sad, and only the perpetually
B14 0100 11    ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy
B14 0110  8    by them.
B14 0110 10       More often than not, as the Old Grad wanders along
B14 0120 10    the old paths, his memory of happy days when he strolled
B14 0130  8    one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an
B14 0140  4    ache and a pain. He can smell again the perfume she
B14 0150  1    wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter, and
B14 0150 10    can smell again the aroma of autumn- fallen leaves,
B14 0160  6    the wine of cool air, and the nostalgia of woodsmoke
B14 0170  3    which blows through all the winds of fall.
B14 0170 11    #UNDERGRADUATES#
B14 0180  1    It is at precisely such moments that he encounters
B14 0180 10    a couple of undergraduates, faces alight, holding hands
B14 0190  7    and talking happily as they come along, oblivious of
B14 0200  7    him, or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of
B14 0210  4    glances, such as they would give a tethered goat. Usually,
B14 0220  1    they titter loudly after they have passed by.
B14 0220  9       His dream goes. He feels, suddenly, the weight of
B14 0230  8    the fat that is on him. His bridgework or his plates
B14 0240  5    feel loose and monstrous. His bifocals blur. His legs
B14 0250  3    suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary, as if
B14 0250 11    he had walked for miles, instead of strolling a few
B14 0260  9    hundred yards along the old campus paths. Bitterness
B14 0270  5    comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe
B14 0280  3    persimmons in his mouth.
B14 0280  7       It is not much better if he meets with old classmates.
B14 0290  6    Too often, unless he hails them, they pass him by.
B14 0300  4    He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said, on returning
B14 0310  1    from a homecoming reunion, that he would never go again
B14 0310 11    because all his class had changed so much they didn't
B14 0320  9    even recognize him.
B14 0330  1       If they do meet and recognize one another, slap
B14 0330 10    backs and embrace, the moment soon is done. After all,
B14 0340  8    when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie
B14 0350  6    ... when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married
B14 0360  3    and where it is they now live ... when questions are
B14 0360 14    asked and answered about families and children, and
B14 0370  8    old professors ... when the game and its probable outcome
B14 0380  7    has been exhausted ... that does it.
B14 0390  2    #MIDDLE-AGED SPREAD#
B14 0390  5    By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread;
B14 0400  2    the gray hairs, the eyeglasses, bodies that are too
B14 0400 11    thin or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty;
B14 0410 10    the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit
B14 0415  8    and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length
B14 0430  4    ... then, it is time to break it up and move on.
B14 0440  1       It is, if anything, worse on the old player ...
B14 0440 11       He sits in the stands and he doesn't like that.
B14 0450  9    Enough of his life was spent there on the field for
B14 0460  6    him never to like watching the game as a spectator
B14 0470  1    in the crowd. He always feels lonely. A team feels
B14 0470 11    something. On a team a man feels he is a part of it
B14 0480 13    and akin to the men next to him. In the stands he is
B14 0490  8    lonely and lost, no matter how many are about him.
B14 0500  2       He sits there remembering the tense moment before
B14 0500 10    the ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet,
B14 0510  9    the rasp of the canvas pants; the smell and feel of
B14 0520  8    hot, wet woolen sleeves across his face. He remembers
B14 0530  4    the desperate, panting breath; the long runs on the
B14 0540  3    kick-offs; the hard, jolting tackles; the breakthrough;
B14 0540 11    the desperate agony of goal-line stands. And so, he
B14 0550 10    squirms with each play, remembering his youth.
B14 0560  5       But it is no use. It is gone.
B14 0570  1       No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes
B14 0570 12    of his youth and strength, they can never be recaptured
B14 0580  7    again.
B14 0590  1       Since the obvious is not always true, the Republican
B14 0590 10    National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last
B14 0600  8    autumn and finds that it occurred, as suspected, in
B14 0610  6    the larger cities.
B14 0610  9       Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more,
B14 0620  7    Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14. There are
B14 0630  5    eight states in which the largest urban vote can be
B14 0640  3    the balance of power in any close election. These are
B14 0640 13    New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri,
B14 0650  6    New Jersey, Illinois and Minnesota. In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower
B14 0660  7    won all but Missouri. Yet, in 1960 all eight gave majorities
B14 0670  8    to Mr. Kennedy.
B14 0680  1       Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia.
B14 0680  9    Mr. Nixon, despite a very earnest effort to capture
B14 0690  8    the minority groups, failed to do so. His visit to
B14 0700  7    Warsaw, Poland, after the Russian journey in the summer
B14 0710  4    of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which,
B14 0720  1    in several cities, is substantial. Yet, the GOP breakdown
B14 0720 10    discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received
B14 0730  7    but 21 per cent of the so-called "Polish" vote; 30
B14 0740  7    per cent of the "Irish" vote, and 18 per cent of the
B14 0750  7    "Negro" vote.
B14 0750  9    #'TASK FORCE'#
B14 0760  1    A GOP "task force' committee will seek to find out
B14 0760 11    how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority
B14 0770 10    groups in cities.
B14 0780  1       The task force might make a start in Washington
B14 0780 10    with Republican congressional leaders. These gentlemen
B14 0790  5    already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance
B14 0800  6    to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism
B14 0810  5    of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment.
B14 0820  3    This error was compounded by declaring the recession
B14 0830  1    to be "a statistical one", and not a reality. The almost
B14 0830 12    six million persons without jobs and the two million
B14 0840  9    working part-time do not consider themselves and their
B14 0850  6    plight as statistical. They did not view the tour of
B14 0860  5    the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor
B14 0870  1    Goldberg as politics, which the GOP declared it to
B14 0870 10    be. The people visited were glad to have a government
B14 0880  9    with heart enough to take an interest in their misery.
B14 0890  6       Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's
B14 0900  4    conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy
B14 0910  4    as too left wing, a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared
B14 0920  2    to be entirely false, is another case in point. If
B14 0920 12    the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat
B14 0930  7    medical care for the old under the Social Security
B14 0940  6    program, they will thereby erect still another barrier
B14 0950  3    to GOP hopes in the cities.
B14 0950  9    #ERRORS REPEATED#
B14 0960  1    The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt,
B14 0960  9    Goldwater, Bridges, Dirksen, et al, is repeating the
B14 0970  8    errors of the party leadership of the 1930s. In that
B14 0980  7    decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover, and
B14 0990  3    the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the
B14 1000  1    depression, caused a great majority of Americans to
B14 1000  9    see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any
B14 1010  8    sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up
B14 1020  4    in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic
B14 1030  1    crash.
B14 1030  2       The Republican party was not lacking in humanity,
B14 1040  1    but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership
B14 1040  8    to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people
B14 1050  7    in trouble. Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup
B14 1060  4    trucks "Hoover carts". Smokers reduced to "the makings",
B14 1070  3    spoke of the sack tobacco as "Hoover dust".
B14 1080  1       One may be sure the present Republican congressional
B14 1080  9    leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error. But it
B14 1090  9    is in the process of so doing because it apparently
B14 1100  5    gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy.
B14 1110  3    That this is not good politics is underscored by the
B14 1120  1    latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of
B14 1120 11    the people like the way in which the new President
B14 1130  8    is conducting the nation's business.
B14 1140  1       The most articulate Republicans are those who, in
B14 1140  9    their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy, already have
B14 1150 10    created the image of a Republican leadership which
B14 1160  6    is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed,
B14 1170  4    and which is even more unwilling to help old people
B14 1180  1    who need medical care. If they also defeat the school
B14 1180 11    bill, the GOP task force won't have much research
B14 1190  8    to do. It will early know why the party won't win back
B14 1200  8    city votes.
B14 1210  1       The 1962 General Assembly has important business
B14 1210  8    to consider. The tragedy is that it will not be able
B14 1220 10    to transact that business in any responsible manner.
B14 1230  4       After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed
B14 1240  3    the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative
B14 1250  1    Forum, this is going to be the most politically oriented
B14 1250 11    Legislature in history.
B14 1260  3       Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston
B14 1270  2    is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest
B14 1270 13    scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances, not
B14 1280  9    his convictions.
B14 1290  1       Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the
B14 1290  9    county unit system stands less chance than ever. And
B14 1300  7    just how far can the Legislature go toward setting
B14 1310  4    up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst
B14 1320  2    of a governor's race"?
B14 1320  6       How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt.
B14 1330  3    Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government
B14 1340  3    Operations?
B14 1340  4       The situation already was bad because the Legislature
B14 1350  3    moved the governor's race forward a few months, causing
B14 1360  2    the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.
B14 1370  1       But when former Gov. Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov.
B14 1370  9    Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State
B14 1380  7    Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November,
B14 1390  5    the situation was aggravated.
B14 1390  9       Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation.
B14 1400 10    To have refused would have been political suicide.
B14 1410  6    And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed
B14 1420  3    the opportunity, when the bravado comments are cast
B14 1430  1    aside.
B14 1430  2       The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard
B14 1440  1    against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.
B14 1440  8    It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee
B14 1450  6    to pick the "serious candidates".
B14 1460  2       But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said
B14 1470  2    no, and he didn't mince any words. "They are just asking
B14 1480  1    too much", he said. We can't think of anyone else who
B14 1480 12    would want to separate serious candidates from other
B14 1490  7    candidates, either.
B14 1500  1       There are other dangers:
B14 1500  5       Politics is an accelerating game. "If an opponent
B14 1510  4    accuses you of lying, don't deny it. Say he is a horse
B14 1520  3    thief", runs an old adage.
B14 1520  8       These men are spenders. If either one ever started
B14 1530  6    making promises, there is no telling where the promises
B14 1540  3    would end. Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's
B14 1550  1    60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's
B14 1550 10    oaths.
B14 1560  1       The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks
B14 1560 11    like such a good one. Why not have them travel the
B14 1570 10    state in November debating? It would present a forum
B14 1580  6    for them in almost every community.
B14 1590  1       But further thought brings the shuddery visions
B14 1590  8    of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature,
B14 1600  8    the spectre of big spending programs, the ooze of mudslinging
B14 1610  6    before the campaign should even begin. There isa way
B14 1620  4    out of this. The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative
B14 1630  1    forum. It has arranged a campaign for governor.
B14 1640  1       If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications
B14 1640 10    are closed next spring, and then carry all the candidates
B14 1650  9    on a tour of debates, it can provide a service to the
B14 1660  8    state.
B14 1660  9       But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity
B14 1670  5    to compelte its work before choosing up sides for the
B14 1680  5    race.
B14 1690  1       Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower
B14 1690  8    was not a "great soldier". Ike's somewhat like George
B14 1710  7    Washington. Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a
B14 1720 10    modest assist from British strategy.
B14 1730  1       Congressmen returning from recess say the people
B14 1730  8    admire President Kennedy so much, they're even willing
B14 1740  8    to heed his call to sacrifice- and give up his program.
B14 1750  8       Slogan of the John Birch Society: "Paddle your own
B14 1760  6    canoe. The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist".
B14 1770  7       A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election
B14 1780  5    on the religious issue. Too many people were afraid
B14 1790  2    if the GOP won, they'd have to spend all their time
B14 1790 13    praying.
