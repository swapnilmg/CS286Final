P06 0010  1       How, he wondered, does one enjoy one's spare time?
P06 0010 10    He considered some interesting excursion but he was
P06 0020  7    on the road every day from dawn to dusk. Then there
P06 0030  6    was exercise, boating and hiking, which was not only
P06 0040  3    good for you but also made you more virile: the thought
P06 0050  1    of strenuous activity left him exhausted. Perhaps golf,
P06 0050  9    with a fashionable companion- but he'd lost his clubs,
P06 0060  6    hadn't played in years. There was swimming over at
P06 0070  6    the Riverside Hotel, but his skin was so white he looked
P06 0080  5    like the bottom of a frog. Perhaps a packing trip into
P06 0090  2    the Sierras, let his beard grow- but that was too stark.
P06 0090 13    I could, he thought, take a long walk- but where?
P06 0100  9       The telephone rang.
P06 0110  2       "You missed it", Buzz's voice said, "You should
P06 0120  1    have gone over to the Pagan Room with us. Wow. Strippers,
P06 0120 12    but scrumptious, and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian
P06 0130  9    band".
P06 0140  1       "Hi, Buzz", Owen said. "I went over to the Willows
P06 0140 11    and dropped two notes".
P06 0150  3       "Tough", Buzz said, "Listen, we're having a stag
P06 0160  4    dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday. Imagine a
P06 0170  2    stag dinner with Toodle Williams". He laughed and laughed.
P06 0180  1       Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the
P06 0180 10    territory next to his, but he hadn't come to Reno for
P06 0190 10    stag dinners. "Thanks", Owen said, "but Friday is a
P06 0200  7    long way off and anything can happen".
P06 0210  1       Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his
P06 0210 10    victims rest. When Owen was finally rid of him, there
P06 0220 10    was a timid rap at the door.
P06 0230  2       "Yes", Owen called out. "Yes"?
P06 0230  7       "I'm Mrs. Gertrude Parker", a soft voice explained,
P06 0240  8    "And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes, please".
P06 0250 11       Ahah, he thought, a lush divorcee at last. Probably
P06 0260  8    saw me in the lobby. He was disappointed to find a
P06 0270  6    nervous, scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the
P06 0280  3    door. She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow
P06 0280 13    moons.
P06 0290  1       "How do you do"? she said, semi-professionally.
P06 0290  9    "Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous
P06 0300  9    women up in Alaska. We call them lay-sisters and they
P06 0310  8    go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the
P06 0320  4    light. They're up there in that freezing climate and
P06 0330  2    all of us have to try and help them".
P06 0330 11       "Oh"?
P06 0340  1       "You see", she said, looking past him into the room,
P06 0340 11    where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright
P06 0350  9    light, "you and I can't understand the many hardships
P06 0360  6    they have to undergo".
P06 0370  1       "Why is that"?
P06 0370  3       She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction.
P06 0380  3    Smug, Owen thought, smug and sappy. There was a slight
P06 0390  1    nervous twitch in the region of her left eye. It gave
P06 0390 12    her a lewd, winking effect.
P06 0400  2       "Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo"?
P06 0410  1    she asked, winking wildly. "They are a very difficult
P06 0410 10    group of people".
P06 0420  3       "I don't know much about them", Owen admitted, "but
P06 0430  2    I suppose they have their own religion and they probably
P06 0440  1    resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to
P06 0440 10    do and what not to do".
P06 0450  3       She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion. "You know,
P06 0460  1    that's very interesting. People don't know how much
P06 0460  9    they give away about themselves by remarks like that.
P06 0470  8    The more canvassing I do, the more I note how far most
P06 0480  8    people are from their personal God".
P06 0490  1       Forebearing, Owen kept his peace. What would happen
P06 0490  9    next? That she was out for a touch was certain, but
P06 0500 11    when did she get to the pitch? Several people passed
P06 0510  5    in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated, trying
P06 0520  3    to close the door a little, and she slowly leaned toward
P06 0530  1    him and raised her voice.
P06 0530  6       "How did you get by the desk"? he asked curiously.
P06 0540  4    "I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around
P06 0550  3    the corridors, knocking on strangers' doors and talking
P06 0560  2    down Eskimos".
P06 0560  4       "Oh, I just come once a week. Every day I visit
P06 0570  5    a different hotel. I feel it's my duty. I do this work
P06 0580  2    all on my own, because I understand the difficulties
P06 0580 11    and I want to help these lay-sisters. Do you know these
P06 0590 11    women go all through Alaska, and they don't have the
P06 0600  7    proper facilities? They travel in pairs as much as
P06 0610  6    a hundred-and-fifty miles a day".
P06 0610 13       "Do you have any idea how far I travel every day?
P06 0620 11    I have the whole Pacific Northwest". Owen was aware
P06 0630  5    he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself.
P06 0640  4       Mrs. gertrude Parker drew back. "That's hardly a
P06 0650  4    Christian approach", she remonstrated. "You're in the
P06 0660  3    secular world".
P06 0660  5       "I didn't say it was Christian. I don't think you'll
P06 0670  5    find many active Christian salesmen. Not that religion
P06 0680  4    isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books make
P06 0690  2    a lot of money for publishing houses, but they don't
P06 0690 12    get top personnel. Our key salesmen are in appliances
P06 0700  8    and cosmetics".
P06 0710  1       "God, I take it, plays no part in this", she said
P06 0710 12    waspishly.
P06 0720  1       "God doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics", he
P06 0720  9    said heatedly before he caught himself. It sounded
P06 0730  8    silly; why go on? More people were passing; he had
P06 0740  7    to find some way to close this impossible conversation.
P06 0750  2       "And whiskey", she said, smiling and blinking at
P06 0760  3    the highball glasses. "Don't forget whiskey; it's such
P06 0770  2    a big seller".
P06 0770  5       "You know", he said, getting a grip on himself,
P06 0780  3    "I think you're going to have to excuse me. I have
P06 0790  1    an appointment".
P06 0790  3       "I can imagine", she said. "Probably down at the
P06 0800  4    bar. But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters?
P06 0810  1    They must be freezing up there now. Can't you help
P06 0810 11    them"?
P06 0820  1       "Leave a card or something. I'll think it over".
P06 0830  1       "I have no card", she said bitterly. "You haven't
P06 0830  9    been listening to what I've been telling you. I only
P06 0840  9    hope my talking to you has helped you a little, anyway,
P06 0850  6    because you need spiritual bucking-up". She looked
P06 0860  3    crestfallen, as if he had somehow disappointed the
P06 0860 11    whole human race. She stood indecisively for a moment,
P06 0870  9    then walked down the hall; he heard her knocking on
P06 0880  8    another door.
P06 0880 10       It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself;
P06 0890  7    then he realized he was hungry. He showered, shaved,
P06 0900  4    dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast.
P06 0910  2    On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail.
P06 0910 14    There was a check from his company, and the usual enthusiastic
P06 0920 11    bulletins on new lines they always issued. His lawyer
P06 0930  9    had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony, and
P06 0940  6    there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue
P06 0950  4    asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's
P06 0960  2    exemptions.
P06 0960  3       He ate breakfast in a sullen mood, but afterwards,
P06 0970  2    when he walked out onto Virginia Street, he felt braced.
P06 0980  1    He looked off to the crest of the Sierras, still white-topped;
P06 0980 13    the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle.
P06 0990 10    He felt suddenly elated, adventurous. With any luck
P06 1000  6    at all he could easily find a flowerpot.
P06 1010  1       Although it was only three o'clock, he stopped in
P06 1020  1    at the Golden Calf. The tables were all spinning, the
P06 1020 11    dice rattling, the bar crowded. Just to test himself,
P06 1030  8    he played roulette for quarters on his old combination,
P06 1040  5    five and seventeen, and within an hour, he had won,
P06 1050  3    surprisingly, twenty dollars. The way was opening up;
P06 1050 11    when the management brought around champagne, the breakfast
P06 1060  8    settled its whirling around in his stomach.
P06 1070  6       The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon.
P06 1080  4    There were more women than men in the place, but he
P06 1090  2    couldn't find a flowerpot. They all had the hard look
P06 1090 12    of gamblers who had stopped dreaming, who automatically
P06 1100  7    turned the cards, hardly caring what showed up. The
P06 1110  6    mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered
P06 1120  3    wagons, who appeared much more animated than the gamblers.
P06 1130  1    The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned
P06 1130 11    out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance,
P06 1140  9    while the men were stern but hopeful. All, of course,
P06 1150  7    except the Donner party who were bent on starving to
P06 1160  5    death.
P06 1160  6       "I wonder if they did eat each other at the end",
P06 1170  5    Owen mused.
P06 1170  7       He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde,
P06 1180  2    but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes. She sighed
P06 1190  2    a dirty word and left. Owen was surprised to see Mrs.
P06 1190 13    Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were
P06 1200  9    cunningly arranged by the entrance. She sat down and
P06 1210  8    played two slots at once, looking grim, as if bested
P06 1220  4    by mechanical devices, and Owen felt sorry for the
P06 1230  1    lay-sisters depending on her support.
P06 1230  7       A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's
P06 1240  7    place. He was a little more authentic than usual because
P06 1250  4    he smelled slightly of the stables. "What you need
P06 1260  2    is a steady martingale", the cowboy announced after
P06 1260 10    watching Owen play. "You can't build on your hit-and-miss
P06 1270 10    five-seventeen".
P06 1280  1       "What are you playing"? Owen asked.
P06 1280  7       "I'm just logging", the cowboy explained. "I keep
P06 1290  8    all these plays in this little black book, and I watch
P06 1300  7    over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers
P06 1310  4    are repeating. But roulette's not my game. I'm always
P06 1320  1    trying to find a breaking table in blackjack. Incidentally,
P06 1320 10    I'm pretty famous in these parts: I'm called The Wrangler".
P06 1340  1       "Nice to know you. Don't you have to spend any time
P06 1340 12    on your ranch"?
P06 1350  2       "Well, of course I do. I'm with the Bar-H, pushing
P06 1360  2    a horse called Sparky. He's my own horse, and what
P06 1370  1    I collect from him I use on blackjack. This Sparky
P06 1370 11    can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing
P06 1380  6    in Washoe County. I figure if I can get any kind of
P06 1390  7    publicity campaign going, I'll land him on TV- you
P06 1400  2    know, one of those favorite horses for some Western
P06 1400 11    hero. I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson, but nothing
P06 1410 11    like Sparky. He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully".
P06 1420  8       Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler
P06 1430  9    and he neglected to play, a loss of ten dollars. This
P06 1440  8    proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx, so
P06 1450  5    he walked on down to Hurrays, an even more glorified
P06 1460  1    gambling den than the Golden Calf. When he looked in
P06 1460 11    the back, Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards.
P06 1470  8       His adventurous spirit had waned; he studied the
P06 1480  7    pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added
P06 1490  5    attraction. He ogled a long redhead with green eyes,
P06 1500  2    but she was a shill with her money in front of her.
P06 1500 14    He had no great prejudice against shills; it just seemed
P06 1520  7    such a dry run.
P06 1530  1       There was no cash around; everyone was flipping
P06 1530  9    silver dollars. The management discreetly withdrew
P06 1540  4    the green stuff into the office and gave the customers
P06 1550  3    chips or checks or premium points. He read a special
P06 1560  1    announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special
P06 1560  8    floorshow at three a.m. starring Adele (The Body) Brenner
P06 1570  7    and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls.
P06 1580  2       He wondered if he might bag a tourist, but they
P06 1590  2    looked frightened of him. He passed two brides, both
P06 1590 11    wearing orchids, and they made him feel a little sad.
P06 1600  9       Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck. Buzz had
P06 1610  6    on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil
P06 1620  4    and dark glasses. He was shorter and fatter than Owen,
P06 1630  1    who felt good standing next to him. "We're all going
P06 1630 11    over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva", Buzz
P06 1640 10    explained, still instigating. "We ran into a guy at
P06 1650  8    the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel.
P06 1660  6    He started out as a stickman, then became a pit boss
P06 1670  2    until the Club found him crossroading. He was knocking
P06 1670 11    down checks at faro".
P06 1680  3       "I'm allergic to Tahoe", Owen explained. "Something
P06 1690  2    about the pollen".
P06 1690  5       "Well, okay", Buzz said. "We'll see you around later".
P06 1700  7       Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were
P06 1710  8    hot, but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success.
P06 1720  4       "How's your luck, honey"? A short platinum blonde
P06 1730  4    in a bursting sun-suit addressed him. She looked well-fed
P06 1740  3    and prosperous, but he didn't get the impression he
P06 1740 12    was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping.
P06 1750  7       "I haven't had any luck since I was a baby".
P06 1760  9       "Stake me", she said, "and let me at those dice.
P06 1770  7    I'll make them dance the tango. We'll get it in a hurry
P06 1780  6    and get it out".
P06 1780 10       "Let's have a drink and discuss a merger".
P06 1790  5       "If you go broke", she said, smiling up at him,
P06 1800  4    "I'll leave you".
P06 1800  7       "Sounds like real love", Owen said. "It sort of
P06 1810  7    brings a lump to my throat".
P06 1820  1       "My name's Gisele", the blonde said after she ordered
P06 1820 10    a Scotch. "Named after the ballet. My mother wanted
P06 1830  9    to call me Sylphide, but it sounded too affected".
