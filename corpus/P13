P13 0010  1       But one night Dookiyoon moved in the direction of
P13 0010 10    the women's lodge, where Shades of Night had gone to
P13 0020  9    purify herself.
P13 0030  1       With the blue flesh of night touching him he stood
P13 0030 10    under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his
P13 0040  6    lips, making it whisper. He saw her emerge suddenly,
P13 0050  3    coming in her unhesitant fashion, her back stiff, her
P13 0060  1    head erect, facing with contempt the night and whatever
P13 0060 10    she would encounter, as if in her extreme disdain and
P13 0070  8    indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks
P13 0080  6    of those whom she might approach. In her dark, scornful
P13 0090  2    fashion she proceeded to her destination, afraid of
P13 0090 10    nothing, not even the evil spirits which kept her company
P13 0100 10    in her time of bleeding.
P13 0110  1       Seeing her come, he caught his breath, feeling his
P13 0110 10    heart bounce in him, and turned away, afraid now. Even
P13 0120 10    he, wanting her, afraid of her and not knowing how
P13 0130  8    to press his suit, feared the evil presences in her
P13 0140  3    metabolism more. His breath caught, and, trembling,
P13 0140 10    he closed his eyes and stumbled off. Going, he saw
P13 0150 10    as often before some queer, hideous yellow face over
P13 0160  6    his head, shining and weird like the old images which
P13 0170  2    had invested him at other times like those that appear
P13 0180  1    sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed
P13 0180 10    by the thumbs.
P13 0190  1       He cried out to her, his back turned. Then he fled,
P13 0190 12    not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice
P13 0200 11    of his cry.
P13 0200 14       But she heard him go. Yet she did not hesitate and
P13 0210 11    only turned slightly, her neck tall as she looked in
P13 0220  8    his direction, and continued on her way toward the
P13 0230  3    end of the camp.
P13 0230  7       Elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited, the
P13 0240  4    women peering from their lodges then gathering in small,
P13 0250  2    curious clusters. Early Spring came from her bed, from
P13 0250 11    beside her half-drunk husband, Walitzee, and stood
P13 0260  8    at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion,
P13 0270  7    the sound of hushed voices. Standing there she saw
P13 0280  4    Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside
P13 0290  2    the lodge, silent, almost imperious, her body taut,
P13 0290 10    simply standing without speaking or moving while the
P13 0300  7    wife of Walitzee waited, perhaps denying the dread
P13 0310  4    that moved in her. When at last she could suffer the
P13 0320  2    insult no longer, nor face the girl's scorn, she said
P13 0320 12    in a voice overloud:
P13 0330  3       "I shall call your father! Go back where you can
P13 0340  3    bring no harm, or I will go and get the old man from
P13 0340 16    his bed so he can see your shame"!
P13 0350  7       But the girl said only, "Tell him I am here, that
P13 0360  6    I have come". And it was not Pile of Clouds she meant.
P13 0370  3       But now with real anger at last, something proud
P13 0380  1    and indignant, Early Spring stood like a she wolf before
P13 0380 11    her den and cried, "I will not shriek at you! I will
P13 0390 11    tell you to go, not begging. Telling you"! And unsheathing
P13 0400  6    the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away
P13 0410  6    from the lodge, holding the knife at her side.
P13 0420  2       "You bring only wickedness", she said and it was
P13 0420 11    not to a child any longer but to another woman who
P13 0430 11    had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger
P13 0440  6    of a wild animal. Speaking in a low voice of loathing
P13 0450  3    she went up to the girl, who stood with the same upright,
P13 0460  1    scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife.
P13 0460 11       "Go take helsq'iyokom, your evil spirit, to the
P13 0470  8    young boys", the woman said. "They do not have to face
P13 0480  9    battle. I will not let your evil in. I will simply
P13 0490  6    kill you first. Now go"!
P13 0490 11       The other women had come close now, their voices
P13 0500  8    murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry
P13 0510  6    knot, their threats mingling, rising, nagging at each
P13 0520  3    other, each trying to make her indignation and anger
P13 0520 12    felt. They picked up sticks and hurled them at the
P13 0530 10    girl. The sticks fell like a shower around her and
P13 0540  7    she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points
P13 0550  2    of pain along her thighs. They were all shouting at
P13 0550 12    her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought.
P13 0560 11    But she did not move, taking the words and the sticks
P13 0570  8    in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly
P13 0580  4    Pile of Clouds came howling among them, swinging a
P13 0600  2    great bullhide whip.
P13 0600  5       "Go back to your lodges"! he shouted. "A pack of
P13 0610  5    dogs makes less noise"! He made the long whip sing
P13 0620  3    and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming,
P13 0620 13    some tripping over themselves in their flight. And
P13 0630  8    Early Spring seized the whip and said:
P13 0640  5       "If you must flog someone, let it be her, your daughter.
P13 0650  3    Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away
P13 0660  2    from my husband"! But the old man turned on her, jerking
P13 0660 13    the whip from her hand.
P13 0670  5       "Get into your hovel"! he spat. "Go back to that
P13 0680  4    double-married man of yours who so parades his fine
P13 0680 14    body among the young women. Keep him back, if you must
P13 0690 11    tell me what to do. I will be the one to confront my
P13 0700 10    daughter, not the wife of him who leads her to sin"!
P13 0710  5       She retreated before the naked shame in the old
P13 0720  4    man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness
P13 0720 15    of her lodge where Walitzee stirred, mumbling, sitting
P13 0730  7    up in a half stupor to say:
P13 0740  3       "What worrisome thing happens? I thought I dreamed
P13 0750  2    of wolves fighting". But she went to him and pressed
P13 0750 12    herself against his nakedness, smelling the stale odor
P13 0760  8    of the whisky he had stolen from TuHulHulZote.
P13 0770  4       She said, "There is nothing that concerns you here.
P13 0780  5    Lie back and go to sleep. But do not dream. Do not
P13 0790  3    let the wicked spirits enter your brain".
P13 0790 10       He sank back, sighing, and was soon asleep again.
P13 0800  7       Outside, the old man, beyond all the curses of the
P13 0810  7    spirits his daughter bore, went to her and twisted
P13 0820  2    the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned
P13 0820 13    her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees
P13 0830 11    where the moon sent out a thousand arms. And, shoving
P13 0840  7    her against a spruce, her back to him, he retreated
P13 0850  4    with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp
P13 0860  1    air, shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh
P13 0860 11    and the sound of it snarled and cracked, settling its
P13 0870  8    own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as
P13 0880  5    unchanged, as dark and motionless as ever, her eyes
P13 0890  2    open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark
P13 0890 12    so close to her face.
P13 0900  4       She said to him, her father, "How was I begotten,
P13 0910  1    in pain or joy? Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh
P13 0910 14    you made grow on me? They all know your foolish name"!
P13 0920 10       She stared at the pale tracings on the tree, hearing
P13 0930  9    her breath refracted from it, her face close and touching
P13 0940  7    at time the rough edges of the bark. She felt the lash
P13 0950  5    bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables
P13 0960  1    words which had no meaning, like, "unnnt! ... sssshoo"!
P13 0960 10    The sounds of an animal in rage and despair.
P13 0970  9       Suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she
P13 0980  7    heard Pile of Clouds say in his high, quavering voice:
P13 0990  3       "Did you follow me to see my shame? Move from the
P13 1000  4    line or I will settle the whip on you ... Move! Do
P13 1010  1    you hear the anger of the whip's whine"?
P13 1010  9       Turning, the girl saw Dookiyoon standing between,
P13 1020  6    his narrow shoulders unbent, his arms hanging long
P13 1030  4    and resigned. He said, "Let me take her blows, for
P13 1040  2    there are demons in me too".
P13 1040  8       Then, without knowing why, she found herself running
P13 1050  5    from them, fleeing wildly through the trees, dodging
P13 1060  2    her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in
P13 1060 13    the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind
P13 1070 10    which she knelt and hid, listening to the madness of
P13 1080  6    her heart and wanting for once to cry.
P13 1090  1    #II#
P13 1090  2    For a while the young men waited outside the lodge
P13 1090 12    of Tu Hul Hul Zote, glorying in his harsh language
P13 1100  9    as he talked with himself. He shouted like a hoarse
P13 1110  6    old mastiff, his hair stiff and bristling. He ranted
P13 1120  3    and prophesied the doom of his enemies, walking in
P13 1120 12    circles in and out of his living place, drinking stolen
P13 1130 10    whisky in great, gasping draughts until finally, incoherent
P13 1140  6    and sick, he fell into his own oblivion. He amused
P13 1150  5    the young men who had been silent long enough. But
P13 1160  2    they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution
P13 1170  1    through his antics. Now they moved, rubbing their flesh
P13 1170 10    alive again, disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces
P13 1180  9    around them.
P13 1180 11       They came out and held their games and races. It
P13 1190 10    was they who held the future in their hands. They went
P13 1200  7    into the sun together and paraded grandly in their
P13 1210  3    war clothes, painting their faces with the sacred attis
P13 1220  1    dug far off in the cave of skeletons. They danced the
P13 1220 12    paxam wildly at night, the war dance, and dipped their
P13 1230 10    arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their
P13 1240  6    horses in swift maneuvers, firing their few guns in
P13 1250  4    unison at some indeterminate signal.
P13 1250  9       Walitzee was among them, and Sarpsis, and they wore
P13 1260  9    red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air
P13 1270  6    of their passing. And a very young one, Swan Necklace,
P13 1280  2    tried to emulate them and followed timidly. Yellow
P13 1280 10    Wolf was there, nephew of the young chief by an older
P13 1290 11    brother long dead, in whom also the disordered chemistries
P13 1300  7    of youth worked. He would spring bolt upright suddenly
P13 1310  4    after sitting quietly with inaction, because something
P13 1320  2    had boiled over in his fermenting juices.
P13 1320  9       All the young men, Alokut among them, challenged
P13 1330  7    them in matched racing. They raced and maneuvered for
P13 1340  5    war, swinging their horses in single file and then
P13 1350  3    abreast like cavalry. At times they would ride frenziedly
P13 1350 12    through the camp, letting the women see their courage,
P13 1360  9    how handsome they were in their regalia. Then again
P13 1370  7    they would stand in circles making other preparations.
P13 1380  3    They combed their hair and streaked it at the part
P13 1390  1    and greased the bangs so that the hair above their
P13 1390 11    foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making
P13 1400  9    love.
P13 1400 10       Walitzee whitened his leggings with clay, knowing
P13 1410  6    the girl watched from her place in the trees. He saw
P13 1420  5    himself in a superior reflection, and he was as a speeding
P13 1430  2    arrow from the taut bow, hurtling with a mad grace,
P13 1430 12    his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue. He
P13 1440  8    was always aware of the women's eyes which followed
P13 1450  4    him, admiring him. And the suspicious, envenomed eyes
P13 1460  2    of Pile of Clouds. And those of Early Spring, haunted
P13 1470  1    and now full of hurt and envy. He felt so much like
P13 1480 11    laughing; even like shouting and crying out from the
P13 1490  8    hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in
P13 1500  5    a mad caper from the cliffs.
P13 1500 11       He and Sarpsis planned a great parade with the young
P13 1510  8    men. They would give one final testimony of their challenge
P13 1520  5    to let the people see their arrogance. They would ride
P13 1530  4    with streaming amulets, their colors ripening in the
P13 1540  1    sun, shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the
P13 1540 11    throes of death.
P13 1550  1       And so the sun came up again and for a moment its
P13 1550 13    color was the young men's blood, shifting then into
P13 1560  8    the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts.
P13 1570  6    They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills.
P13 1580  4    #III#
P13 1580  5    The young chief stared at the wall of his lodge, listening.
P13 1590  3    The sound rose on the other side of the hills, vanished
P13 1600  1    and rose again and he could imagine the mad, disheveled
P13 1600 11    hoofs of the Appaloosas, horses the white men once
P13 1610  8    had called the Dogs of Hell. He saw them in fleet images
P13 1620  7    as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge.
P13 1630  3    Standing then with the others, peering into the sun,
P13 1640  1    he saw the bright, multicolored legion, their hair
P13 1640  9    flying like dark banners, only the thunder, the roll
P13 1650  6    of drums, the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying
P13 1660  3    them. They leaned into the wind and seemed like one
P13 1670  1    thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until
P13 1670  8    suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in
P13 1680  7    one terrifying voice shouted, ejaculated their grotesque
P13 1690  3    cry of war.
