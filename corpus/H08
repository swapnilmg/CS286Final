H08 0010  9    NOTTE,JR. GOVERNOR#
H08 0020  2    The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will
H08 0030  1    be "Independence and Union". It commemorates the 185th
H08 0030  9    anniversary of Rhode Island's Independence when, upon
H08 0040  7    May 4, 1776, the General Assembly, by its action, established
H08 0050  7    the first free republic in the New World.
H08 0060  5       As this year marks the centennial of the beginning
H08 0070  2    of the Civil War, this fact is being commemorated with
H08 0070 12    several exhibits throughout the State, but most of
H08 0080  8    all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers
H08 0090  6    who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington,
H08 0100  4    putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only
H08 0110  3    fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.
H08 0120  1       On April 30, ceremonies commemorating the departure
H08 0120  8    of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at
H08 0130  8    the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence. The Independence
H08 0140  5    Day celebration will be properly observed with a big
H08 0150  5    military and civic parade from West Warwick to the
H08 0160  3    Greene Homestead in Anthony; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO
H08 0160 11    I, JOHN A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE
H08 0170 11    ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK
H08 0180  5    OF APRIL 29TH TO MAY 7TH, 1961, AS RHODE ISLAND HERITAGE
H08 0190  5    WEEK, advising our citizens that throughout this week
H08 0200  3    many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be
H08 0200 11    open to visitors as well as industrial plants, craft
H08 0210  9    shops, museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all
H08 0220  4    to take advantage of these opportunities to see as
H08 0230  4    many of these places as they can during this outstanding
H08 0240  1    week.
H08 0240  2       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand
H08 0250  1    and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this
H08 0250 12    21st day of April, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand
H08 0260  9    nine hundred and sixty-one and on Independence, the
H08 0270  5    one hundred and eighty-fifth.

H08 0290  1    #ARMED FORCES DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A. NOTTE, JR.
H08 0290 10    GOVERNOR#
H08 0290 11    The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the
H08 0300  9    unification of our Armed Forces under the National
H08 0310  7    Security Act of 1947.
H08 0320  1       National defense, like the continuing search for
H08 0320  7    peace with freedom and justice for all, is "everybody's
H08 0330  7    business". Our investment in this effort, the greatest
H08 0340  6    in our Nation's history, reflects our determination
H08 0350  2    to ensure the peace and the future of freedom.
H08 0350 11       It is a sound investment. As the President has said,
H08 0360 10    "only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can
H08 0370  7    we be certain that they will never be employed".
H08 0380  3       Armed Forces Day is the annual report on this investment,
H08 0390  3    a public presentation designed to give our own people,
H08 0400  1    and the people of other lands who stand with us for
H08 0400 12    peace with freedom and justice, the best possible opportunity
H08 0410  7    to see and understand what we have and why we have
H08 0420  7    it.
H08 0420  8       It is the purpose of Armed Forces Day to give Americans
H08 0430  5    an opportunity to honor men of the Armed Forces, those
H08 0440  3    who have made the supreme sacrifice, those who remain
H08 0450  1    to preserve our security. Freedom depends upon them;
H08 0450  9    NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR
H08 0460  8    OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS,
H08 0470  4    PROCLAIM SATURDAY, MAY 20th, 1961, AS ARMED FORCES
H08 0480  4    DAY, reminding our citizens that we should rededicate
H08 0490  1    ourselves to our Nation, respecting the uniforms as
H08 0490  9    the guardians of our precious liberty.
H08 0500  5       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand
H08 0510  5    and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this
H08 0520  2    17th day of May, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand
H08 0520 14    nine hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, the
H08 0530  8    one hundred and eighty-sixth.

H08 0550  1    #NATIONAL MARITIME DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A. NOTTE,
H08 0550  9    JR. GOVERNOR#
H08 0560  1    The President of the United States, pursuant to a Joint
H08 0560 11    Resolution of Congress, has issued a proclamation each
H08 0570  8    year since 1933 declaring may 22nd to be National Maritime
H08 0580  8    Day.
H08 0580  9       This date in 1819 marked the sailing of the S. S.
H08 0590  9    "Savannah" from Savannah, Georgia, for Liverpool. This
H08 0600  5    voyage was the first successful crossing of the Atlantic
H08 0610  5    under steam propulsion. The day is now appropriately
H08 0620  1    set aside to honor the American men and women who have
H08 0620 12    contributed to the success of our merchant marine fleet
H08 0630  9    in peace and war.
H08 0640  1       The Merchant Marine is the "Fourth Arm of Defense",
H08 0640 10    for a strong and effective American Merchant Marine
H08 0650  8    is essential to the economy and security of our Nation.
H08 0660  8       Through trade and travel across the seas the American
H08 0670  6    Merchant Marine is carrying out its historic mission
H08 0680  3    of linking the United States of America with friendly
H08 0690  1    nations across the seas; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I,
H08 0690 10    JOHN A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE
H08 0700  9    ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM MONDAY,
H08 0710  3    MAY 22nd, 1961, AS NATIONAL MARITIME DAY, reminding
H08 0720  3    our citizens that American Merchant ships and American
H08 0730  1    seamen are ready at all times to serve our Nation in
H08 0730 12    the cause of freedom and justice.
H08 0740  5       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand
H08 0750  5    and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this
H08 0760  2    20th day of April, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand
H08 0760 14    nine hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, the

H08 0870  1       Many hours are given free by the Jaycees to make
H08 0870 11    this and all local pageants outstanding events. Proceeds
H08 0880  6    realized from these pageants are used by the Jaycees
H08 0890  6    to help support their various youth, health, welfare
H08 0900  2    and community betterment activities throughout the
H08 0900  8    state.

H08 0910  9    says that within a short time- on June 17th- her reign
H08 0920 10    will come to an end. She hopes that all will support

H08 1060  1    For the purpose of maintaining international peace
H08 1060  8    and promoting the advancement of all people, the United
H08 1070  8    States of America joined in founding the United Nations.
H08 1080  6       The United Nations Charter sets forth standards
H08 1090  4    which, if adhered to, will promote peace and justice
H08 1100  1    throughout the world. It is extremely important for
H08 1100  9    each American to realize that the theme "The United
H08 1110  8    Nations is your business" applies to him personally.
H08 1120  5       The world desperately needs the United Nations.
H08 1130  3    United Nations Day is the birthday of the United Nations,
H08 1140  2    mankind's noblest attempt to establish lasting peace

H08 1250  1    #THE STATE BALLET OF RHODE ISLAND WEEK PROCLAMATION
H08 1250  9    BY JOHN A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR#
H08 1260  3    The ballet originated in Italy about 1450. At that
H08 1270  2    time it was a series of sophisticated social dances
H08 1270 11    whose steps were often combined with other steps devised
H08 1280  8    by the choreographer. Ballet flowered in Italy during
H08 1290  5    the next hundred years, and about 1550 was carried
H08 1300  3    to France when the Italian princess, Catherine de Medicis,
H08 1310  1    married the King of France. The most famous ballet
H08 1310 10    of that time was called Ballet Comique de la Reine
H08 1320  8    (1581). Dances alternated with sung or spoken verses.
H08 1330  6    Ballets were used in opera from its beginning. They
H08 1340  2    were placed either in the middle of the acts or in
H08 1340 13    the intermissions.
H08 1350  1       The State Ballet of Rhode Island, the first incorporated
H08 1360  2    group, was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge
H08 1370  1    of the art of ballet in the Community, to promote interest
H08 1370 12    in ballet performances, to contribute to the cultural
H08 1380  7    life of the State, and to provide opportunity for gifted
H08 1390  5    dance students who, for one reason or another, are
H08 1400  3    unable to pursue a career and to develop others for
H08 1400 13    the professional state; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN
H08 1410  8    A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
H08 1420  8    AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF MONDAY,
H08 1430  6    NOVEMBER 13, 1961, AS THE STATE BALLET OF RHODE ISLAND
H08 1440  3    WEEK, requesting all Rhode Islanders to give special
H08 1450  1    attention to this unusual event which should contribute
H08 1450  9    to the cultural life of the State.
H08 1460  5       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand
H08 1470  4    and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this
H08 1480  1    23d day of October, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand
H08 1480 13    nine hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, the

H08 1510  1    #PROCLAMATION THANKSGIVING DAY BY JOHN A. NOTTE, JR.
H08 1510  9    GOVERNOR#
H08 1510 10    As another Thanksgiving draws near, let us take time
H08 1520  9    out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try
H08 1530  8    and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of
H08 1540  4    the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving.
H08 1550  1       The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His
H08 1550  9    benevolence during their first year in the new land.
H08 1560  8    They had been through trying times, but their faith
H08 1570  4    in the Almighty had given them the courage and the
H08 1570 14    strength to meet and overcome the many problems and
H08 1580  9    difficulties that were the price they had to pay for
H08 1590  8    freedom. And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble
H08 1600  5    gratitude, they shared another feeling- the anticipation
H08 1610  1    of what the future held for them and their posterity.
H08 1610 11    They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty
H08 1620 10    and freedom would some day be born a new nation that
H08 1630  9    for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed
H08 1640  5    countries of the world. They simply turned to God filled
H08 1650  2    with gratitude and faith.
H08 1650  6       We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson
H08 1660  5    from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day.
H08 1670  2    The Lord has shown time and time again His love for
H08 1670 13    us. We have only to compare the liberty and high standard
H08 1680 11    of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression
H08 1690  9    and frugality of other nations to realize with humble
H08 1700  6    gratitude that God's Providence has been with us since
H08 1710  5    the very beginning of our country. And yet, accompanying
H08 1720  1    our gratitude is the realization that we are living
H08 1720 10    in a crucial time. With world peace constantly being
H08 1730  7    threatened, most of us regard the future skeptically,
H08 1740  4    and even with fear. It is at this time that we should
H08 1750  3    imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of
H08 1750 11    thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to
H08 1760  9    be in dire need for the Lord's protection in the future,
H08 1770  7    if we are to have peace; NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN
H08 1780  5    A. NOTTE, JR., GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
H08 1790  3    AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THURSDAY, NOVEMBER
H08 1800  1    23RD, 1961, AS THANKSGIVING DAY,
H08 1800  6       And so, let us remember on this day not only to
H08 1810  6    thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the
H08 1820  3    Pilgrims, but also to place our trust in Him that He
H08 1820 14    will continue to protect us in the future as He has
H08 1830 10    in the past.
H08 1830 13       IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand
H08 1840  9    and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this
H08 1850  8    21st day of November, in the year of Our Lord, one
H08 1860  5    thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence,
H08 1870  1    the one hundred and eighty-sixth. John A. Notte Jr.
