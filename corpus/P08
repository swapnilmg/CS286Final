P08 0010  1    Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys
P08 0010 11    beginning to study the Torah. Bits of trash lay in
P08 0020  9    the roadway. The air smelled warmish and foul.
P08 0030  4       A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked
P08 0040  2    toward us with quick strides. He wore a long double-breasted
P08 0050  1    coat of a heavy material, dark trousers, and black
P08 0050 10    boots with buckles. His black hat with its wide brim,
P08 0060  8    high crown, and fur trim rode high. With his head erect,
P08 0070  5    he approached, not glancing at us, and passed by with
P08 0080  3    his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead. He
P08 0080 12    had a pinkish-white complexion, a small straight nose,
P08 0090  6    a short black beard, and tightly curled paot. I was
P08 0100  6    suddenly conscious of my bare arms. The girls in the
P08 0110  4    market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered
P08 0110 12    their legs with cloth stockings. I turned and watched
P08 0120  9    him stride down the center of the road. His hands were
P08 0130  8    swinging at his sides, and he passed through the dingy
P08 0140  4    market place with his back straight and, pivoting on
P08 0150  2    his heel, he entered an old stone building.
P08 0150 10       Rachel had seen me watching the young man. She smiled.
P08 0160  8    "When your mother was here he must have been a young
P08 0170  7    boy. Like the ones you will see now".
P08 0180  1       I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding
P08 0180 11    along beside Rachel. She led me into a twisting side
P08 0190  9    alley. The dirty, discolored buildings looked boarded
P08 0200  4    up, and their few windows stood high above our heads.
P08 0210  3    Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most
P08 0220  1    of the buildings. We entered one where the front door
P08 0220 11    stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the
P08 0230  9    main floor. An old man with a white beard and dressed
P08 0240  5    in a long shabby coat, baggy trousers, and a black
P08 0250  2    skullcap greeted us. Rachel talked to him. He nodded,
P08 0250 11    clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch,
P08 0260  8    and flicked glances at me. I thought he would ask us
P08 0270  7    to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed, but
P08 0280  2    he looked down into his beard and preceded us down
P08 0280 12    the corridor. His toes pointed out toward the walls.
P08 0290  8    He stopped in front of a door, placed a finger on his
P08 0300  7    lips, and, still peering down into his beard, pushed
P08 0310  2    open the door to a classroom. We stepped inside. He
P08 0310 12    left us.
P08 0320  2       Little boys crowded together on long wooden benches,
P08 0320 10    and in the center of the room sat the teacher. His
P08 0330 11    black beard dripped down over the front of his coat.
P08 0340  7    One white hand poised a stick above his desk. He turned
P08 0350  4    his surly, half-closed eyes toward us, stared for a
P08 0360  2    second, then shouted in Yiddish, "One, two, three"!
P08 0360 10    rapping the stick against the desk. The little boys
P08 0370  9    shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation
P08 0380  3    of the Five Books of Moses, which they had previously
P08 0390  3    chanted in Hebrew. They chanted a fixed tune in time
P08 0400  1    to the report of the stick. Each boy opened his small
P08 0400 12    mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in
P08 0410  9    the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied
P08 0420  3    and prayed in the ghettos of Europe. The boys were
P08 0430  3    tiny. They had large bright eyes, the small upturned
P08 0430 12    noses of all babies everywhere, and hair cropped short
P08 0440  9    except for the long ringlets of paot framing their
P08 0450  5    little white faces. They bent over yellowed prayerbooks
P08 0460  3    and looked up only to watch the teacher. Since they
P08 0470  1    did not glance curiously at us once, I guessed that
P08 0470 11    there was a penalty for distraction. The guttural language
P08 0480  6    from the ghetto stopped. The teacher plunged the children
P08 0490  6    into a new portion, this time in Hebrew, rapping the
P08 0500  3    stick incessantly.
P08 0500  5       One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn
P08 0510  6    book had bright red hair and freckles. His tightly
P08 0520  1    curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders. In the
P08 0520 11    center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap.
P08 0530 10    His head barely rose above the table. I stared at him
P08 0540  9    for a long time. He did not return my interest. My
P08 0550  4    eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one
P08 0560  2    partially open window high above the little figures
P08 0560 10    and back to the boys. Some of them ignored the texts
P08 0580  8    and had apparently memorized the words long ago. They
P08 0590  5    singsonged the portion at the teacher, who accompanied
P08 0600  1    them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with
P08 0600 12    the stick. The tapping defined the rhythm and kept
P08 0610  8    the boys awake. I could not keep my eyes away from
P08 0620  7    the boy with the red hair. His body pitched back and
P08 0630  3    forth on the bench. His front teeth were missing.
P08 0640  1       I shuddered and backed out of the room. Rachel followed,
P08 0640 10    looked at me, and clucked with her tongue. We walked
P08 0650  8    down the cool hall silently. From behind us came the
P08 0660  6    rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of
P08 0670  2    the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid
P08 0670 13    study and prayer.
P08 0680  2       I said, "How long do they keep that up"?
P08 0690  1       "All day", she said. "Except for Shabbat, when they
P08 0690 10    are praying all day".
P08 0700  3       I rubbed my hands together. They had turned numb
P08 0710  2    and prickly in the classroom. The old man in the baggy
P08 0710 13    clothes waited at the foot of the steps. He glanced
P08 0720 10    down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish.
P08 0730  5       Rachel said, "He asks for money".
P08 0740  1       She passed by him. I reached into the pocket of
P08 0740 11    my skirt, fingered ten pruta, and dropped the coin.
P08 0750  8    Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old
P08 0760  8    man. He thanked me. I didn't look at him.
P08 0770  2       I grinned at Rachel. "Does this bother you"? I said.
P08 0780  2       She smiled to herself. "Most of our Sabras think
P08 0780 11    it's horrible. When we were fighting, a few of our
P08 0790 10    orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we
P08 0800  8    could not pass. They said that we must not fight but
P08 0810  4    wait for the Messiah".
P08 0810  8       I was amazed. You had to have convictions to lie
P08 0820  7    down in the road in all those clothes and appear as
P08 0830  3    though you might wish to turn yourself out of your
P08 0830 13    own home. You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.
P08 0840 10    And I wasn't. I was American. You had to know, also,
P08 0850  7    that you were going to fail. All of it might have been
P08 0860  6    heroic, but they had done it in the wrong place. I
P08 0870  2    resented them.
P08 0870  4       Rachel faced me. Her bright eyes were twinkling.
P08 0880  1    She said, "Sometimes I think they are keeping religion
P08 0880 10    for us while we play around. Your mother hated this
P08 0890 10    way of life. She wished to change much for the children
P08 0900  8    here".
P08 0900  9       I said quietly, respectfully, "What did she do here?
P08 0910  7    In this section"?
P08 0920  1       Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth. "Here,
P08 0930  8    nothing. But when she saw the children you have just
P08 0940  8    visited, she wanted to take them away and put them
P08 0950  4    out in the country, in the kibbutzim. She loved the
P08 0950 14    children. She was a strange woman, your mother. When
P08 0960  9    she loved, it was with a passion that drove her along
P08 0970  8    and carried along with her those things she loved.
P08 0980  4    Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted.
P08 0990  2    She stayed here to work for Aliah. For many immigrants,
P08 0990 12    for many children, the first thing they knew of Israel
P08 1000 10    and freedom was your mother. Sometimes it was dangerous
P08 1010  6    for her". Rachel grinned slyly. "But she loved danger.
P08 1020  5    She took it with her wherever she went; she chose it.
P08 1030  4    And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought
P08 1040  1    out helping other people. She was most strange woman.
P08 1040 10    Ready to follow her impulse. It was an impulse when
P08 1050  9    she was here in Me'a She'arim- I was with her- that
P08 1060  8    led her to stay in Israel. Your mother wanted to bring
P08 1070  5    children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos.
P08 1080  3    Here they did not need to be in ghettos. If she could
P08 1090  1    not take the children out of this section, at least
P08 1090 11    she could take other children out of their countries
P08 1100  6    and put them on the farms. She set out to make sure
P08 1110  5    that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live
P08 1120  2    in a place such as this".
P08 1120  8       I said quietly, gaining nerve, ready to ask any
P08 1130  5    question at all, no matter how intimate, ready to be
P08 1140  2    rebuffed, "Then why did she leave Israel? I'd like
P08 1140 11    to know that very much".
P08 1150  4       Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her
P08 1160  2    pace. The soles of her sandals reported sharply on
P08 1160 11    the cobblestones. She pursed her lips, then clamped
P08 1170  7    them together so tightly that I thought she was angry
P08 1180  6    with me. But she sighed and her face relaxed. "Trouble
P08 1190  2    came into her life. She had good friends here, people
P08 1200  1    who liked her. Who loved her. But she had to go out
P08 1200 13    and hurt herself. There was a man here in town. He
P08 1210  9    helped her meet people so she could go out and do the
P08 1230  6    work she wanted. She worked very hard. There was a
P08 1240  2    refugee who was able to come here because of her. He
P08 1240 13    came with his son. At first I thought they were relatives
P08 1250  9    of your mother, but it was not so. This refugee was
P08 1260  7    a middle-aged man, a big, handsome man with a strut
P08 1270  4    to his walk as I have never before seen. He had the
P08 1270 16    black numerals on his arm, so he had been branded in
P08 1280 11    a concentration camp. Yet he walked like a young man.
P08 1290  8    Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one.
P08 1300  6    Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the
P08 1310  2    direction of Europe. All his family was dead, except
P08 1310 11    for his son. Your mother would always retrieve him
P08 1320  7    when he wandered off, and she would send him home to
P08 1330  6    his son. He loved the son and was always glad to be
P08 1340  3    sent back to him. Then his son did something"- Rachel
P08 1340 13    threw up her hands- "I don't know what, but something,
P08 1350 10    to an official here- it was during the Mandate- and
P08 1360  7    the son was imprisoned. A few hours after the son was
P08 1370  7    arrested, your mother was informed. She ran from a
P08 1380  4    little group of us. We were sitting together, talking.
P08 1380 13    She went to the father and found he had hanged himself".
P08 1390 11    Rachel paused. It was silent in the stone alley. Then
P08 1400  9    she continued with energy, "I myself did not see her
P08 1410  7    until a week after she had run off to find the father.
P08 1420  3    No one saw her except the man Reuveni".
P08 1420 11       "Yes", I said. "I know him".
P08 1430  4       Rachel gave me a direct, bright-eyed look. She said,
P08 1440  4    "Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest
P08 1450  2    in this refugee. He said she would only hurt herself.
P08 1450 12    He complained to me once that I must talk to her. When
P08 1460 11    I did, she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni
P08 1470  7    wanted her to marry him. I asked her if she would,
P08 1480  5    and she said she would not. He had known when he first
P08 1490  3    helped her to meet the right people and work with them
P08 1490 14    that she did not intend to marry him. Anyway, I did
P08 1500 10    not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged
P08 1510  6    himself. She came to me one day. She was pale and skinny;
P08 1520  5    she was terribly alone. And she said that after this
P08 1530  2    man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni
P08 1530 14    and accepted his proposal. He shouted at her and told
P08 1540  9    her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had
P08 1550  5    upset herself. But now he was happy she would let him
P08 1560  4    straighten out her life and take care of her. He would
P08 1570  1    never let her harm herself again. For one whole week
P08 1570 11    he never let her stay alone. She let him lead her around.
P08 1580  9    He took her to a doctor, for she was run down, nervous,
P08 1590  7    did not care where she was. Reuveni took her with him
P08 1600  4    wherever he went. He did not let her talk to people;
P08 1610  1    he did not let her choose her own food. She was limp
P08 1610 13    and beaten from her loss; she did not care.
