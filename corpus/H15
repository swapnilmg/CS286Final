H15 0010  1       At the entrance side of the shelter, each roof beam
H15 0010 11    is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall.
H15 0020 10    The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks
H15 0030  5    on edge. The wooden bracing between the roof beams
H15 0040  2    is placed flush with the inside of the wall. Mortar
H15 0040 12    is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks
H15 0050  9    on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation
H15 0060  5    shielding. (For details see inset, fig. 5.)
H15 0070  2       The first one or two roof boards (marked "E" in
H15 0080  1    fig. 6) are slipped into place across the roof beams,
H15 0080 11    from outside the shelter. These boards are nailed to
H15 0090  8    the roof beams by reaching up through the open space
H15 0100  5    between the beams, from inside the shelter. Concrete
H15 0110  1    blocks are passed between the beams and put on the
H15 0110 11    boards. The roof blocks are in two layers and are not
H15 0120 10    mortared together.
H15 0130  1       Work on the roof continues in this way. The last
H15 0130 11    roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the
H15 0140  6    shelter.
H15 0140  7       When the roof blocks are all in place, the final
H15 0150  7    rows of wall blocks are mortared into position. The
H15 0160  2    structure is complete. (See fig. 7.) Building plans
H15 0160 10    are on page 21.
H15 0170  4       Solid concrete blocks, relatively heavy and dense,
H15 0180  1    are used for this shelter. These blocks are sold in
H15 0180 11    various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block
H15 0190 10    to fit.
H15 0190 12       Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks
H15 0200  6    would have to be filled with concrete to give effective
H15 0210  4    protection.
H15 0210  5       Bricks are an alternative. If they are used, the
H15 0220  6    walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the
H15 0230  2    same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks.
H15 0230 11       The illustrations in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete
H15 0240 11    block wall. More detailed instructions may be obtained
H15 0250  6    from your local building supply houses and craftsmen.

H15 0310  1    _ABOVEGROUND DOUBLE-WALL SHELTER_
H15 0310  1       An outdoor, aboveground fallout shelter also may
H15 0310  8    be built with concrete blocks. (See fig. 9, double-wall
H15 0320  7    shelter.) Most people would have to hire a contractor
H15 0330  6    to build this shelter. Plans are on pages 22 and 23.
H15 0340  4       This shelter could be built in regions where water
H15 0350  1    or rock is close to the surface, making it impractical
H15 0350 11    to build an underground shelter.
H15 0360  2       Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at
H15 0370  2    least 20 inches apart. The space between them is filled
H15 0370 12    with pit-run gravel or earth. The walls are held together
H15 0380  9    with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls
H15 0390  8    are built.
H15 0390 10       The roof shown here (fig. 9) is a 6-inch slab of
H15 0400  9    reinforced concrete, covered with at least 20 inches
H15 0410  4    of pit-run gravel. An alternate roof, perhaps more
H15 0420  1    within do-it-yourself reach, could be constructed of
H15 0420 10    heavy wooden roof beams, overlaid with boards and waterproofing.
H15 0430  7    It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches
H15 0440  6    of pit-run gravel.
H15 0440 10       The materials for a double-wall shelter would cost
H15 0450  8    about $700. Contractors' charges would be additional.
H15 0460  4    The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection.
H15 0470  2    _PRE-SHAPED METAL SHELTER_
H15 0470  6       Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast
H15 0480  6    concrete can be used for shelters either above or below
H15 0490  4    ground. These are particularly suitable for regions
H15 0490 11    where water or rock is close to the surface. They form
H15 0500 11    effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth,
H15 0510  7    as shown in figure 10.
H15 0520  1       Materials for this shelter would cost about $700.
H15 0520  8    A contractor probably would be required to help build
H15 0530  7    it. His charges would be added to the cost of materials.
H15 0540  5    This shelter, as shown on page 24, would provide almost
H15 0550  2    absolute protection from fallout radiation. An alternate
H15 0560  1    hatchway entrance, shown on page 25, would reduce the
H15 0560 10    cost of materials $50 to $100.
H15 0570  4       The National Lumber Manufacturers Association, Washington,
H15 0580  2    D. C., is developing plans to utilize specially treated
H15 0590  2    lumber for underground shelter construction. The Structural
H15 0600  1    Clay Products Institute, Washington, D.C., is working
H15 0600  8    to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter
H15 0610  8    construction.
H15 0620  1    _UNDERGROUND CONCRETE SHELTER_
H15 0620  3       An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be
H15 0630  3    built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500, depending
H15 0640  1    on the type of entrance. The shelter shown would provide
H15 0640 11    almost absolute fallout protection.
H15 0650  3       The illustration (fig. 11) shows this shelter with
H15 0660  3    the roof at ground level and mounded over. The same
H15 0660 13    shelter could be built into an embankment or below
H15 0670  9    ground level. Plans for the shelter, with either a
H15 0680  7    stairway or hatchway entrance, are shown on pages 26
H15 0690  4    and 27.
H15 0690  6       Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout
H15 0700  2    protection can be built as an added room to the basement
H15 0710  1    of a home under construction. It would add about $500
H15 0710 11    to the total cost of the home. The shelter illustrated
H15 0720  8    in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new
H15 0730  7    home in the Washington, D.C. area in the Spring of
H15 0740  3    1959.
H15 0740  4       IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS common to each type of
H15 0750  5    shelter are:
H15 0750  7    _1._
H15 0750  8       Arrangement of the entrance.
H15 0760  1    _2._
H15 0760  2       Ventilation.
H15 0760  3    _3._
H15 0760  4       Radio reception.
H15 0760  6    _4._
H15 0760  7       Lighting.
H15 0770  1       THE ENTRANCE must have at least one right-angle
H15 0770 10    turn. Radiation scatters somewhat like light. Some
H15 0780  7    will go around a corner. The rest continues in a straight
H15 0790  7    line. Therefore, sharp turns in a shelter entrance
H15 0800  5    will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter.
H15 0810  1       VENTILATION is provided in a concrete block basement
H15 0820  1    shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance.
H15 0820 12    A blower may be installed to increase comfort.
H15 0830  7       A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter
H15 0840  6    and for the underground shelters. It should provide
H15 0850  2    not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person.
H15 0850 14    Vent pipes also are necessary (as shown in figs. 9,
H15 0860 10    10, and 11), but filters are not.
H15 0870  4       RADIO RECEPTION is cut down by the shielding necessary
H15 0880  3    to keep out radiation. As soon as the shelter is completed
H15 0890  2    a radio reception check must be made. It probably will
H15 0890 12    be necessary to install an outside antenna, particularly
H15 0900  8    to receive CONELRAD broadcasts.
H15 0910  2       LIGHTING is an important consideration. Continuous
H15 0920  3    low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by
H15 0930  3    means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired
H15 0930 15    a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb. Tests have
H15 0940  6    shown that such a device, with a fresh battery, will
H15 0950  6    furnish light continuously for at least 10 days. With
H15 0960  4    a spare battery, a source of light for 2 weeks or more
H15 0970  1    would be assured. A flashlight or electric lantern
H15 0970  9    also should be available for those periods when a brighter
H15 0980  7    light is needed. There should be a regular electrical
H15 0990  5    outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many
H15 1000  3    areas.
H15 1000  4       OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.- If there are outside windows
H15 1010  4    in the basement corner where you build a shelter, they
H15 1020  2    should be shielded as shown in the Appendix, page 29.
H15 1020 12    Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency
H15 1030  8    threatens. Basement walls that project above the ground
H15 1040  7    should be shielded as shown in the Appendix, page 29.
H15 1050  4       In these shelters the entrance should be not more
H15 1060  3    than 2 feet wide. Bunks, or materials to build them,
H15 1060 13    may have to be put inside the enclosure before the
H15 1070  9    shelter walls are completed.
H15 1080  1       The basement or belowground shelters also will serve
H15 1080  9    for tornado or hurricane protection.
H15 1090  4    #III. LIVING IN A SHELTER#
H15 1090  9    @ The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first.
H15 1110  8    Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation
H15 1120  7    intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an
H15 1130  6    hour after the explosion. But the radiation may be
H15 1140  2    so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely
H15 1140 13    dangerous.
H15 1150  1       Therefore, civil defense instructions received over
H15 1150  7    CONELRAD or by other means should be followed. A battery-powered
H15 1170  1    radio is essential. Radiation instruments suitable
H15 1170  7    for home use are available, and would be of value in
H15 1180  8    locating that portion of the home which offers the
H15 1190  4    best protection against fallout radiation. There is
H15 1200  1    a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in
H15 1200 10    radiation meters may become available. One instrument
H15 1210  6    thus would serve both purposes.
H15 1220  1       Your local civil defense will gather its own information
H15 1220 10    and will receive broad information from State and Federal
H15 1230  9    sources. It will tell you as soon as possible:
H15 1240  8       How long to stay in your shelter.
H15 1250  2       How soon you may go outdoors.
H15 1250  8       How long you may stay outside.
H15 1260  4       You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full
H15 1270  2    time for at least several days and to make it your
H15 1270 13    home for 14 days or longer. A checklist in the Appendix,
H15 1280  9    (page 30) tells what is needed. Families with children
H15 1290  5    will have particular problems. They should provide
H15 1300  3    for simple recreation.
H15 1300  6       There should be a task for everyone and these tasks
H15 1310  6    should be rotated. Part of the family should be sleeping
H15 1320  3    while the rest is awake.
H15 1320  8       To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent
H15 1330  7    tasks that will keep the family busy. Records such
H15 1340  3    as diaries can be kept.
H15 1340  8       The survival of the family will depend largely on
H15 1350  5    information received by radio. A record should be kept
H15 1360  3    of the information and instructions, including the
H15 1360 10    time and date of broadcast.
H15 1370  4       Family rationing probably will be necessary.
H15 1380  1       Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular
H15 1380  9    schedule. There will come a time in a basement shelter
H15 1390 10    when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use
H15 1400  7    of the whole basement. However, as much time as possible
H15 1410  5    should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation
H15 1420  1    exposure to a minimum.
H15 1420  5       The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter
H15 1430  4    will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied. Food,
H15 1430 14    medical supplies, utensils, and equipment, if not already
H15 1440  8    stored in the shelter, must be quickly gathered up
H15 1450  7    and carried into it.
H15 1450 11       After the family has settled in the shelter, the
H15 1460  9    housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult
H15 1470  7    in charge.
H15 1470  9       Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter
H15 1480  5    will require much thought and planning.
H15 1490  1       Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal
H15 1490  8    of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem. A covered
H15 1500  9    container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as
H15 1510  6    a toilet. A 10-gallon garbage can, with a tightly fitting
H15 1520  4    cover, could be used to keep the wastes until it is
H15 1530  2    safe to leave the shelter.
H15 1530  7       Water rationing will be difficult and should be
H15 1540  4    planned carefully.
H15 1540  6       A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters
H15 1550  5    in cold climates. It would take the chill from the
H15 1560  2    shelter in the beginning. Even if the electric power
H15 1560 11    fails after an attack, any time that the heater has
H15 1570  9    been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable.
H15 1580  5    Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the
H15 1590  5    temperature. Warm clothing and bedding, of course,
H15 1600  1    are essential.
H15 1600  3       Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided.
H15 1610  1    A flame would use up air.
H15 1610  7       Some families already have held weekend rehearsals
H15 1620  3    in their home shelters to learn the problems and to
H15 1630  1    determine for themselves what supplies they would need.
H15 1630  9    #IV. IF AN ATTACK FINDS YOU WITHOUT A PREPARED SHELTER#
H15 1640  9    @ Few areas, if any, are as good as prepared shelters
H15 1650  7    but they are worth knowing about.
H15 1660  1       A family dwelling without a basement provides some
H15 1660  9    natural shielding from fallout radiation. On the ground
H15 1670  7    floor the radiation would be about half what it is
H15 1680  7    outside. The best protection would be on the ground
H15 1690  3    floor in the central part of the house.
H15 1690 11       A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation
H15 1700  7    to one-tenth of the outside level. The safest place
H15 1710  5    is the basement corner least exposed to windows and
H15 1720  2    deepest below ground.
H15 1720  5       If there is time after the warning, the basement
H15 1730  3    shielding could be improved substantially by blocking
H15 1740  1    windows with bricks, dirt, books, magazines, or other
H15 1740  9    heavy material.
H15 1750  1    #V. SHELTER IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS#
H15 1750  6    @ Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete
H15 1760  5    provide better natural shelter than the usual family
H15 1770  2    dwellings. In general, such apartments afford more
H15 1770  9    protection than smaller buildings because their walls
H15 1780  7    are thick and there is more space.
H15 1790  3       The central area of the ground floor of a heavily
H15 1800  1    constructed apartment building, with concrete floors,
H15 1800  7    should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary
H15 1810  7    basement of a family dwelling. The basement of such
H15 1820  5    an apartment building may provide as much natural protection
H15 1830  2    as the specially constructed concrete block shelter
H15 1830  9    recommended for the basement of a family dwelling.
H15 1840  8       The Federal Government is aiding local governments
H15 1850  6    in several places to survey residential, commercial
H15 1860  2    and industrial buildings to determine what fallout
H15 1870  1    protection they would provide, and for how many people.
H15 1870 10       The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily
H15 1880  9    to plan the use of existing space. Such planning will
H15 1890  7    require the cooperation of other occupants and of the
H15 1900  5    apartment management.
