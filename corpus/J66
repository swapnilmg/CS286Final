J66 0010  1    Critically invisible, modern revolt, like X-rays and
J66 0010  9    radioactivity, is perceived only by its effects at
J66 0020  8    more materialistic social levels, where it is called
J66 0030  4    delinquency.
J66 0030  5       "Disaffiliation", by the way, is the term used by
J66 0040  6    the critic and poet, Lawrence Lipton, who has written
J66 0050  2    several articles on this subject, the first of which,
J66 0050 11    in the Nation, quoted as epigraph, "We disaffiliate
J66 0060  7    ..."- John L. Lewis.
J66 0070  2       Like the pillars of Hercules, like two ruined Titans
J66 0080  1    guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles, stand
J66 0080 10    two great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of
J66 0090  8    the post-war generation: the great saxophonist, Charlie
J66 0100  5    Parker, and Dylan Thomas. If the word deliberate means
J66 0110  5    anything, both of them certainly deliberately destroyed
J66 0120  2    themselves.
J66 0120  3       Both of them were overcome by the horror of the
J66 0130  3    world in which they found themselves, because at last
J66 0130 12    they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon
J66 0140 10    of a purely lyrical art. Both of them were my friends.
J66 0150  8    Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to
J66 0160  5    see them with a perspective which was not distorted
J66 0170  1    by exasperation or fatigue. So as the years passed,
J66 0170 10    I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated
J66 0180  9    personal conflagration.
J66 0190  1       The last time I saw Bird, at Jimbo's Bob City, he
J66 0190 12    was so gone- so blind to the world- that he literally
J66 0200 11    sat down on me before he realized I was there. "What
J66 0210  6    happened, man"? I said, referring to the pretentious
J66 0220  4    "Jazz Concert". "Evil, man, evil", he said, and that's
J66 0230  4    all he said for the rest of the night. About dawn he
J66 0240  2    got up to blow. The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness
J66 0240 12    and the fluent melody spiraled through it.
J66 0250  5       The last time I saw Dylan, his self-destruction
J66 0260  4    had not just passed the limits of rationality. It had
J66 0270  2    assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter.
J66 0270  9    Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent
J66 0280 10    of falling stones.
J66 0290  1       Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great
J66 0290 10    deal more in common than the same disastrous end. As
J66 0300  7    artists, they were very similar. They were both very
J66 0310  5    fluent. But this fluent, enchanting utterance had,
J66 0320  1    compared with important artists of the past, relatively
J66 0320  9    little content. Neither of them got very far beyond
J66 0330  8    a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity.
J66 0340  5    The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence
J66 0350  3    of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation.
J66 0360  1    Music, of course, is not so explicit an art, but anybody
J66 0360 12    who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the
J66 0370  9    same way about his own gift. Both of them did communicate
J66 0380  7    one central theme: Against the ruin of the world, there
J66 0390  6    is only one defense- the creative act. This, of course,
J66 0400  3    is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry. It is
J66 0410  1    the theme of Horace, who certainly otherwise bears
J66 0410  9    little resemblance to Parker or Thomas. The difference
J66 0420  7    is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken
J66 0430  6    assurance. To Dylan and Bird it was an agony and terror.
J66 0440  3    I do not believe that this is due to anything especially
J66 0450  1    frightful about their relationship to their own creativity.
J66 0450  9    I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic
J66 0460  9    world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole
J66 0470  6    value. Horace's column of imperishable verse shines
J66 0480  3    quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome. Art
J66 0490  1    may have been for him the most enduring, orderly, and
J66 0490 11    noble activity of man. But the other activities of
J66 0500  8    his life partook of these values. They did not actively
J66 0510  5    negate them. Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance
J66 0520  3    in a world of burning cities and burning Jews. He was
J66 0530  1    able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the
J66 0530 14    answer to air raids and gas ovens. As the world began
J66 0540  9    to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas
J66 0550  5    oven, I believe his art became meaningless to him.
J66 0560  1    I think all this could apply to Parker just as well,
J66 0560 12    although, because of the nature of music, it is not
J66 0570  9    demonstrable- at least not conclusively.
J66 0580  2       Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme,
J66 0590  1    attitude, life pattern. In the practice of their art,
J66 0590 10    there is an obvious technical resemblance. Contrary
J66 0600  5    to popular belief, they were not great technical innovators.
J66 0610  5    Their effects are only superficially startling. Thomas
J66 0620  3    is a regression from the technical originality and
J66 0630  1    ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire.
J66 0630  9    Similarly, the innovations of bop, and of Parker particularly,
J66 0640  9    have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with
J66 0650  6    music, especially by that ignoramus, the intellectual
J66 0660  3    jitterbug, the jazz aficionado. The tonal novelties
J66 0670  1    consist in the introduction of a few chords used in
J66 0670 11    classical music for centuries. And there is less rhythmic
J66 0680  8    difference between progressive jazz, no matter how
J66 0690  5    progressive, and Dixieland, than there is between two
J66 0700  3    movements of many conventional symphonies.
J66 0700  8       What Parker and his contemporaries- Gillespie, Davis,
J66 0710  6    Monk, Roach (Tristano is an anomaly), etc.- did was
J66 0720  7    to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz
J66 0730  5    into the basic structure, of which it then became an
J66 0740  2    integral part, and with which it then developed. This
J66 0740 11    is true of the melodic line which could be put together
J66 0750 10    from selected passages of almost anybody- Benny Carter,
J66 0760  6    Johnny Hodges. It is true of the rhythmic pattern in
J66 0770  5    which the beat shifts continuously, or at least is
J66 0780  2    continuously sprung, so that it becomes ambiguous enough
J66 0780 10    to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations
J66 0790 10    of the phrase or strophe. This is exactly what happened
J66 0800  7    in the transition from baroque to rococo music. It
J66 0810  5    is the difference between Bach and Mozart.
J66 0820  1       It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this
J66 0820 11    is what Thomas did to poetry. The special syntactical
J66 0830  7    effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell- actually
J66 0840  2    ornaments- become the main concern. The metaphysical
J66 0850  1    conceits, which fascinate the Reactionary Generation
J66 0850  7    still dominant in backwater American colleges, were
J66 0860  7    embroideries. Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are
J66 0870  5    ends in themselves. The immediate theme, if it exists,
J66 0880  5    is incidental, and his main theme- the terror of birth-
J66 0890  1    is simply reiterated.
J66 0890  4       This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which
J66 0900  5    should be pointed out. Again, contrary to popular belief,
J66 0910  2    there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either
J66 0910 11    musically or emotionally. His sinuous melody is a sort
J66 0920  9    of nai^ve transcendence of all experience. Emotionally
J66 0930  5    it does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner; it resembles
J66 0940  5    Mozart. This is true also of a painter like Jackson
J66 0950  3    Pollock. He may have been eccentric in his behavior,
J66 0960  1    but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles.
J66 0960 10    Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal
J66 0970  8    communication. The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the
J66 0980  3    general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic
J66 0990  2    poetry. It is much more a personal difference. Thomas
J66 0990 11    certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and
J66 1000  9    disorder of the world. Parker and Pollock wanted to
J66 1010  6    substitute a work of art for the world.
J66 1020  1       Technique pure and simple, rendition, is not of
J66 1020  9    major importance, but it is interesting that Parker,
J66 1030  7    following Lester Young, was one of the leaders of the
J66 1040  7    so-called saxophone revolution. In modern jazz, the
J66 1050  3    saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with
J66 1050 12    conventional embouchure. Metrically, Thomas's verse
J66 1060  5    was extremely conventional, as was, incidentally, the
J66 1070  5    verse of that other tragic enrage, Hart Crane.
J66 1080  2       I want to make clear what I consider the one technical
J66 1090  1    development in the first wave of significant post-war
J66 1090 10    arts. Ornament is confabulation in the interstices
J66 1100  6    of structure. A poem by Dylan Thomas, a saxophone solo
J66 1110  5    by Charles Parker, a painting by Jackson Pollock- these
J66 1120  2    are pure confabulations as ends in themselves. Confabulation
J66 1130  1    has come to determine structure. Uninhibited lyricism
J66 1130  8    should be distinguished from its exact opposite- the
J66 1140  8    sterile, extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals,
J66 1150  7    or present blight of poetic professors.
J66 1160  2       Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone
J66 1170  1    except very reactionary writers- like Allen Tate, for
J66 1170  9    instance, to whom Valery was the last word in modern
J66 1180 10    poetry and the felicities of an Apollinaire, let alone
J66 1190  6    a Paul Eluard were nonsense- so Dylan Thomas's influence
J66 1200  3    has been slight indeed. In fact, his only disciple-
J66 1210  1    the only person to imitate his style- was W. S. Graham,
J66 1220  1    who seems to have imitated him without much understanding,
J66 1220 10    and who has since moved on to other methods. Thomas's
J66 1230 10    principal influence lay in the communication of an
J66 1240  7    attitude- that of the now extinct British romantic
J66 1250  3    school of the New Apocalypse- Henry Treece, J. F. Hendry,
J66 1260  3    and others- all of whom were quite conventional poets.
J66 1270  2       Parker certainly had much more of an influence.
J66 1270 10    At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone
J66 1280  9    player in every high school band in America to blow
J66 1290  6    like Bird. Even before his death this influence had
J66 1300  2    begun to ebb. In fact, the whole generation of the
J66 1300 12    founding fathers of bop- Gillespie, Monk, Davis, Blakey,
J66 1310  8    and the rest- are just now at a considerable discount.
J66 1320  8    The main line of development today goes back to Lester
J66 1330  6    Young and by-passes them.
J66 1330 11       The point is that many of the most impressive developments
J66 1340  9    in the arts nowadays are aberrant, idiosyncratic. There
J66 1350  5    is no longer any sense of continuing development of
J66 1360  3    the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard,
J66 1370  2    or for that matter, from Hawthorne through Henry James
J66 1370 11    to Gertrude Stein. The cubist generation before World
J66 1380  8    War I, and, on a lower level, the surrealists of
J66 1390  8    the period between the wars, both assumed an accepted
J66 1400  4    universe of discourse, in which, to quote Andre Breton,
J66 1410  2    it was possible to make definite advances, exactly
J66 1410 10    as in the sciences. I doubt if anyone holds such ideas
J66 1420  9    today. Continuity exits, but like the neo-swing music
J66 1430  7    developed from Lester Young, it is a continuity sustained
J66 1440  4    by popular demand.
J66 1440  7       In the plastic arts, a very similar situation exists.
J66 1450  6    Surrealists like Hans Arp and Max Ernst might talk
J66 1460  4    of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by walking
J66 1470  2    on them with painted soles, or by tossing bits of paper
J66 1470 13    up in the air. But it is obvious that they were self-deluded.
J66 1480 12    Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but
J66 1490  9    another Ernst or Arp. Nothing looks less like their
J66 1500  5    work than the happenings of random occasion. Many of
J66 1510  3    the post-World War II abstract expressionists, apostles
J66 1520  1    of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard, look alike,
J66 1520 10    and do look like accidents. The aesthetic appeal of
J66 1530  7    pure paint laid on at random may exist, but it is a
J66 1540  7    very impoverished appeal. Once again what has happened
J66 1550  2    is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals,
J66 1550 10    the accidents of painting. It is curious that at its
J66 1560  9    best, the work of this school of painting- Mark Rothko,
J66 1570  6    Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell,
J66 1580  3    Willem de-Kooning, and the rest- resembles nothing
J66 1590  2    so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive
J66 1590 11    painters: the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background
J66 1600  9    of a Henry McFee, itself a formula derived from Renoir;
J66 1610  7    the splashes of light and black which fake drapery
J66 1620  5    in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent. Often
J66 1630  2    work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the
J66 1630 11    pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute
J66 1640  9    painteresque values. You have only to compare such
J66 1650  7    painting with the work of, say, Sesshu, to realize
J66 1660  4    that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.
J66 1670  1       At its best the abstract expressionists achieve
J66 1670  8    a simple rococo decorative surface. Its poverty shows
J66 1680  6    up immediately when compared with Tiepolo, where the
J66 1690  5    rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity
J66 1700  1    and power. A Tiepolo painting, however confabulated,
J66 1700  8    is a universe of tensions in vast depths. A Pollock
J66 1710  9    is an object of art- bijouterie- disguised only by
J66 1720  7    its great size. In fact, once the size is big enough
J66 1730  4    to cover a whole wall, it turns into nothing more than
J66 1740  1    extremely expensive wallpaper. Now there is nothing
J66 1740  8    wrong with complicated wallpaper. There is just more
J66 1750  6    to Tiepolo. The great Ashikaga brush painters painted
J66 1760  4    wallpapers, too- at least portable ones, screens.
J66 1770  2       A process of elimination which leaves the artist
J66 1770 10    with nothing but the play of his materials themselves
J66 1780  9    cannot sustain interest in either artist or public
J66 1790  6    for very long. So, in the last couple of years, abstract
J66 1800  4    expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion-
J66 1810  3    indications of landscape or living figures.
