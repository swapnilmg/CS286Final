F21 0010  1       A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide,
F21 0010 11    an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous
F21 0020  8    of all was launched by the explosion of the island
F21 0030  5    of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific at
F21 0040  2    300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and
F21 0040 12    Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded
F21 0050 10    the shore as far away as San Francisco.
F21 0060  4       The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic
F21 0070  1    inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale
F21 0070 10    of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics
F21 0080  9    concede that the myth may have some foundation in a
F21 0090  7    great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed, a tremendously
F21 0100  3    destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in
F21 0110  2    1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and
F21 0110 11    archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.
F21 0120  8       One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed
F21 0130  5    the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755; its
F21 0140  4    waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away
F21 0150  1    as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in
F21 0150 10    the Atlantic Ocean; they are far more common in the
F21 0160  9    Pacific. Japan has had 15 destructive ones (eight of
F21 0170  5    them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian Islands are
F21 0180  3    struck severely an average of once every 25 years.
F21 0190  1       In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so
F21 0190 10    huge that they piled into the Inland Sea; one wave
F21 0200  7    swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay.
F21 0210  5    A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away
F21 0220  3    an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn
F21 0220 11    trees standing where the community had been. In 1896
F21 0230  9    a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away
F21 0240  6    10,000 homes.
F21 0240  8       The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual
F21 0250  8    standards of measurement. An ordinary sea wave is rarely
F21 0260  5    more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest-
F21 0270  1    no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet
F21 0270 12    in the Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than
F21 0280  9    100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest
F21 0290  8    to crest. While a wind wave never travels at more than
F21 0300  5    60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in the
F21 0310  2    open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per
F21 0310 12    hour. The greater the depth of the water, the greater
F21 0320  8    is the speed of the wave; Lagrange's law says that
F21 0330  5    its velocity is equal to the square root of the product
F21 0340  3    of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.
F21 0340 12    In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach
F21 0350 10    a speed of 500 miles per hour.
F21 0360  3       Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their
F21 0360 11    length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.
F21 0370 10    Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet
F21 0380  8    from trough to crest. Usually it is only when they
F21 0390  5    approach shallow water on the shore that they build
F21 0400  1    up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day
F21 0400 10    in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan, fishermen
F21 0410  6    at sea noticed no unusual swells. Not until they sailed
F21 0420  5    home at the end of the day, through a sea strewn with
F21 0430  3    bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware
F21 0430 12    of what had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had
F21 0440  8    crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon
F21 0450  8    beaches crowded with bathers, drowning thousands of
F21 0460  3    them and flattening villages along the shore.
F21 0460 10       The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores
F21 0470  9    than on steep ones. They usually range from 20 to 60
F21 0480  7    feet in height, but when they pour into a V-shaped
F21 0490  4    inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.
F21 0500  1       Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather
F21 0500 11    sharp swell, not different enough from an ordinary
F21 0510  7    wave to alarm casual observers. This is followed by
F21 0520  5    a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the
F21 0530  3    first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and
F21 0530 12    dry, and the beaches are covered with stranded fish.
F21 0540  8    At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect
F21 0550  7    the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach. Many of
F21 0560  3    them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for
F21 0560 12    some minutes later the first giant wave roared over
F21 0570  9    the shore. After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people
F21 0580  6    on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary
F21 0590  4    ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground.
F21 0600  2    When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach,
F21 0610  1    fearing that they might be buried under landslides.
F21 0610  9    Just as they reached the shore, the first huge wave
F21 0620  7    crashed upon them.
F21 0620 10       A tsunami is not a single wave but a series. The
F21 0630 10    waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an
F21 0640  6    hour or more (because of their great length), and this
F21 0650  3    has often lulled people into thinking after the first
F21 0650 12    great wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves
F21 0660 11    may keep coming for many hours. Usually the third to
F21 0670  6    the eighth waves in the series are the biggest.
F21 0680  2       Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo
F21 0680 11    was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of
F21 0690  9    Oceanography, one of the world's foremost marine geologists.
F21 0700  8    He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves.
F21 0710  7    Their onrush and retreat, he reported, was accompanied
F21 0720  3    by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The third
F21 0730  2    and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some
F21 0730 12    of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently; they
F21 0740  8    were steepest on the shores facing the direction of
F21 0750  6    the seaquake from which the waves had come. In Hilo
F21 0760  3    Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest
F21 0760 14    waves, 55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.
F21 0770  7       Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen
F21 0780  4    strange by-products of the phenomenon. During a 1933
F21 0790  3    tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night.
F21 0790 12    The luminosity of the water is now believed to have
F21 0800 10    been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the
F21 0810  7    luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence
F21 0820  4    of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed
F21 0830  2    that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami
F21 0830 12    have enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed
F21 0840  8    vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the
F21 0850  8    surface by the disturbance. The waves of a 1923 tsunami
F21 0860  6    in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to
F21 0870  3    death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at
F21 0870 12    a depth of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them
F21 0880  8    in by the thousands.
F21 0890  1       The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946
F21 0890  9    disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious
F21 0900  9    instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the
F21 0910  8    Coast and Geodetic Survey staff. It consists of a series
F21 0920  6    of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record
F21 0930  3    the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water
F21 0940  1    tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period
F21 0940 10    of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the
F21 0950  8    ocean, they set in motion a corresponding oscillation
F21 0960  2    in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.
F21 0970  1    This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers
F21 0970 11    at the station that a tsunami is in progress. Such
F21 0980  9    equipment has been installed at Hilo, Midway, Attu
F21 0990  5    and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm goes off, information
F21 1000  4    is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which is the
F21 1010  3    center of the warning system.
F21 1010  8       This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes
F21 1020  5    from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which
F21 1030  3    are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary
F21 1040  1    determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts
F21 1040 10    tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By
F21 1050  9    means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths
F21 1060  6    in the ocean at various locations, it is possible to
F21 1070  3    estimate the rate of approach and probable time of
F21 1070 12    arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at
F21 1080 10    any spot in the Pacific. The civil and military authorities
F21 1090  6    are then advised of the danger, and they issue warnings
F21 1100  5    and take all necessary protective steps. All of these
F21 1110  3    activities are geared to a top-priority communication
F21 1110 11    system, and practice tests have been held to assure
F21 1120  9    that everything will work smoothly.
F21 1130  2       Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami
F21 1140  1    in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence.
F21 1140 11    On November 4, 1952, an earthquake occurred under the
F21 1150  7    sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula. At 17:07 that afternoon
F21 1160  5    (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded by the seismograph
F21 1170  4    alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately went
F21 1180  2    into action. Within about an hour with the help of
F21 1180 12    reports from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and
F21 1190  8    California, the quake's epicenter was placed at 51
F21 1200  6    degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude.
F21 1210  3    While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came
F21 1220  1    in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported
F21 1220 10    it was covered with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian
F21 1230  8    station made its calculations and notified the military
F21 1240  5    services and the police that the first big wave would
F21 1250  3    arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.
F21 1250 10       It turned out that the waves were not so high as
F21 1260 11    in 1946. They hurled a cement barge against a freighter
F21 1270  6    in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone lines, marooned
F21 1280  3    automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows. But not
F21 1290  3    a single human life was lost, and property damage in
F21 1290 13    the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000. There
F21 1300  7    is little doubt that the warning system saved lives
F21 1310  5    and reduced the damage.
F21 1310  9       But it is plain that a warning system, however efficient,
F21 1320  8    is not enough. In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific
F21 1330  6    there should be restrictions against building homes
F21 1340  3    on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they
F21 1350  1    be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly
F21 1350 10    against waves.
F21 1360  1    ##
F21 1360  2    The key to the world of geology is change; nothing
F21 1360 12    remains the same. Life has evolved from simple combinations
F21 1370  8    of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in
F21 1380  6    man. The land, too, is changing, and earthquakes are
F21 1390  3    daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements
F21 1400  1    in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes
F21 1400 10    this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground
F21 1410  7    surface; often the shifts cannot be seen, but they
F21 1420  6    are there; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier
F21 1430  3    breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are
F21 1430 10    most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness
F21 1440  8    is presently concentrated, but scars of the past show
F21 1450  7    that there is no part of the earth that has not had
F21 1460  5    them.
F21 1460  6       The effects of earthquakes on civilization have
F21 1470  2    been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role
F21 1470  9    of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole
F21 1480  9    cities is tremendously frightening, but fire may actually
F21 1490  6    be the principal agent in a particular disaster. Superstition
F21 1500  3    has often blended with fact to color reports.
F21 1510  1       We have learned from earthquakes much of what we
F21 1510 10    now know about the earth's interior, for they send
F21 1520  8    waves through the earth which emerge with information
F21 1530  5    about the materials through which they have traveled.
F21 1540  3    These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface
F21 1550  1    a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid
F21 1550 13    inner core.
F21 1560  1       Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below
F21 1560  9    the surface, but they do not occur at greater depths.
F21 1570  9    Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts. (1)
F21 1580  6    As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material
F21 1590  3    should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself
F21 1590 13    to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by
F21 1600  9    breaking, as rigid surface rocks do. (2) If earthquakes
F21 1610  6    do occur at such depths, why not deeper?
F21 1620  1       Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves
F21 1620  7    has been applied in various fields. In the search for
F21 1630  9    oil and gas, we make similar waves under controlled
F21 1640  5    conditions with dynamite and learn from them where
F21 1650  3    there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation
F21 1660  1    of these resources. We have also developed techniques
F21 1660  9    for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests
F21 1670  6    through the waves in the ground which they generate.
F21 1680  5       The following discussion of this subject has been
F21 1690  3    adapted from the book Causes of Catastrophe by L. Don
F21 1700  3    Leet.
F21 1700  4    #THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR#
F21 1700 10    At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday,
F21 1710  9    April 18, 1906, San Francisco was shaken by a severe
F21 1720  8    earthquake. A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky
F21 1730  6    roll.
