H03 0010  1       You have heard him tell these young people that
H03 0010 10    during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress
H03 0020  8    he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis,
H03 0030  6    the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs, come and go
H03 0040  4    and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation
H03 0050  1    that mankind has ever known. Then I have seen the pride
H03 0050 12    of country well in the eyes of these young people.
H03 0060  9       So, I say, Mr. Speaker, God bless you and keep you
H03 0070  7    for many years not only for this body but for the United
H03 0080  5    States of America and the free world. You remember
H03 0090  1    the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago, when
H03 0090 12    someone asked him when he was in Canada, and Dean Rusk
H03 0100 11    was in Europe, and Vice President JOHNSON was in Asia,
H03 0110  7    "Who is running the store"? and he said "The same fellow
H03 0120  8    who has been running it, SAM RAYBURN".
H03 0130  2    #GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND#
H03 0140  1    _MR. MCCORMACK._
H03 0140  1       Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members
H03 0140 10    who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this
H03 0150 10    point in the RECORD; and also that they may have 5
H03 0160  8    legislative days in which to extend their remarks.
H03 0170  3    _THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE._
H03 0170  7       Is there objection to the request of the gentleman
H03 0180  7    from Massachusetts?
H03 0180  9       There was no objection.
H03 0190  3    #REMARKS OF HON. JOSEPH P. ADDABBO OF NEW YORK#
H03 0200  1    _MR. ADDABBO._
H03 0200  3       It is notably significant that so many Members from
H03 0210  2    both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration
H03 0210 12    for our beloved Speaker, the Honorable SAM RAYBURN.
H03 0220  8    I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction
H03 0230  7    of saying that he was from the State of Texas. I did
H03 0240  7    so because I agree with so many here today, that he
H03 0250  4    is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United
H03 0260  1    States. For the dignity, the influence, and the power
H03 0260 10    of the legislative branch of our Government- it is
H03 0270  7    a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who
H03 0280  6    represents not alone his own district but all the people
H03 0290  3    of our country. To honor him is to honor ourselves.
H03 0300  1       In this my first year as a Member of this body I
H03 0300 13    have experienced many memorable moments. Many of these
H03 0310  7    experiences are so important that they will be cherished
H03 0320  6    forever by me. And, like many of you here present,
H03 0330  2    I hold as the highlight of all, the occasion of my
H03 0330 13    first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House.
H03 0340  8    At that time, he afforded me the courtesy of his busy
H03 0350  7    workday for such length as I may need, to speak about
H03 0360  4    my background, my hopes, my views on various national
H03 0370  1    and local topics, and any problems that I may have
H03 0370 11    been vexed with at the time. He was fatherly in his
H03 0380  9    handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise
H03 0390  4    in his counsel. In conclusion, he wished me well- and
H03 0400  4    as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could
H03 0400 13    express himself, he asked to be remembered to my wife
H03 0410 10    and children.
H03 0410 12       In my short period here I believe that at no time
H03 0420 11    has he been otherwise than the most popular man on
H03 0430  7    both sides of the aisle. He is most effective in the
H03 0440  3    ordinary business of the House, and in the legislative
H03 0450  1    accomplishments of this session, he easily rose to
H03 0450  9    great occasion- even at the height of unpleasantness
H03 0460  6    and exciting legislative struggle- and as the Nation
H03 0470  7    witnessed these contests, he rose, even as admitted
H03 0480  1    by those who differed with him, to the proportions
H03 0480 10    of a hero and a noble partisan.
H03 0490  3       I am highly privileged today to commemorate the
H03 0500  1    brilliant career of this parliamentary giant. He will
H03 0500  9    ever be my example as a true statesman; one who is
H03 0510  8    thoroughly human, who affects no dignity, and who is
H03 0520  6    endowed with real ability, genuine worth, and sterling
H03 0530  2    honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests
H03 0530 10    of the country he has loved and served so long. May
H03 0540 10    the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with
H03 0550  6    SAM RAYBURN'S continued service here for years to come.
H03 0560  6    #REMARKS OF HON. WAYNE L. HAYS OF OHIO#
H03 0570  1    _MR. HAYS._
H03 0570  3       It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for
H03 0580  1    me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus
H03 0580 12    of my colleagues in this paean of praise, respect,
H03 0590  7    and affection for Speaker SAM RAYBURN. In this hour
H03 0600  5    of crisis, the wisdom, the dedication, the stabilizing
H03 0610  2    force that he represents in current American government
H03 0620  1    is an almost indispensable source of strength. He has
H03 0620 10    become in this half century the grand old man of American
H03 0630  9    history. It seems to me that the prayers of the whole
H03 0640  7    free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence
H03 0650  3    that SAM RAYBURN'S vigor and his life remain undiminished
H03 0660  2    through the coming decades.
H03 0660  6       Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought
H03 0670  6    for some simple and succinct summation that would define
H03 0680  4    the immense service of this patriot to his country.
H03 0690  1    But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible
H03 0690 12    to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and
H03 0700  9    prodigious contributions SAM RAYBURN has made as an
H03 0710  6    individual, as a legislator, as a statesman and as
H03 0720  3    a leader and conciliator, to the majestic progress
H03 0720 11    of this Nation. It happens that I am a legislator from
H03 0730 10    Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs, the aspirations,
H03 0740  7    the interests of my district and my State. What SAM
H03 0750  6    RAYBURN'S life proves to us all is the magnificent
H03 0760  3    lesson in political science that one can devotedly
H03 0760 11    and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly
H03 0770  7    provincial interests of one's own community, one's
H03 0780  6    own district, one's own State, and by that help himself
H03 0790  6    represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems
H03 0800  3    of this the greatest nation of all time.
H03 0800 11       For SAM RAYBURN never forgot Bonham, his home community,
H03 0810  8    and he never forgot Texas. In the same way I like to
H03 0820 10    think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community,
H03 0830  5    our district, our State. And, if we follow the RAYBURN
H03 0840  4    pattern, as consciously or by an instinctual political
H03 0850  2    sense I like to think I have followed it, then the
H03 0850 13    very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas
H03 0860  9    must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our
H03 0870  6    services to our country. For what SAM RAYBURN'S life
H03 0880  3    in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character
H03 0890  1    are not divisive and there is no such thing as being
H03 0890 12    for your country and neglecting your district. There
H03 0900  7    is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs
H03 0910  5    but indifferent about home needs. The two are as one.
H03 0920  5    This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes
H03 0930  1    close to being the greatest lesson SAM RAYBURN'S career,
H03 0930 10    up to this hour, teaches all of us who would aspire
H03 0940 10    to distinction in political life under our processes
H03 0950  5    of government.
H03 0950  7       More than that, SAM RAYBURN is the very living symbol
H03 0960  8    of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature
H03 0970  6    and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some
H03 0980  2    of his best friends in the opposition. Through the
H03 0980 11    most rancorous battles of political controversy and
H03 0990  6    the most bitterly fought national and presidential
H03 1000  3    campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity
H03 1010  3    and honesty, forthrightness and nobility. SAM RAYBURN
H03 1020  1    has never had to look back at any of his most devastating
H03 1020 13    fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant
H03 1030 10    under fire or his political manners in the heat of
H03 1040  6    conflicting ambitions. This means much to the American
H03 1050  3    tradition. It is an answer in its way, individual and
H03 1060  1    highly dramatic, to the charge that the democratic
H03 1060  9    process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics.
H03 1070  6    And the name RAYBURN is one of the most dominant in
H03 1080  8    the history of American politics for the last half
H03 1090  4    century.
H03 1090  5       It is, I insist, hard to define the RAYBURN contribution
H03 1100  3    to our political civilization because it is so massive
H03 1110  3    and so widespread and so complicated, and because it
H03 1110 12    goes so deep. But this we know: Here is a great life
H03 1120 12    that in every area of American politics gives the American
H03 1130  7    people occasion for pride and that has invested the
H03 1140  6    democratic process with the most decent qualities of
H03 1150  2    honor, decency, and self-respect. I pray to God that
H03 1150 12    he may be spared to us for many years to come for this
H03 1160 12    is an influence the United States and the whole world
H03 1170  6    can ill afford to lose.
H03 1170 11    #REMARKS OF HON. MELVIN PRICE OF ILLINOIS#
H03 1180  7    _MR. PRICE._
H03 1180  9       All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives
H03 1190 10    has been served under the Speakership of SAM RAYBURN.
H03 1200  6    Of this I am proud. I have a distinct admiration for
H03 1210  5    this man we honor today because of the humility with
H03 1220  2    which he carries his greatness.
H03 1220  7       And SAM RAYBURN is a great man- one who will go
H03 1230  9    down in American history as a truly great leader of
H03 1240  4    the Nation. He will be considered not only great among
H03 1250  2    his contemporaries, but as great among all the Americans
H03 1250 11    who have played a part in the country's history since
H03 1260 10    the beginning.
H03 1270  1       I pay my personal tribute to SAM RAYBURN, stalwart
H03 1270 10    Texan and great American, not only because today he
H03 1280  8    establishes a record of having served as Speaker of
H03 1290  6    the House of Representatives more than twice as long
H03 1300  4    as Henry Clay, but because of the contributions he
H03 1300 13    has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation
H03 1310 11    during his almost half century of service as a Member
H03 1320  7    of Congress.
H03 1320  9       Speaker RAYBURN has not limited his leadership as
H03 1330  7    a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker's
H03 1340  7    chair. He had an outstanding record as a legislator
H03 1350  4    since the start of his career in the House in 1913,
H03 1360  1    the 63d Congress. No one has sponsored more progressive
H03 1360 10    and important legislation than has SAM RAYBURN. He
H03 1370  7    is the recognized "father" of the Rural Electrification
H03 1380  5    Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission.
H03 1390  4    But to run the gauntlet of the programs SAM RAYBURN
H03 1400  3    brought into being through his legislative efforts
H03 1410  1    would fill the pages of today's Record.
H03 1410  8       No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service
H03 1420  9    in this House than to be present today to participate
H03 1430  4    in this tribute to this great Speaker, this great legislator,
H03 1440  2    this great Texan, this great American.
H03 1440  8       My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this
H03 1450 10    record he sets here today.
H03 1460  1    #REMARKS OF HON. JOHN S. MONAGAN OF CONNECTICUT#
H03 1470  1    _MR. MONAGAN._
H03 1470  1       SAM RAYBURN is one of the greatest American public
H03 1470 10    figures in the history of our country and I consider
H03 1480 10    that I have been signally honored in the privilege
H03 1490  6    of knowing SAM RAYBURN and sharing with him the rights
H03 1500  5    and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives
H03 1510  2    in the Congress of the United States.
H03 1510  9       Others may speak of Speaker RAYBURN'S uniquely long
H03 1520  8    and devoted service; of his championship of many of
H03 1530  8    the progressive social measures which adorn our statute
H03 1540  5    books today, and of his cooperation in times of adversity
H03 1550  3    with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping
H03 1560  1    to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's
H03 1560 12    stormy international seas.
H03 1570  3       I prefer to speak, however, of SAM RAYBURN, the
H03 1580  2    person, rather than SAM RAYBURN, the American institution.
H03 1590  1       Although SAM RAYBURN affects a gruff exterior in
H03 1600  1    many instances, nevertheless he is fundamentally a
H03 1600  8    man of warm heart and gentle disposition. No one could
H03 1610  7    be more devoted than he to the American Congress as
H03 1620  4    an institution and more aware of its historical significance
H03 1630  2    in the political history of the world, and I shall
H03 1630 12    never forget his moving talks, delivered in simple
H03 1640  8    yet eloquent words, upon the meaning of our jobs as
H03 1650  7    Representatives in the operation of representative
H03 1660  1    government and their importance in the context of today's
H03 1670  1    assault upon popular government.
H03 1670  5       Above all, he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative
H03 1680  5    can go to discuss the personal and professional problems
H03 1690  2    which inevitably confront a new Congressman. In this
H03 1700  2    role of father confessor, he has always been most characteristic
H03 1710  1    and most helpful.
H03 1710  4       On September 16, SAM RAYBURN will have served as
H03 1720  3    Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud
H03 1730  1    to join with others in marking this date, and in expressing
H03 1730 12    my esteem for that notable American, SAM RAYBURN.
