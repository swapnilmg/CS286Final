P15 0010  1    "They make us conformists look good".
P15 0010  7       "That's a peculiar way to think". It wasn't just
P15 0020  7    the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers,
P15 0030  4    of course; she knew that. It was Jim's "little" sister
P15 0040  2    Myra, the unreliable, irresponsible, forever flyaway,
P15 0050  1    Myra. She's a year older than I am, Lucy told herself.
P15 0060  1       "Come, come", Jim said, jollying Lucy a little.
P15 0060  9    "I love you. Susan ready"?
P15 0070  3       Lucy listened. Obviously, Susan was not. Upstairs,
P15 0080  2    busy feet, showering like raindrops, pattered around
P15 0080  9    her room. Susan would be visiting her grandmother for
P15 0090  9    only a few days, but even at seven she was a prudent
P15 0100  8    soul; she always packed for a lifetime, just in case.
P15 0110  4    "Not yet. Every doll in the house must be going with
P15 0120  2    her".
P15 0120  3       "She'd better step on it. It's a long way to Websterville".
P15 0130  3    Jim's fine young face was an expressive one, too; as
P15 0140  3    he looked at her, it registered anxiety. "You know",
P15 0150  1    he said. "Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy.
P15 0150 12    It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a
P15 0160 10    home for them in Paris- but even so, she wants you
P15 0170  7    to know that she's awfully grateful".
P15 0180  1       Lucy did not believe him; Myra appreciated nothing.
P15 0180  9    Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth.
P15 0190  8       "Darling"- she said, and the single word mingled
P15 0200  7    love and exasperation in an equal blend. "She should
P15 0210  3    have told me herself. And will it be only a couple
P15 0220  2    of weeks? Remember what happened the last time"?
P15 0230  1       Leaving Cathy with them, Myra had gone out to the
P15 0230 11    Coast for a supposedly brief visit; but she had stayed
P15 0240  7    all winter, and Cathy had stayed all winter too- with
P15 0250  5    them. Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come
P15 0260  3    home if Gregg, Myra's husband, hadn't gone out to fetch
P15 0270  2    her. "That was an awfully long two weeks".
P15 0270 10    ##
P15 0270 11    FOR an otherwise silent moment, Jim's keys jingled
P15 0280  8    nervously in his pocket. "But she promised- This will
P15 0290  7    be different", he said at last. "You've got to admit
P15 0300  7    she was smart to scare up this fine government job
P15 0310  3    over there- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy
P15 0320  1    in no time. You'll see, Myra's settling down". On the
P15 0320 11    defensive, he added, "I wish you'd think what it must
P15 0330 10    be like for her to be without Greg, to be a new widow,
P15 0340 10    a young widow".
P15 0340 13       "It depends on the widow". Lucy had an idea that
P15 0350 10    Myra loved it. And not for one moment did she believe
P15 0360  8    that Myra had settled down. It seemed to Lucy that
P15 0370  5    all their married life, she and Jim had been doing
P15 0380  1    nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises
P15 0380 10    that were her way of life. Remembering that succession
P15 0390  7    of disasters, she now considered Cathy, an ominous
P15 0400  4    child-cloud on her horizon.
P15 0400  9       It was not that she disliked Cathy. The youngster
P15 0410  8    drew her, troubled her depths; whenever Lucy saw her,
P15 0420  5    she tried, without noise or fuss, to give her the warmth
P15 0430  4    she had never had from Myra. But Cathy was Myra's responsibility,
P15 0440  2    not hers.
P15 0440  4       "I wouldn't even be surprised", she said unhappily,
P15 0450  4    "if Myra tried to leave her with us forever". Myra
P15 0460  2    loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in Paris,
P15 0470  1    of all places- she might forget she had ever been a
P15 0470 12    mother. Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible.
P15 0480  9       "That's a horrible thing to accuse her of"! Jim
P15 0490  7    was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what
P15 0500  4    he said, he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy.
P15 0510  1    He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up, fiercely,
P15 0520  1    "Susan! Susan! Get moving"!
P15 0520  5       A startled piping sound returned.
P15 0530  3       "Don't yell at us", Lucy said. Was it only a few
P15 0540  5    nights ago that they had been standing together in
P15 0540 14    front of the house looking at the moon-washed river?
P15 0550 10    Their arms around each other, they had been talking
P15 0560  7    of the present and the future; their talk and their
P15 0570  5    feeling had been as deep and warm, as steeped in light,
P15 0580  2    as the air around them. Then, from within the still,
P15 0580 12    sleeping house, the telephone had rung; Myra, with
P15 0590  8    her news, was on the other end of the line.
P15 0600  5       Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at
P15 0610  2    her. His dark brows, which had been lowered in anger,
P15 0610 12    smoothed. "Please", he said. "There isn't a chance
P15 0620  8    of Myra's letting anything like that happen. Let's
P15 0630  6    stay friends".
P15 0630  8       But they weren't just friends, Lucy thought; they
P15 0640  7    were husband and wife, and Myra had no right muddling
P15 0650  7    and chilling their marriage. The only thing that had
P15 0660  4    ever come between them was that worthless, selfish
P15 0660 12    sister of his. Lucy was sick of it.
P15 0670  8       "Well, at last", she said, because Susan was clattering
P15 0680  5    down the stairs.
P15 0680  8    ##
P15 0680  9    SUSAN looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms
P15 0690  9    were straining with a burden of dolls. "I'm ready",
P15 0700  7    she announced.
P15 0700  9       "Do you need that big bundle"? Jim said. His voice
P15 0710  9    had sharp edges, as though he knew very well Lucy and
P15 0720  8    he were not friends at the moment. "All that junk"?
P15 0730  4       Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed
P15 0740  3    an instant grief; to her, each of her dolls was a real
P15 0750  1    person with a living heart.
P15 0750  6       "Now, now", Lucy said, approaching Susan with a
P15 0760  4    handkerchief, mopping skillfully. "Your father didn't
P15 0770  2    mean it, Susan". She gave Jim a quick, shape-up look
P15 0770 13    of warning. "He'll take every one of them".
P15 0780  8       Jim groaned, but he lifted Susan's suitcase and
P15 0790  7    said, in a gentler tone, "Sure- the entire thousand.
P15 0800  6    And when you get back from Grandma's, Cathy will be
P15 0810  3    here to play with you. Nice"?
P15 0810  9       "No", Susan said, grappling with her outsized armload
P15 0820  7    of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect.
P15 0830  2       And at this point, Lucy thought, there should be
P15 0840  1    a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she
P15 0840 10    could sympathize with Susan; there ought to be a limit
P15 0850  9    to sharing, too.
P15 0860  1       That was one more reason she didn't look forward
P15 0860 10    to Cathy's visit, short or long; the last one had been
P15 0870  9    a Lilliputian war. She suspected that Cathy had been
P15 0880  5    competing with Susan for attention that she had never
P15 0890  3    had.
P15 0890  4       "Well", Jim said, out of the silence, "let's get
P15 0900  2    going, dolls and all".
P15 0900  6       When the car, with Susan's hands waving wildly from
P15 0910  5    the rear window, disappeared down the driveway, Lucy
P15 0920  3    stood looking after its pale dust. The day was brilliant
P15 0930  1    around her- flower-scented, crisp with breeze- yet
P15 0930  9    her inner turmoil darkened it. She had let Jim go with
P15 0940  9    a chilly good-by, a chillier kiss. She was sorry, and
P15 0950  6    angry at herself, because never in their life together
P15 0960  3    had she done that. She turned and began to walk toward
P15 0970  1    the house.
P15 0970  3       At the feeding station, the raffish group of cowbirds
P15 0980  1    again bobbed and gobbled over the ground, but now,
P15 0980 10    gorgeous among them, was a beautiful red cardinal,
P15 0990  7    radiant in its feathered vestments. The handsome bird
P15 1000  4    was solitary; its mate must be at home, silently guarding
P15 1010  2    their nest. She had better stay there, Lucy thought;
P15 1010 11    the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests
P15 1020  9    without sentinels.
P15 1030  1       Well, Lucy? she said to herself, abandoning the
P15 1030  9    cardinals and the cowbirds. She had a day of things
P15 1040 10    to do; among them, she had to prepare the guest room.
P15 1050  7    How long would it be occupied? she wondered, with a
P15 1060  4    baffled feeling of helplessness. As long as the unscrupulous
P15 1070  1    Myra chose? For a moment, her mind returned again to
P15 1070 11    the strange, flying world of birds, and she said to
P15 1080 10    herself. It isn't only birds that dump their children
P15 1090  7    in other people's nests ...
P15 1100  1       In the sunshine of late afternoon, Lucy stood looking
P15 1100 10    at the ready guest room. There were new yellow curtains,
P15 1110  8    bright as a child's life ought to be, a new bedspread,
P15 1120  8    lively with hopping rabbits, and hanging from the ceiling
P15 1130  4    was an airy Mother Goose Mobile, spinning slowly in
P15 1140  2    the breeze. A row of little hangers waited for a child's
P15 1140 13    clothes in the neatly empty closet; since Myra had
P15 1150  9    always put most of Greg's money on her own back, Lucy
P15 1160  8    suspected that no more than a few of that long row
P15 1170  6    would be needed. The closet was faintly fragrant with
P15 1180  2    lavender, and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory
P15 1180 12    slipped into her mind, like a lavender ghost: Greg's
P15 1190  8    house, on the day he was buried, and the child, pale,
P15 1200  7    silent, baffled, watching the funeral guests with panicky
P15 1210  4    eyes. Many times since his death that memory had worried
P15 1220  2    and troubled her.
P15 1220  5       Out in the hall, the upstairs phone shrilled, and
P15 1230  3    the small ghost vanished. When she picked up the receiver,
P15 1240  1    her mother's cheerful voice was there.
P15 1240  7       "Websterville Junction calling", she said. "I just
P15 1250  7    thought I'd let you know. Myra dropped Cathy this morning,
P15 1260  6    and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours
P15 1270  5    ago. I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy".
P15 1280  2       "I can imagine"! Susan was an active character;
P15 1290  1    for Mother to be able to call, Susan must be napping
P15 1290 12    now, surrounded by her multitude of dolls. Lucy drew
P15 1300  8    out the chair and sat down; she relaxed a little, and
P15 1310  6    some of the tension went out of her. You could think
P15 1320  3    yourself as grown up as Methuselah, yet the maternal
P15 1320 12    voice still kept its comforting magic. "How was Cathy"?
P15 1340  1       "Subdued. But Myra was the merriest widow I ever
P15 1340  9    saw".
P15 1340 10       On her way to the airport, on her way to Paris-
P15 1350 11    you bet, Lucy said to herself. "I've been fixing up
P15 1360  7    the guest room for Cathy".
P15 1370  1       There was a momentary pause, and then her mother
P15 1370 10    said, "How long is she supposed to stay"?
P15 1380  6       "Just for a couple of weeks, till Myra finds a place
P15 1390  6    for them".
P15 1390  8       "Well"- This time there was a long silence, while
P15 1400  7    the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life.
P15 1410  4       Puzzled, Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper;
P15 1420  1    her mother was forthright; she was not usually given
P15 1420 10    to mysterious silences. Was she thinking along the
P15 1430  7    same lines Lucy was- that it was quite possible Cathy
P15 1440  6    might be left with her for good? "You mean once Myra
P15 1450  4    gets to Paris"? Once the soft, pretty moth found the
P15 1460  3    bright light she had always wanted?
P15 1460  9       Suddenly, seekingly, Lucy asked, "Mother, do you
P15 1470  6    know something I don't know"?
P15 1480  1       Again there was that curious pause, and then her
P15 1480 10    mother said, "I guess I do. Just before Myra left-
P15 1490 10    She was saying good-by to Cathy, and she didn't realize
P15 1500  7    I was near". She hesitated, as though hunting over
P15 1510  5    words and ways of putting them. "Cathy was in tears,
P15 1520  3    of course, and I heard Myra say, 'Now be good, and
P15 1520 14    at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present
P15 1530  8    from Paris'".
P15 1540  1       Shocked speechless, Lucy sat there. Then she jumped
P15 1540  9    to her feet, the elastic phone cord uncoiling like
P15 1550  8    a black snake. "Christmastime!" Then it was no bogey
P15 1560  6    she had dreamed up; it was only too true. Myra had
P15 1570  6    no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks.
P15 1580  3       For a moment, anger darkened the hallway about her,
P15 1590  1    and when she found her voice, anger thickened it. "That
P15 1590 11    does it"! she said. "I'll keep Cathy for two weeks.
P15 1600  9    Then, if Myra does nothing about fetching her, I'll
P15 1610  7    pack her right back to her mother- if I have to take
P15 1620  8    her myself"! Her hand tightened on the receiver. "And
P15 1630  3    that's what I'm going to tell Jim". For Lucy, the day's
P15 1640  4    nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.
P15 1650  1       As she hung up, she saw through the hall's open
P15 1650 11    window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings,
P15 1660  6    and heard their grotesque singing. Cowbird Myra! She's
P15 1670  4    not going to get away with it.
P15 1670 11    ##
P15 1680  1    CATHY is tired, Lucy thought, watching them come slowly
P15 1680 10    up the path. The child's thin legs were plodding. She
P15 1690  9    trudged along slowly, both hands clutching a tired
P15 1700  6    teddy bear. She was at the moment just a small, walking
P15 1710  4    package, being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's
P15 1720  1    house. Unlike Susan, she was traveling light; the worn
P15 1720 10    teddy bear, a tiny suitcase that Jim carried, and the
P15 1730 10    clothes she wore, were all she had. Lucy glancing at
P15 1740  7    the miniature case, knew there would not be enough
P15 1750  4    in it for the shortest of stays; they would have to
P15 1760  2    buy things for her. She opened the door.
