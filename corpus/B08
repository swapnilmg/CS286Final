B08 0010  1       Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery.
B08 0010 10    She had, she said, heard that the plant was closing.
B08 0020  9    It couldn't close, she said. She had raised a calf,
B08 0030  7    grown it beef-fat. She had, with her own work-weary
B08 0040  3    hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout,
B08 0040 12    bud, blossom, and get ready to bear. She was ready
B08 0050 10    to kill the beef, dress it out, and with vegetables
B08 0060  6    from her garden was going to can soup, broth, hash,
B08 0070  2    and stew against the winter. She had done it last year,
B08 0070 13    and the year before, and the year before that, and
B08 0080 10    she, and her people were dependent upon these cans
B08 0090  6    for food.
B08 0090  8       This did not happen in counties of North Georgia,
B08 0100  5    where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land.
B08 0110  3    Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly
B08 0120  1    and gives early life to the things growing in the flat
B08 0120 12    fields.
B08 0130  1       This happened in Decatur, DeKalb County, not 10
B08 0130  9    miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta.
B08 0140  5       And now, the woman, tired and trembling, came here
B08 0150  4    to the DeKalb County cannery. "Is it so the cannery
B08 0160  2    is going to close"?
B08 0160  6       O. N. Moss, 61, tall, grey as a possum, canning
B08 0170  6    plant chief since 1946, didn't know what to say. He
B08 0180  4    did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans
B08 0180 15    this summer. He did say he was out of cans, the No.
B08 0190 12    3's, but "I requisitioned 22,000". He said he had No.
B08 0200  7    2's enough to last two weeks more.
B08 0210  3       Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one. A
B08 0220  1    three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman
B08 0220  9    Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery
B08 0230  8    be closed. Reason: the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.
B08 0240  6       But DeKalb citizens, those who use the facilities
B08 0250  5    of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed to
B08 0260  2    make any money.
B08 0260  5       "The cannery", said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen, an active
B08 0270  4    booster of the cannery since its opening during the
B08 0280  2    war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the "victory
B08 0280 12    garden" produce, "is a service to the taxpayer. And
B08 0290  9    one of the best services available to the people who
B08 0300  6    try to raise and can meat, to plant, grow vegetables
B08 0310  3    and put them up. It helps those people who help themselves.
B08 0320  1       "The county, though, seems more interested in those
B08 0330  1    people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare
B08 0330 12    checks and line up for surplus food".
B08 0340  6       A driver of a dairy truck, who begins work at 1
B08 0350  5    a.m. finishes before breakfast, then goes out and grows
B08 0360  2    a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and
B08 0360 13    feed a family of five, asked, "What in the world will
B08 0370  9    we do"?
B08 0370 11       "What in the world", echoed others, those come with
B08 0380  9    the beans, potatoes, the tomatoes, "will any of us
B08 0390  7    do"?
B08 0390  8       Moss, a man who knows how much the cannery helps
B08 0400  6    the county, doesn't believe it will close. But he is
B08 0410  4    in the middle, an employe of DeKalb, but on the side
B08 0420  1    of the people.
B08 0420  4       The young married people; the old couples. The dairy
B08 0430  2    truck driver; the old woman with the stew.
B08 0430 10       "Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps", he
B08 0440 10    said. "Sir, I know the cannery helps".
B08 0460  1       Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness
B08 0460 11    comes hard. When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately
B08 0470  8    caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to
B08 0480  8    say, "Just forget it". There is one thing I know; a
B08 0490  7    person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace
B08 0500  2    as long as the heart holds a grudge. I know a man who
B08 0500 15    held resentment against a neighbor for more than three
B08 0510  9    decades. Several years ago I was his pastor. One night,
B08 0520  8    at the close of the evening service, he came forward,
B08 0530  4    left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart
B08 0540  2    to God. After almost everyone had gone he told me the
B08 0540 13    simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved
B08 0550  9    a fence a few feet over on his land.
B08 0560  3       "We tried to settle this dispute", he said, "but
B08 0570  1    could never come to an agreement. I settled it tonight",
B08 0570 11    he continued. "I leave this church with a feeling that
B08 0580  9    a great weight has been lifted off my heart, I have
B08 0590  8    left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor".
B08 0600  3       Forgiveness is the door through which a person must
B08 0610  3    pass to enter the Kingdom of God. You cannot wear the
B08 0610 14    banner of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy
B08 0620 11    and grudges in your heart. Henry van Dyke said, "Forgive
B08 0630  8    and forget if you can; but forgive anyway".
B08 0640  4       Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness.
B08 0650  2    We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others
B08 0650 12    before we can secure God's forgiveness. "For if ye
B08 0660  9    forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
B08 0670  5    will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their
B08 0680  5    trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses".
B08 0690  3    Matthew 6:14-15. It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness
B08 0700  3    until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.
B08 0710  1       Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is
B08 0710  8    unlimited. In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples
B08 0720  8    to pray we find these words, "Forgive us our debts".
B08 0730  6    When a person meets God's requirements for the experience
B08 0740  4    of forgiveness he is forgiven. God's mercy and patience
B08 0750  3    will last forever. Forgiveness implies more than a
B08 0750 11    person wanting his past sins covered by God's love.
B08 0760  9    It also implies that a man wants his future to be free
B08 0770 10    from the mistakes of the past. We want the past forgiven,
B08 0780  6    but at the same time we must be willing for God to
B08 0790  3    direct the future.
B08 0790  6       Finally, we must be willing to forgive others as
B08 0800  3    many times as they sin against us. Once Peter asked,
B08 0810  1    "How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive
B08 0810 12    him? Till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, until
B08 0820  8    seventy times seven". Matthew 18:21-22.
B08 0830  4       Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He gave us an
B08 0840  4    example of it on the cross. With all the energy of
B08 0840 15    his broken body he prayed, "Father, forgive them, for
B08 0850  8    they know not what they do". Luke 23:34.
B08 0870  1       She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years
B08 0870 13    now, although she's still a teen-ager who looks like
B08 0880  9    a baby, she is getting married. Her mother, now dead,
B08 0890  6    was my good friend and when she came to tell us about
B08 0900  4    her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering
B08 0900 16    wish to say something meaningful to her, something
B08 0910  8    her mother would wish said. For a while there was such
B08 0920  8    shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself
B08 0930  4    heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia.
B08 0940  3    But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had
B08 0940 14    been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable
B08 0950 10    to the young female- six girls sprawled on one bed,
B08 0960  7    drinking Cokes and giggling- she came back to the kitchen
B08 0970  9    to talk with me a minute.
B08 0980  1       "How do you know you love somebody enough to get
B08 0980 10    married"? she asked.
B08 0990  1       It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers
B08 0990 10    have ever asked: How can you be sure?
B08 1000  8       "Aren't you sure"? I asked, looking at her searchingly.
B08 1010  7    I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait,
B08 1020  7    to consider, to know for certain because life is so
B08 1030  3    long and marriage is so important. But if she were
B08 1030 13    just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such
B08 1040  9    a question might frighten her out of a really good
B08 1050  7    marriage. Besides, in all honesty, I don't know how
B08 1060  3    you can be sure. I don't know any secret recipe for
B08 1060 14    certainty. In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless
B08 1070  6    state of being in love the usual signposts that guide
B08 1080  6    you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes
B08 1090  3    obscured. I knew of but one test and I threw it out
B08 1100  2    to her for what it was worth.
B08 1100  9       "Does he ever bore you"? I asked.
B08 1110  3       "Bore me"? she was shocked. Oh, no-o! Why, he's
B08 1120  2    so darling and ..."
B08 1120  6       "I mean", I went on ruthlessly, "when he's not talking
B08 1130  5    about you or himself or the wonders of love, is he
B08 1140  5    interesting? Does he care about things that matter
B08 1150  1    to you? Can you visualize being stranded with him on
B08 1150 11    a desert island for years and years and still find
B08 1160  8    him fascinating?
B08 1160 10       Because, honey, I thought silently, there are plenty
B08 1170  8    of desert islands in every marriage- long periods when
B08 1180  6    you're hopelessly stranded, together. And if you bore
B08 1190  5    each other then, heaven help you.
B08 1190 11       She came back the other day to reassure me. She
B08 1200  9    has studied and observed and she is convinced that
B08 1210  5    her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.
B08 1220  1       She asked if I had other advice and, heady with
B08 1220 11    success, I rushed it in, I hope not too late. Be friends
B08 1230 12    with your mother-in-law. Jokes, cartoons and cynics
B08 1240  5    to the contrary, mothers-in-law make good friends.
B08 1260  1       I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well. But I was deeply
B08 1260 13    moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St.
B08 1270 10    Luke's Church in Atlanta. It was the cry of not just
B08 1280 10    one heart; it spoke for many in the clergy, I suspect.
B08 1290  6    The pulpit is a lonely place. Who stops to think of
B08 1300  4    that?
B08 1300  5       Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind
B08 1310  3    the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of
B08 1310 13    service to this majestic church. "Such a church needs
B08 1320  9    vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only
B08 1330  9    so much of these endowments", he told his members.
B08 1340  5       A minister should not stay "beyond the time that
B08 1350  3    his leadership should benefit" his church, he wrote,
B08 1350 11    "... for he becomes ordinary ...". @
B08 1360  7    ##
B08 1360  8    And so the young minister resigned, to go and study
B08 1370  6    and pray, having never passed a day, he told his parishioners,
B08 1380  4    when "I did not gain from you far more than I ever
B08 1390  3    gave to you".
B08 1390  6       His very honest act called up the recent talk I
B08 1400  3    had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who
B08 1400 11    said: "I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give
B08 1410 12    a message of love and comfort to other men, and I would
B08 1420  9    have it no other way: and it is unworthy to think of
B08 1430  7    self. But oh, how I do sometimes need just a moment
B08 1440  3    of rest, and peace, in myself".
B08 1440  9       A man who gives himself to God and to the believers
B08 1450  8    of his church takes upon himself a life of giving.
B08 1460  5    He does not expect to get great riches or he would
B08 1470  1    not have chosen to answer the call to preach. The good
B08 1470 12    ones are not motivated to seek vainly, nor are they
B08 1480  8    disposed to covet comfort, or they would have been
B08 1490  4    led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity. Theirs
B08 1500  2    is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.
B08 1500  9    ##
B08 1500 10    Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from
B08 1510 10    him and expect interpretation of the infinite through
B08 1520  5    him- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due,
B08 1530  4    we of the congregations are the first to tell him what
B08 1530 15    is in our minds instead of listening to what is in
B08 1540 11    his soul. We press him to conform to our comfortable
B08 1550  7    conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with
B08 1560  2    his word, and God's. We do not defeat the good ones
B08 1570  1    with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while
B08 1570 11    expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return
B08 1580  8    for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks
B08 1590  5    a week, American cash. If we break the minister to
B08 1600  2    our bit, we are buying back our own sins. If he won't
B08 1600 14    break, we add to the stress he bears.
B08 1610  7       And a minister of all men is most conscious that
B08 1620  3    he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly
B08 1630  1    humanity is heir to. We expect him to be noble, and
B08 1630 12    to make us so- yet he knows, and tries to tell us,
B08 1640  9    how very humble man must be.
B08 1650  1       We expect bestowal of God's love through him. But
B08 1650 10    how little love we give him. The church truly is not
B08 1660  9    a rest home for saints, but a hospital for sinners.
B08 1670  4    Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room
B08 1680  2    to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the
B08 1680 12    man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers,
B08 1690 10    too.
