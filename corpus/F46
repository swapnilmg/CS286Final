F46 0010  1    They would not be pleased to have it published back
F46 0010 11    home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong
F46 0020  8    at the Treasury's expense. They would be particularly
F46 0030  5    displeased with the State Department if it were the
F46 0040  4    source of such reports. Few things are more perilous
F46 0040 13    for the State Department than a displeased congressman.
F46 0050  8       The reason for this bears explaining for those who
F46 0060  8    may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic
F46 0070  6    energy on Congress when the Russians are so available.
F46 0080  3    First, the State Department is unique among government
F46 0090  1    agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers
F46 0090 10    may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture
F46 0100  7    Department's budget. Businessmen will rise if Congress
F46 0110  5    attacks the Commerce Department. Labor restrains undue
F46 0120  4    brutality toward the Labor Department; the Chamber
F46 0130  2    of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope
F46 0130 10    of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman
F46 0140  9    who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health, Education,
F46 0150  7    and Welfare. The congressman's patriotism is always
F46 0160  4    involved when he turns upon the Defense Department.
F46 0170  2    Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every
F46 0180  1    voter who can write.
F46 0180  5       With all these agencies, the congressman must constantly
F46 0190  3    check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.
F46 0200  1    No such political restraint subdues his blood when
F46 0200  9    he gazes upon the State Department in anger.
F46 0210  6       In many sections he may even reap applause from
F46 0220  4    press and public for giving it a good lesson. After
F46 0230  1    all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer,
F46 0230 12    the laborer, or the businessman, but to foreigners.
F46 0240  7    Not only do these foreigners not vote for American
F46 0250  5    congressmen; they are also probably ungrateful for
F46 0260  3    Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department
F46 0270  1    men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and
F46 0270  9    do-gooders who have never met a payroll? Will not the
F46 0280 10    righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he
F46 0290  8    reminds them to get right with America and if he saves
F46 0300  5    the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their
F46 0300 15    schemes? The chances are excellent that he will.
F46 0310  8       The result is that the State Department's perpetual
F46 0320  6    position before Congress is the resigned pose of the
F46 0330  6    whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the
F46 0340  2    master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People
F46 0340 12    in this position do not offend the master by relating
F46 0350  9    his peccadilloes to the newspapers. State keeps the
F46 0360  5    junketeering list a secret.
F46 0360  9       The Department expects and receives no thanks from
F46 0370  8    Congress for its discretion. Congress is a harsh master.
F46 0380  6    State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign
F46 0390  4    itinerary; its embassies are expected to supply him
F46 0400  4    with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers
F46 0410  1    are expected to entertain him according to his whim,
F46 0410 10    frequently with their savings for the children's college
F46 0420  7    tuition.
F46 0420  8       But come the next session of Congress, State can
F46 0430  8    expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand
F46 0440  6    when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic
F46 0450  3    entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses
F46 0450 10    for its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may
F46 0460  9    have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to
F46 0470  7    paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream
F46 0480  3    that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for
F46 0490  2    a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the
F46 0490 11    Treasury.
F46 0500  1       In the matter of money State's most unrelenting
F46 0500  9    watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative
F46 0510  6    John J. Rooney, of Brooklyn, who controlled the purse
F46 0520  6    for diplomatic administrative expenses. Diplomats stayed
F46 0530  3    up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence,
F46 0540  2    not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing
F46 0550  1    worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors
F46 0550  8    told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around-
F46 0560  9    friendly persuasion, groveling abasement, pressure
F46 0570  4    subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen,
F46 0580  2    tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic
F46 0590  1    corps. Rooney remained untouched.
F46 0590  5       "The trouble" explained Loy Henderson, then Deputy
F46 0600  5    Undersecretary for Administration, "is that when we
F46 0610  5    get into an argument with him about this thing, it
F46 0620  2    always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget
F46 0620 12    than we do".
F46 0630  2       One year the Department collected a file of case
F46 0630 11    histories to document its argument that men in the
F46 0640  9    field were paying the government's entertainment bills
F46 0650  3    out of personal income. News of the project reached
F46 0660  3    the press. Next day, reports went through the Department
F46 0670  1    that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered
F46 0670 10    a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for
F46 0680  8    increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an
F46 0690  5    oath that, that year, expense allowances would not
F46 0700  1    rise a dollar. They didn't.
F46 0700  6       The Department's constant fight with the House for
F46 0710  6    money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic
F46 0720  1    bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional
F46 0730  1    power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the
F46 0730  9    Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to
F46 0740  9    use it on the State Department's back, or on the head
F46 0750  6    of the Secretary of State.
F46 0750 11       With its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze
F46 0760  9    the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual
F46 0770  8    testimony before committees, as it did with Dean Acheson.
F46 0780  5    John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal
F46 0790  2    show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was
F46 0790 12    then operating the Senate, refused to let it become
F46 0800  9    an Inquisition. During Dulles's first two years in
F46 0810  6    office, while Republicans ran the Senate, the Department
F46 0820  4    was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood
F46 0830  2    since 1945.
F46 0830  4       An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod,
F46 0840  2    a former F.B.I. man installed as security officer upon
F46 0850  2    congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance.
F46 0850  9    So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower
F46 0860  9    appointed him Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler,
F46 0870  7    however, was Senator Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson
F46 0880  5    had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department,
F46 0890  4    Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. Fretting
F46 0900  2    privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized
F46 0900 10    bureaucrats, Dulles remained serene and detached while
F46 0910  7    the hatchet men had their way.
F46 0920  4       In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that
F46 0930  2    anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that
F46 0930 12    heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything
F46 0940  7    but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy.
F46 0950  6    In any event, the example of Acheson's trampling by
F46 0960  3    the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it.
F46 0970  2    He elected to "get along".
F46 0970  7       During this dark chapter in State Department history,
F46 0980  5    men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven
F46 0990  3    wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol
F46 1000  1    Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in
F46 1000 10    the curious logic of the time, with present treasonous
F46 1010  8    intent. Their successors, absorbing the lesson, made
F46 1020  5    it a point to have few ideas.
F46 1020 12       This, in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial
F46 1030  9    criticism as the Democrats took control. In the new
F46 1040  6    style, the Department was berated as intellectually
F46 1050  1    barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed
F46 1050 10    to outwit the Russians. For three or four years in
F46 1060  9    the mid-1950's, this complaint was heard rumbling up
F46 1070  6    from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative
F46 1080  5    afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault was
F46 1090  2    with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking
F46 1090 10    done by anyone but himself.
F46 1100  4       An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of
F46 1110  2    new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant
F46 1110 11    for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to
F46 1120  7    the next generation.
F46 1120 10    #@ GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS#
F46 1130  5    THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations
F46 1140  4    in Washington. They range from the Soviet Embassy on
F46 1150  3    Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting
F46 1150 10    a funeral-accessories display house, to what Congressman
F46 1160  6    Rooney has called "that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth
F46 1170  6    Street", the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the
F46 1180  4    Belgians.
F46 1180  5       Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and
F46 1190  4    the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers and
F46 1200  2    the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party
F46 1200 12    crasher, and the patriot, of the rented tails, the
F46 1210  9    double cross, and the tired Lothario.
F46 1220  2       Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries
F46 1230  1    around the earth and an endless stream of home-office
F46 1230 11    instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite
F46 1240 10    variety of contingencies. Here are hatched plans for
F46 1250  6    getting a share of the American bounty, the secret
F46 1260  3    of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.
F46 1270  1    Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words
F46 1270 12    purporting to inform home ministries about what is
F46 1280  8    really happening inside Washington. Some, like the
F46 1290  4    British and the French, maintain an elaborate system
F46 1300  2    of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying
F46 1300 10    special areas of the American scene. Other embassies
F46 1310  8    cable home The New York Times without changing a comma.
F46 1320  8       Each has its peculiar style. The Soviet Embassy
F46 1330  5    is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters.
F46 1340  2    When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957
F46 1350  3    from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to
F46 1350 12    change this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a TV
F46 1360  9    announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's
F46 1370  8    astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine
F46 1380  9    Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor
F46 1390  4    Pavlovitch Karamazov.
F46 1390  6       Where his predecessors had glowered, Menshikov smiled.
F46 1400  5    Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers'
F46 1410  6    assistants, Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white
F46 1420  4    tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available
F46 1430  1    man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador
F46 1430  9    became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians
F46 1440  8    and National Press Club alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's
F46 1450  6    phrase, it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard
F46 1460  6    of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore
F46 1470  2    that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"?
F46 1480  1    And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike".
F46 1490  1       "Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave
F46 1490  7    him. His English was usable and he used it fearlessly.
F46 1500  8    Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy, he
F46 1510  6    hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried:
F46 1520  3    "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that coincided
F46 1530  2    with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation
F46 1540  1    of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten
F46 1540  9    Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out
F46 1550  7    of its wits. Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind
F46 1560  5    everyone that Judas, too, had been able to smile.
F46 1570  2       The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the
F46 1570 10    Russians usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence
F46 1580  6    temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics,
F46 1590  5    Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin' Mike" dropped
F46 1600  3    quietly out of the press except for an occasional story
F46 1610  2    reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the
F46 1610 11    Middle West.
F46 1620  1       The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and
F46 1620  9    the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians.
F46 1630  9    When King Saud visited Washington, the overwhelming
F46 1640  5    question consuming the press was the size of his family.
F46 1650  7    Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds.
F46 1660  4    The State Department was little help on this, or on
F46 1670  2    much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted
F46 1670 11    a Middle East Information officer for routine vital
F46 1680  7    statistics got nowhere until the State Department man
F46 1690  5    produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published
F46 1700  3    by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This is where
F46 1710  3    I get my information from", he confided. "But bring
F46 1710 12    it right back. It's the only copy I've got".
F46 1720  9       The size of Saud's family was still being debated
F46 1730  7    when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower.
F46 1740  5    When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed
F46 1750  3    into Hagerty's office to report on the interview. The
F46 1760  2    massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides
F46 1760  9    about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central
F46 1770  8    question. How many children did the King have?
F46 1780  6       "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.
F46 1790  1       And how many of these were sons?
F46 1790  8       "Twenty-five", the sheik replied.
F46 1800  4       "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter asked, "that
F46 1810  3    the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom
F46 1820  1    are sons"?
F46 1820  3       The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is precisely
F46 1830  2    correct".
F46 1830  3       The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language.
F46 1840  3    When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East
F46 1850  1    peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon
F46 1850 10    found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo,
F46 1860  7    a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's. The reports
F46 1870  6    of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was
F46 1880  4    relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly
F46 1890  2    incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the
F46 1890  8    Israeli Foreign Minister, Mrs. Golda Meir. Finally
F46 1900  7    he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete
F46 1910  8    commitment in return for Israeli concessions.
