P26 0010  1    I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning
P26 0010 12    when I was plowing the stubble field far across the
P26 0020  7    hill from the farm buildings. It had grown hot early
P26 0030  5    that day, and I hoped that the boy, my brother's son,
P26 0040  2    would soon come across the broad black area of plowed
P26 0040 12    ground, carrying the jar of cool water. The boy usually
P26 0050 10    was sent out at about that time with the water, and
P26 0060  7    he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick
P26 0070  4    along, to play with. He pretended that the lath was
P26 0070 14    a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and
P26 0080 10    make buzzing, tractor sounds with his lips.
P26 0090  5       I almost ran over the snake before I could stop
P26 0100  2    the tractor in time. I had turned at the corner of
P26 0100 13    the field and I had to look back to raise the plow
P26 0110 11    and then to drop it again into the earth, and I was
P26 0120  6    thinking of the boy and the water anyway, and when
P26 0130  2    I looked again down the furrow, the snake was there.
P26 0130 12    It lay half in the furrow and half out, and the front
P26 0140 10    wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the
P26 0150  9    clutch. The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight
P26 0160  3    of the plow turning the earth, and the tractor stopped
P26 0170  1    instantly.
P26 0170  2       The snake slid slowly and with great care from the
P26 0180  1    new ridge the plow had made, into the furrow and did
P26 0180 12    not go any further. I had never liked snakes much,
P26 0190  7    I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as
P26 0200  5    a child whenever I saw one, but this snake was clean
P26 0210  2    and bright and very beautiful. He was multi-colored
P26 0210 11    and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his
P26 0220 10    arched and tapered head only so slightly. Go out of
P26 0230  6    the furrow, snake, I said, but it did not move at all.
P26 0240  3    I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out, hoping
P26 0240 14    to frighten him with the noise, but the snake only
P26 0250 10    flicked its black, forked tongue and faced the huge
P26 0260  6    tractor wheel, without fright or concern.
P26 0270  1       I let the engine idle then, and I got down and went
P26 0270 13    around the wheel and stood beside it. My movement did
P26 0280 10    frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed
P26 0290  7    delicately a couple of feet and stopped again, and
P26 0300  3    its tongue was working very rapidly. I followed it,
P26 0300 12    looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back,
P26 0310  9    the colors clear and sharp and perfect, in orange and
P26 0320  7    green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist
P26 0330  4    down its back, and the diamonds were set one within
P26 0330 14    the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black.
P26 0340  8    The colors were astonishing, clear and bright, and
P26 0350  5    it was as if the body held a fire of its own, and the
P26 0360  5    colors came through that transparent flesh and skin,
P26 0370  1    vivid and alive and warm. The eyes were clear and black
P26 0370 12    and the slender body was arched slightly. His flat
P26 0380  7    and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him
P26 0390  6    and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn
P26 0400  2    mouth.
P26 0400  3       You beauty, I said, I couldn't kill you. You are
P26 0410  2    much too beautiful. I had killed snakes before, when
P26 0410 11    I was younger, but there had been no animal like this
P26 0420  9    one, and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such
P26 0430  6    as that should die. I picked him up, and the length
P26 0440  4    of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only
P26 0440 13    a little wildly, and I could feel the coolness of that
P26 0450 11    radiant, fire-colored body, like splendid ice, and
P26 0460  6    I knew that he had eaten only recently because there
P26 0470  3    were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart
P26 0480  1    of him, like fieldmice swallowed whole might make.
P26 0480  9       The body caressed through my hands like cool satin,
P26 0490  8    and my hands, usually tanned and dark, were pale beside
P26 0500  6    it, and I asked it where the fire colors could come
P26 0510  3    from the coolness of that body. I lowered him so he
P26 0510 14    would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool,
P26 0520 11    newly-plowed earth, from between my pale hands. The
P26 0530  6    snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with
P26 0540  3    a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty, and he carried
P26 0550  1    his head a little above the rolled clods. The sharp,
P26 0550 11    burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain
P26 0560  7    against the black soil, like a target.
P26 0570  1       I felt good and satisfied, looking at the snake.
P26 0570 10    It shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned
P26 0580 10    stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against
P26 0590  8    the paleness of myself. The color and beauty of it
P26 0600  6    were strange and wonderful and somehow alien, too,
P26 0610  1    in that dry and dusty and uncolored field.
P26 0610  9       I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the
P26 0620  8    plow closely because the field was drawn across the
P26 0630  4    long hillside and even in that good soil there was
P26 0630 14    a danger of rocks. I had my back to the corner of the
P26 0640 13    triangular field that pointed towards the house. The
P26 0650  7    earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and
P26 0660  6    clean the plowshares because they were not scouring
P26 0670  1    properly, and I did not look back towards the place
P26 0670 11    until I had turned the corner and was plowing across
P26 0680  7    the upper line of the large field, a long way from
P26 0690  5    where I had stopped because of the snake.
P26 0700  1       I saw it all at a glance. The boy was there at the
P26 0700 13    lower corner of the field, and he was in the plowed
P26 0710  9    earth, stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied
P26 0720  5    impatience. Even at that distance, with no sound but
P26 0730  1    the sound of the tractor, I could tell the fierce mark
P26 0730 12    of brutality on the boy. I could see the hunched-up
P26 0740 10    shoulders, the savage determination, the dance of his
P26 0750  5    feet as he ground the snake with his heels, and the
P26 0760  3    pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the
P26 0760 14    stick.
P26 0770  1       Stop it, I shouted, but the lumbering and mighty
P26 0770 10    tractor roared on, above anything I could say. I stopped
P26 0780  8    the tractor and I shouted down to the boy, and I knew
P26 0790  8    he could hear me, for the morning was clear and still,
P26 0800  3    but he did not even hesitate in that brutal, murdering
P26 0810  1    dance. It was no use. I felt myself tremble, thinking
P26 0810 11    of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few
P26 0820 10    moments before, and I wanted to run down there and
P26 0830  6    halt, if I could, that frenetic pirouette, catch the
P26 0840  2    boy in the moment of his savagery, and save a glimmer,
P26 0840 13    a remnant, of that which I remembered, but I knew it
P26 0850 10    was already too late. I drove the tractor on, not looking
P26 0860  7    down there; I was afraid to look for fear the evil
P26 0870  5    might still be going on. My head began to ache, and
P26 0880  1    the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes, and
P26 0880 12    I hated the job suddenly, and I thought, there are
P26 0890  7    only moments when one sees beautiful things, and these
P26 0900  4    are soon crushed, or they vanish. I felt the anger
P26 0910  2    mount within me.
P26 0910  5       The boy waited at the corner, with the jar of water
P26 0920  4    held up to me in his hands, and the water had grown
P26 0920 16    bubbly in the heat of the morning. I knew the boy well.
P26 0930 12    He was eleven and we had done many things together.
P26 0940  7    He was a beautiful boy, really, with finely-spun blonde
P26 0950  4    hair and a smooth and still effeminate face, and his
P26 0960  2    eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike, and his
P26 0960 11    eyes were blue. He waited there and he smiled as the
P26 0970  9    tractor came up, as he would smile on any other day.
P26 0980  6    He was my nephew, my brother's son, handsome and warm
P26 0990  3    and newly-scrubbed, with happiness upon his face and
P26 0990 12    his face resembled my brother's and mine as well.
P26 1000  8       I saw then, too, the stake driven straight and hard
P26 1010  7    into the plowed soil, through something there where
P26 1020  3    I had been not long before.
P26 1020  9       I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy
P26 1030  7    came eagerly up to me. "Can I ride around with you"?
P26 1040  5    he asked, as he often did, and I had as often let him
P26 1050  3    be on the tractor beside me. I looked closely at his
P26 1050 14    eyes, and he was already innocent; the killing was
P26 1060  9    already forgotten in that clear mind of his.
P26 1070  6       "No, you cannot", I said, pushing aside the water
P26 1080  4    jar he offered to me. I pointed to the splintered,
P26 1080 14    upright stake. "Did you do that"? I asked.
P26 1090  8       "Yes", he said, eagerly, beginning a kind of dance
P26 1100  8    of excitement. "I killed a snake; it was a big one".
P26 1110  8    He tried to take my hand to show me.
P26 1120  2       "Why did you kill it"?
P26 1120  7       "Snakes are ugly and bad".
P26 1130  2       "This snake was very beautiful. Didn't you see how
P26 1140  2    beautiful it was"?
P26 1140  5       "Snakes are ugly", he said again.
P26 1150  1       "You saw the colors of it, didn't you? Have you
P26 1150 11    ever seen anything like it around here"?
P26 1160  7       "Snakes are ugly and bad, and it might have bitten
P26 1170  7    somebody, and they would have died".
P26 1180  1       "You know there are no poisonous snakes in this
P26 1180 10    area. This snake could not harm anything".
P26 1190  6       "They eat chickens sometimes", the boy said. "They
P26 1200  5    are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes".
P26 1210  3       "You are talking foolishly", I said. "You killed
P26 1220  2    it because you wanted to kill it, for no other reason".
P26 1220 13       "They're ugly and I hate them", the boy insisted.
P26 1230 10    "Nobody likes snakes".
P26 1240  3       "It was beautiful", I said, half to myself.
P26 1250  2       The boy skipped along beside me, and he was contented
P26 1260  1    with what he had done.
P26 1260  6       The fire of the colors was gone; there was a contorted
P26 1270  4    ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and
P26 1280  1    gray-looking, torn and smashed in, and dirty from the
P26 1280 11    boy's shoes. The beautifully-tapered head, so delicate
P26 1290  7    and so cool, had been flattened as if in a vise, and
P26 1300  7    the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted, torn
P26 1310  2    mouth. The snake was hideous, and I remembered, even
P26 1310 11    then, the cool, bright fire of it only a little while
P26 1320 10    before, and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen
P26 1330  7    it dead and hideous like that, and had not even stopped
P26 1340  4    to see the beauty of it in its life.
P26 1340 13       I wrenched the stake out, that the boy had driven
P26 1350  9    through it in the thickest part of its body, between
P26 1360  6    the colored diamond crystals. I touched it and the
P26 1370  3    coolness, the ice-feeling, was gone, and even then
P26 1370 12    it moved a little, perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead
P26 1380  9    muscles, and I hoped that it was truly dead, so that
P26 1390  6    I would not have to kill it. And then it moved a little
P26 1400  3    more, and I knew the snake was dying, and I would have
P26 1410  1    to kill it there. The boy stood off a few feet and
P26 1410 13    he had the stake again and he was racing innocently
P26 1420  6    in circles, making the buzzing tractor sound with his
P26 1430  4    lips.
P26 1430  5       I'm sorry, I thought to the snake, for you were
P26 1440  4    beautiful. I took the broken length of it around the
P26 1440 14    tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit
P26 1450 12    and I struck its head, not looking at it, to kill it
P26 1460  9    at last, for it could never live.
P26 1470  1       The boy came around behind me, dragging the stake.
P26 1470 10    "It's a big snake, isn't it"? he said. "I'm going to
P26 1480 11    tell everybody how big a snake I killed".
P26 1490  7       "Don't you see what you have done"? I said. "Don't
P26 1500  6    you see the difference now"?
P26 1510  1       "It's an ugly, terrible snake", he said. He came
P26 1510 10    up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes.
P26 1520 11    I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes, the gleeful
P26 1530  7    brutality.
P26 1530  8       "Don't", I said. I could have slapped the boy. He
P26 1540 10    looked up at me, puzzled, and he swayed his head from
P26 1550  7    side to side. I thought, you little brute, you nasty,
P26 1560  3    selfish, little beast, with brutality already developed
P26 1570  1    within that brain and in those eyes. I wanted to slap
P26 1570 12    his face, to wipe forever the insolence and brutal
P26 1580  7    glee from his mouth, and I decided then, very suddenly,
P26 1590  4    what I would do.
