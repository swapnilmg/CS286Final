H10 0010  1    In the same period, 431 presentations by members of
H10 0010 10    the staff were made to local, national, and international
H10 0020  6    medical groups.
H10 0030  1    _3. EDUCATION:_
H10 0030  1       _A._
H10 0030  2       The education function of the Institute is carried
H10 0040  1    on by the staff in the departments of pathology and
H10 0040 11    its consultants. During fiscal year 1959, six courses
H10 0050  7    were conducted: Forensic Pathology, Application of
H10 0060  3    Histochemistry to Pathology, Pathology of Diseases
H10 0070  1    of Laboratory Animals, Opthalmic Pathology, Pathology
H10 0070  7    of the Oral Regions, and a Cardiovasculatory Pathology
H10 0080  8    Seminar. During fiscal year 1960, seven courses were
H10 0090  7    conducted: Application of Histochemistry to Pathology,
H10 0100  4    Forensic Pathology, Pathology of Diseases of Laboratory
H10 0110  3    Animals, Pathology of the Oral Regions, Opthalmic Pathology,
H10 0120  2    Forensic Sciences Symposium, and Orthopedic Pathology.
H10 0130  1    From 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961, six courses
H10 0130 11    were conducted: Workshop in Resident Training in Pathology,
H10 0140  8    Pathology of Diseases of Laboratory Animals, Application
H10 0150  7    of Histochemistry of Pathology, Orthopedic Pathology,
H10 0160  5    Forensic Sciences Symposium, and Forensic Pathology.
H10 0170  4    _B._
H10 0170  5       During fiscal years 1959 and 1960, there were 139
H10 0180  5    military and civilian students who came to the Institute
H10 0190  1    for varying periods of special instruction.
H10 0200  1    _4. RESEARCH:_
H10 0200  1       The Institute is engaged in an extensive program
H10 0200  9    of medico-military scientific research in both morphological
H10 0210  6    and experimental pathology. Among the specific areas
H10 0220  5    of concentration in which the staff is engaged, are
H10 0230  2    such projects as biological and biochemical studies
H10 0230  9    of the effects of microwaves; study of motor end plates
H10 0240  9    in man and animals; investigation of respiratory diseases
H10 0260  5    of laboratory animals; metabolic responses to reduced
H10 0270  4    oxygen tension; neuropathology of nuclear and cosmic
H10 0280  3    radiation; carcinoma of prostate; evaluation of histochemical
H10 0290  1    techniques; and hip dysplasia in dogs. There has been
H10 0290 10    an increase in cooperative research with other Federal
H10 0300  8    agencies and civilian institutions.
H10 0310  2       During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January
H10 0320  3    1961, additional research affiliations were effected
H10 0320  9    with the U. S. Army Medical Research and Development
H10 0330  9    Command to conduct research in procedures for quantitative
H10 0340  7    electron microscopy, and for the study of biophysical
H10 0350  6    and biological studies of the structure and function
H10 0360  3    of ocular tissue. Also, the Defense Atomic Support
H10 0370  1    Agency sponsored a long-range study at this Institute
H10 0370 10    on the response of massive suspension cultures of mammalian
H10 0380  7    cells to acute radiation. Other scientific agencies,
H10 0390  4    both Federal and civilian, supported studies in quantitative
H10 0400  3    electron microscopical approach to microchemistry and
H10 0410  2    microcytochemistry; the investigation of the relationship
H10 0410  8    of diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthesizine enzyme
H10 0420  4    to tumor growth; morphological study and classification
H10 0430  4    of leukemia and lymphoma cases in animals; and the
H10 0440  4    study of structural changes in M. leprae and other
H10 0450  1    mycobacteria.
H10 0450  2    _MEDICAL ILLUSTRATION SERVICE_
H10 0450  5       _1._
H10 0450  6       The Medical Illustration Service is responsible
H10 0460  5    for the collection, publication, exhibition, and file
H10 0470  4    of medical illustration material of medico-military
H10 0480  1    importance to the Armed Forces. In addition to maintaining
H10 0490  1    a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases,
H10 0490  9    wounds, and injuries of military importance, it provides
H10 0500  6    facilities for clinical photography, photomicrography,
H10 0510  2    and medical arts, and operates a printing plant, by
H10 0520  3    permission of Congressional Committee, for publication
H10 0520  9    of an "Atlas of Tumor Pathology". It also maintains
H10 0530  9    shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits, training
H10 0540  7    aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of
H10 0550  6    films and teaching lantern slide sets.
H10 0560  1    _2._
H10 0560  1       During this period, a total of 762 exhibits were
H10 0560 10    presented at 442 medical and scientific meetings. Of
H10 0570  6    these exhibits, 154 were newly constructed. Twenty-nine
H10 0580  4    exhibits received awards.
H10 0580  7    _3._
H10 0580  8       Visual and operable training aids developed by the
H10 0590  7    Medical Illustration Service, were used in support
H10 0600  5    of Army Medical Service mass casualty exercises. Members
H10 0610  2    of the Medical Illustration Service lectured and conducted
H10 0620  2    demonstrations on the use of training aids to military
H10 0620 11    personnel and various civilian medical organizations.
H10 0630  6    Demonstrations of new and projected training aids were
H10 0640  6    conducted at the Medical Service Instructor's Conference,
H10 0650  3    Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas.
H10 0660  1    _4._
H10 0660  1       In support of the emphasis placed by the Department
H10 0660 10    of Defense on instruction in emergency medical care,
H10 0670  7    the Medical Illustration Service developed casualty
H10 0680  4    simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which
H10 0690  2    are being field tested; and overhead projector transparency
H10 0700  1    sets on the subjects of Military Sanitation: First
H10 0700  9    Aid for Soldiers; Bandaging and Splinting; the Emergency
H10 0710  7    Medical Treatment Unit, Phase I; and Emergency War
H10 0720  7    Surgery in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
H10 0730  7    (NATO) Handbook. Fifty lantern slide teaching sets
H10 0740  6    on the subject of "Emergency War Surgery (NATO)" were
H10 0750  4    assembled and distributed to the Medical Military Services
H10 0760  3    of foreign Governments associated with NATO and South-East
H10 0770  4    Asia Treaty Organization. The British and Canadian
H10 0780  2    Liaison Officers, as well as Office of Civil and Defense
H10 0790  1    Mobilization, the American Red Cross, and similar interested
H10 0790  9    organizations were informed from time to time as training
H10 0800  9    aids were developed.
H10 0810  1    _5._
H10 0810  2       Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were
H10 0810  9    developed and distributed, and lantern slide teaching
H10 0820  7    sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan
H10 0830  7    library of the Medical Illustration Service. Illustrations
H10 0840  3    were prepared for 11 Department of the Army manuals
H10 0850  2    and one Graphic Training Aid. Sixteen lantern slide
H10 0850 10    sets were loaned to the Government of India and eight
H10 0860 10    sets were forwarded to the U.S. Embassy, Managua, Nicaragua
H10 0870  7    for the Educational Exchange Program. The Senate Subcommittee
H10 0880  6    on Reorganization and International Organizations was
H10 0890  4    provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal
H10 0900  5    health produced by the Medical Illustration Service.
H10 0910  2    _6._
H10 0910  3       Six fascicles (10,000 copies each) of the "Atlas
H10 0920  1    of Tumor Pathology" were completed during the period
H10 0920  9    of this report.
H10 0930  1    _THE AMERICAN REGISTRY OF PATHOLOGY_
H10 0930  6       This consists of 25 individual registries, two of
H10 0940  4    which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 (the
H10 0950  2    Registry of Forensic Pathology and the Testicular Tumor
H10 0960  1    Registry). These registries are sponsored by 18 national
H10 0960  9    medical, dental, and veterinary societies and have
H10 0970  7    as their mission the assembling of selected cases of
H10 0980  5    interest to military medicine and of establishing through
H10 0990  2    the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural
H10 1000  1    history of various diseases of military-medical importance.
H10 1000  9    The American Registry of Pathology operates as a cooperative
H10 1010  8    enterprise in medical research and education between
H10 1020  6    the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian
H10 1030  5    medical profession on a national and international
H10 1040  1    basis, under such conditions as may be agreed upon
H10 1040 10    between the National Research Council and The Surgeons
H10 1050  8    General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The staff
H10 1060  7    utilized the collected material in these registries
H10 1070  4    for numerous lectures to national and international
H10 1080  1    meetings, exhibits, and published studies. During the
H10 1080  8    period of this report, 37,470 new cases were entered
H10 1090  7    into the various registries. These were selected carefully
H10 1100  5    and included not only detailed clinical information
H10 1110  2    but adequate pathology of value for research and educational
H10 1120  1    purposes.
H10 1120  2       In this same period, six new fascicles of the Atlas
H10 1130  1    of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to
H10 1130  9    medical centers world-wide. There were 54,320 copies
H10 1140  7    of fascicles sold and 642 copies distributed free during
H10 1150  5    this period. Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic Conferences
H10 1160  2    were prepared, bringing the total to 61 available for
H10 1170  2    loan distribution. Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic
H10 1170  9    Conference sets were prepared, which makes a total
H10 1180  8    of 70 types of teaching sets for loan. During this
H10 1190  6    period, 7,827 teaching sets were distributed on loan.
H10 1200  3    The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged
H10 1210  1    as of great value and in consequent great demand by
H10 1210 11    the small isolated military hospitals. The demand for
H10 1220  6    teaching sets continues unabated since they provide
H10 1230  4    the means for the military physicians to review the
H10 1240  2    pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems
H10 1240 10    for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical
H10 1250  8    physiological behavior with structural changes.
H10 1260  4    _THE MEDICAL MUSEUM_
H10 1260  7       In fiscal year 1959, the Medical Museum was moved
H10 1270  6    to Chase Hall, a temporary building on Independence
H10 1280  3    Avenue at Ninth Street, Southwest, and continued to
H10 1290  2    display to the public the achievements of the Armed
H10 1290 11    Forces Medical Services. During the period of this
H10 1300  7    report, 63 panel exhibits depicting the latest developments
H10 1310  5    in medical research were displayed. Of the 375 exhibits
H10 1320  5    (of all types) shown, 161 were new or refurbished.
H10 1330  1    Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished,
H10 1330  9    254 were prepared for other agencies. Eighty-five specimens
H10 1340  7    were loaned for study purposes. An exhibit, "Macropathology-
H10 1350  5    An Ancient Art, A new Science", was presented at the
H10 1360  6    annual meeting of the American Medical Association.
H10 1370  2       A three-dimensional exhibit depicting "A Century
H10 1380  2    of Naval Medicine" was formally presented to The Director
H10 1390  1    by George S. Squibb, great-grandson of the founder
H10 1390 10    of E. R. Squibb and Sons, for permanent display in
H10 1400  9    the Museum.
H10 1410  1       Space was provided for short-time guest medical
H10 1410  9    exhibits, and the Museum collected new accessions of
H10 1420  6    microscopes, medical, surgical, and diagnostic instruments,
H10 1430  3    uniform, and similar items of historical medico-military
H10 1450  1    significance.
H10 1450  2       During the period, the laboratory rendered centralized
H10 1460  2    macropathological service to qualified requesters.
H10 1470  1    Specimens were mounted for military installations,
H10 1470  7    governmental agencies, and medical schools.
H10 1480  4       Three hundred five copies of the Manual of Macropathological
H10 1490  3    Techniques were distributed. Thirty-five military and
H10 1500  3    civilian students received laboratory training.
H10 1510  1       During fiscal years 1959 and 1960, there were 795,586
H10 1510 10    visitors to the Museum.
H10 1520  2       During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January
H10 1540  1    1961, the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary
H10 1540 11    Building "S" on the Mall from Chase Hall. Throughout
H10 1550  9    the period and during the movement operation, the Museum
H10 1560  8    continued its functional support of the Armed Forces
H10 1570  6    Institute of Pathology.
H10 1570  9    #ARMED FORCES MEDICAL PUBLICATION AGENCY#
H10 1580  4    The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency, established
H10 1590  3    in 1949, has published, since January 1950, the United
H10 1600  3    States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice
H10 1605  1    publication to furnish material of professional interest
H10 1610  7    to Medical Department officers of the three military
H10 1620  6    services. Its supplement, the Medical Technicians Bulletin,
H10 1630  3    supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel.
H10 1640  3    These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical
H10 1650  2    Bulletin, published continuously from 1907 through
H10 1650  8    1959, as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly
H10 1660  8    and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department,
H10 1670  7    published from 1922 to 1949. In addition, their establishment
H10 1680  5    made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated
H10 1690  4    Air Force medical bulletin. Estimated annual savings
H10 1700  2    resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin
H10 1710  1    on a triservice basis, as compared with the cost of
H10 1710 11    producing separate periodicals for each service, were
H10 1720  6    between $65,000 and $70,000. Additionally, on the many
H10 1730  4    ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations, the
H10 1740  2    availability of the Journal removed the necessity of
H10 1740 10    subscribing to several additional journals of civilian
H10 1750  7    origin over and above the quantity now authorized,
H10 1760  4    in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage.
H10 1770  2       From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960, 24 numbers of
H10 1780  1    the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published.
H10 1790  9    Each Journal contained articles of professional and
H10 1800  5    clinical interest, and departments devoted to military
H10 1810  4    medical news, reviews of new books, and other features
H10 1820  1    of interest to officers of the medical services. The
H10 1820 10    Council on National Defense of the American Medical
H10 1830  8    Association contributed a brief article to each issue
H10 1840  7    entitled, "This is Your A.M.A.".
H10 1850  1       Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal,
H10 1860  1    the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction
H10 1860 11    was changed from varityping to hot typesetting. This
H10 1870  8    resulted in an improved appearance, but was followed
H10 1880  5    by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the
H10 1890  3    institution of major economies to keep within the total
H10 1900  1    of allocated funds. The use of 100 instead of 140 substance
H10 1900 12    paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning
H10 1910  8    with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently
H10 1920  4    to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly
H10 1930  2    $4,000 in unexpended funds.
H10 1930  6       Two special issues were published, one for November
H10 1940  5    1959 on Space Medicine, the other the Tenth Anniversary
H10 1950  3    issue for January 1960. The February 1960 issue marked
H10 1960  2    the reinstitution of the section entitled, "The Medical
H10 1960 10    Officer Writes". Replacing the discontinued Medical
H10 1970  6    Technicians Bulletin, publication of which was suspended
H10 1980  6    with the November-December 1959 issue, a section called
H10 1990  6    "Technical Notes" was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis
H10 2000  5    beginning with the April 1960 issue. Occasional features
H10 2010  2    were published on historical medicine, special reports,
H10 2010  9    bibliography, and "Collector's Items". In May 1960,
H10 2020  7    the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series
H10 2030  8    of articles on the "Medical Museum", and in June, the
H10 2040  6    Institute started contributing a regular monthly "Case
H10 2050  5    for Diagnosis". The Institute also planned to furnish
H10 2060  3    a regular series of articles, beginning in the fall
H10 2070  1    of 1960, on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.
H10 2070  9       The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to
H10 2080  6    submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions,
H10 2090  7    so that each commission will report once a year on
H10 2100  5    some phase of its work calculated to be of particular
H10 2100 15    interest and value to medical officers of the Armed
H10 2110  9    Forces. The first report in this continuing series
H10 2120  6    appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal.
