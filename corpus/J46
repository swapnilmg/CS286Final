J46 0010  1       THE vast Central Valley of California is one of
J46 0010 10    the most productive agricultural areas in the world.
J46 0020  7    During the summer of 1960, it became the setting for
J46 0030  6    a bitter and basic labor-management struggle.
J46 0040  1       The contestants in this economic struggle are the
J46 0040  9    Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) of
J46 0050  6    the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the
J46 0060  7    State. By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the
J46 0070  6    Department of Employment in the farm placement program,
J46 0080  4    we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between
J46 0090  1    these two forces. It is not a pleasant or easy position,
J46 0090 12    but one we have endeavored to maintain. We have sought
J46 0100  9    to be strictly neutral as between the parties, but
J46 0110  6    at the same time we have been required frequently to
J46 0120  3    rule on specific issues or situations as they arose.
J46 0120 12       Inevitably, one side was pleased and the other displeased,
J46 0130 10    regardless of how we ruled. Often the displeased parties
J46 0140  9    interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward
J46 0150  5    the other. We have consoled ourselves with the thought
J46 0160  4    that this is a normal human reaction and is one of
J46 0170  2    the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding.
J46 0170 11    It is disconcerting, nevertheless, to read in a labor
J46 0180  9    weekly, "Perluss knuckles down to growers", and then
J46 0190  7    to be confronted with a growers' publication which
J46 0200  3    states, "Perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumped-up
J46 0210  3    strikes as bona fide".
J46 0210  7       For a number of years, there have been sporadic
J46 0220  5    attempts in California to organize farm workers. These
J46 0230  2    attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons.
J46 0240  1    They were inadequately financed, without experienced
J46 0240  7    leadership, and lacked the general support of organized
J46 0250  7    labor as a whole. This past year the pattern has been
J46 0260  6    different: The organizing program had the full support
J46 0270  3    of the AFL-CIO, which supplied staff and money to
J46 0280  2    the AWOC, as well as moral support. Leadership was
J46 0280 11    experienced and skillful, and financial resources were
J46 0290  7    significant. Regardless of where personal sympathies
J46 0300  5    may lie as between the parties, failure to recognize
J46 0310  3    these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts
J46 0320  1    of life.
J46 0320  3       As a result of these changed conditions, the impact
J46 0330  1    of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management
J46 0330  9    relations has been much greater than in the past. The
J46 0340 10    AWOC has been able to employ the traditional weapons
J46 0350  6    of labor- the strike and the picket line- with considerable
J46 0370  3    success, particularly in the area of wages.
J46 0380  1       By the very nature of the situation, it is the union
J46 0380 12    which has been able to select the time and place to
J46 0390 11    bring pressure upon management. To date, at least,
J46 0400  5    the strategy of the AWOC has been selective; that
J46 0410  3    is to say, to concentrate on a particular crop or activity
J46 0420  1    in a particular area at a strategic time, rather than
J46 0420 11    any broadside engagement with management throughout
J46 0430  5    an area or the State.
J46 0440  1       Primarily, we became involved in these disputes
J46 0440  8    because of our referral obligations under our farm
J46 0450  5    placement program. Normally, because agricultural labor
J46 0460  3    is not covered by unemployment insurance, we would
J46 0470  1    not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments
J46 0470 10    under the trade dispute provision of the Unemployment
J46 0480  6    Insurance Code, although such a situation is quite
J46 0490  6    within the realm of possibility. But the current issues
J46 0500  2    arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals
J46 0520  1    to an establishment where a labor dispute exists, and
J46 0520 10    out of Public Law 78 and the Migrant Labor Agreement
J46 0530  8    if Mexican nationals were employed at the ranch.
J46 0540  5       Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser
J46 0550  1    Act in its historical sense, as a major milestone in
J46 0550 11    the development of public placement services. Infrequently
J46 0560  7    do we think of it as a living, continuing, operating
J46 0570  8    control over the system. However, when labor disputes
J46 0580  4    arise, its provisions come clearly into play. California
J46 0590  2    has accepted the provisions of that Act (as have all
J46 0590 12    other States) by enacting into our Code (Section 2051)
J46 0600  9    a provision that
J46 0610  1       The State of California accepts the provisions of
J46 0610  9    the Wagner-Peyser Act, ... and will observe and comply
J46 0620 10    with the requirements of that act.
J46 0630  4       With respect to labor disputes, the Wagner-Peyser
J46 0640  1    Act states only,
J46 0640  4       In carrying out the provisions of this Act, the
J46 0650  5    Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for
J46 0660  1    the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants
J46 0660 12    before they are referred to employment.
J46 0680  1       Other provisions of the Act empower the Secretary
J46 0690  3    to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions,
J46 0700  1    and he has done so. The pertinent regulation for our
J46 0700 11    purposes is Section 602.2 (b), as follows:
J46 0710  7       Referrals in labor dispute situations. No person
J46 0720  5    shall be referred to a position the filling of which
J46 0730  4    will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which
J46 0740  1    (1) is vacant because the former occupant is on strike
J46 0740 11    or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute,
J46 0750  9    or (2) the filling of which is an issue in a labor
J46 0760  7    dispute. With respect to positions not covered by subparagraph
J46 0770  3    (1) or (2) of this paragraph, any individual may be
J46 0780  1    referred to a place of employment in which a labor
J46 0780 11    dispute exists, provided he is given written notice
J46 0790  6    of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral.
J46 0800  4       In analyzing this regulation, let us take the last
J46 0810  3    sentence first. It permits referrals under certain
J46 0810 10    circumstances even when there is a labor dispute, provided
J46 0820  9    the individual is given written notice of such a dispute.
J46 0830  8    Assume, for example, a situation where a farm has a
J46 0840  6    packing shed and fields. The packing shed workers go
J46 0850  2    on strike. There is no dispute involving fieldwork.
J46 0850 10    We concluded that we may refer workers to the fieldwork
J46 0860  9    (but not the packing shed work) provided we give them
J46 0870  6    written notice of the packing shed dispute. So far,
J46 0880  3    no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision.
J46 0890  1       It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently
J46 0890 12    at issue. Note that it prohibits referrals under either
J46 0900  8    condition (1) or condition (2). Employer representatives
J46 0910  6    have contended that the Secretary has gone beyond his
J46 0920  5    authority by such a prohibition, on the grounds that
J46 0930  3    the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice
J46 0930 11    to the prospective worker that a dispute exists.
J46 0940  8    #INTO COURT#
J46 0940 10    The matter got into the courts this way: One of the
J46 0950 10    early strikes called by the AWOC was at the DiGiorgio
J46 0960  8    pear orchards in Yuba County. We found that a labor
J46 0970  6    dispute existed, and that the workers had left their
J46 0980  2    jobs, which were then vacant because of the dispute.
J46 0980 11    Accordingly, under clause (1) of the Secretary's Regulation,
J46 0990  8    we suspended referrals to the employer. (Incidentally,
J46 1000  6    no Mexican nationals were involved.) The employer,
J46 1010  4    seeking to continue his harvest, challenged our right
J46 1020  3    to cease referrals to him, and sought relief in the
J46 1020 13    Superior Court of Yuba County. The court issued a temporary
J46 1030 10    restraining order, directing us to resume referrals.
J46 1040  7    We, of course, obeyed the court order. However, the
J46 1050  4    Attorney General of California, at the request of the
J46 1060  3    Secretary of Labor, sought to have the jurisdiction
J46 1060 11    over the issue removed to the Federal District Court,
J46 1070  9    on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue
J46 1080  7    since the validity of the Secretary's Regulation was
J46 1090  3    being challenged. However, the Federal Court held that
J46 1100  3    since the State had accepted the provisions of the
J46 1100 12    Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code, and presumably
J46 1110  8    therefore also the regulations, it was now a State
J46 1120  7    matter. It accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction,
J46 1130  2    whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining
J46 1140  2    order permanent. Under that order, we have continued
J46 1140 10    referring workers to the ranch. A similar case arose
J46 1150  9    at the Bowers ranch in Butte County, and the Superior
J46 1160  7    Court of that county issued similar restraining orders.
J46 1170  3       The growers have strenuously argued that I should
J46 1180  4    have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive
J46 1190  1    and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore
J46 1190 10    this provision in the Secretary's Regulation. I cannot
J46 1200  7    accept that view, either as a lawyer or as an administrator.
J46 1210  9    #LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS#
J46 1210 11    First, let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations
J46 1220 10    involved. It is an accepted juridical principle in
J46 1230  8    California that a Superior Court decision does not
J46 1240  5    constitute a binding legal precedent. It is conclusive,
J46 1250  3    unless appealed, only upon the particular parties to
J46 1260  1    the particular action which was heard. It is not binding
J46 1260 11    upon another Superior Court, which could rule to the
J46 1270  8    contrary. Only when a decision is rendered by the District
J46 1280  6    Court of Appeal (or, of course, the Supreme Court)
J46 1290  3    is a binding precedent established. In that event,
J46 1300  1    we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative
J46 1300 11    interpretation of the matter, and one which we can
J46 1310  9    follow statewide with confidence that the policy will
J46 1320  5    not be overthrown in other Superior Courts.
J46 1330  1       But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding
J46 1330 11    precedent decision, I am convinced that the decisions
J46 1340  8    of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the
J46 1350  6    Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation
J46 1360  3    of the Secretary's power under the Federal law. I believe
J46 1370  4    I am in good company in this view. The Attorney General
J46 1380  1    of California concurs in this interpretation and has
J46 1380  9    filed an appeal from these decisions to the District
J46 1390  7    Court of Appeal. The Attorney General of the United
J46 1400  5    States, in considering the power of the Secretary to
J46 1410  3    issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act
J46 1420  1    relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers,
J46 1420  9    has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority. Further,
J46 1430  7    and as an evidence of legislative intent only, the
J46 1440  5    Senate of the United States recently defeated by a
J46 1450  4    substantial majority the "Holland Amendment" to the
J46 1460  1    Fair Labor Standards Act, which would have specifically
J46 1460  9    limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in
J46 1470  8    these matters.
J46 1480  1       Next, let us consider briefly the program and administrative
J46 1480  9    implications of a failure on our part to pursue our
J46 1490 10    appeals.
J46 1490 11       There is far too much at stake for all of the parties
J46 1500 10    concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair. The
J46 1510  5    ramifications of the issue are enormous. A decision
J46 1520  2    to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike
J46 1520 12    would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural
J46 1530  7    situations, and might in effect place the public employment
J46 1540  6    services in the position of acting as strikebreakers.
J46 1550  3    The public interest is so dominant in such an issue
J46 1560  1    that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle
J46 1560 12    it by an administrative order based upon conclusions
J46 1570  5    reached in a summary action in one or two Superior
J46 1580  6    Courts in the State. It is an issue which may well
J46 1590  3    reach the Supreme Court of the United States before
J46 1590 12    judicial finality is achieved.
J46 1600  4       As an administrator, I cannot place the Employment
J46 1610  3    Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance
J46 1620  1    with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues
J46 1620 12    of appeal open to me. To have applied statewide the
J46 1630 10    decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court,
J46 1640  6    in my opinion, would have placed us clearly out of
J46 1650  4    compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have
J46 1660  1    immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor,
J46 1660 10    were he so inclined, to notify the Governor of such
J46 1670  8    noncompliance, set a date for hearing, and issue his
J46 1680  5    finding. The impact of noncompliance under the Wagner-Peyser
J46 1690  4    Act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million a
J46 1700  2    year of administrative funds which finance our employment
J46 1700 10    service program or, as a corollary, the taking over
J46 1710  9    by the Federal Government of its operation.
J46 1720  4       Thus far, the cases which have come before the courts
J46 1730  3    have involved only the issue of referral where the
J46 1730 12    job is vacant due to a strike- condition (1) in the
J46 1740 10    Regulation of the Secretary. None has yet arisen under
J46 1750  6    condition (2), relating to referral to jobs "the filling
J46 1760  5    of which is an issue in a labor dispute".
J46 1770  1       Here the problem is essentially one of defining
J46 1770  9    the word "filling". Should it be defined in a narrow
J46 1780  8    sense to include only such elements as job specifications,
J46 1790  4    union membership, union jurisdiction, and the like?
J46 1800  3    Or should it have a broader connotation of including
J46 1800 12    wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated
J46 1810  8    with the mechanics of "filling" the job.
J46 1820  6       Because of the uncertainty of this definition, I
J46 1830  5    solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor.
J46 1840  3    He has advised me that the narrower interpretation
J46 1840 11    is the proper one; that is, that if wages, for example,
J46 1850 10    is the only issue in a labor dispute, and no workers
J46 1860  8    have left their jobs because of the dispute, we may
J46 1870  4    continue to make referrals.
