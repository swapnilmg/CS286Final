A41 0010  1       A philosopher may point out that the troubles of
A41 0010 10    the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently
A41 0020  7    will never end. But a historian might put his finger
A41 0030  5    on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope that
A41 0040  2    the troubles will sometime pass away. The man was King
A41 0040 12    Leopold II of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded
A41 0050  9    that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing
A41 0060  7    was still good. By force, he took under his protection,
A41 0070  3    or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central
A41 0080  1    Africa. This is an area nearly as large as Western
A41 0080 11    Europe; and it was filled then as now by quarreling
A41 0090 10    tribes with no political or historical unity. Its boundaries
A41 0100  6    had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings;
A41 0110  4    they were determined by the points at which Leopold's
A41 0120  1    explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.
A41 0120  8       The population of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided
A41 0130  8    into at least seven major "culture clusters" and innumerable
A41 0140  5    tribes speaking 400 separate dialects. The religions
A41 0150  4    of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism,
A41 0160  1    paganism, ancestor worship and animism. The climate
A41 0160  8    ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate.
A41 0170  7    The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants
A41 0180  4    or run over by sports cars. To make one nation out
A41 0190  3    of these disparities would be a problem large enough
A41 0190 12    in any case; it has been made far more difficult by
A41 0200 10    what the Belgians have done, or failed to do, in the
A41 0210  8    Congo since 1885.
A41 0210 11       At first the Belgian royal family administered the
A41 0220  6    Congo as its own private property. But by 1908 its
A41 0230  5    record of brutality had touched the national conscience.
A41 0240  1    The Belgian government itself took over administration,
A41 0240  8    commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the
A41 0250  8    history of colonialism. One definition of paternalism
A41 0260  5    is "The principle or practice, on the part of a government,
A41 0270  7    of managing the affairs of a country in the manner
A41 0280  3    of a father dealing with his children". The honor of
A41 0280 13    the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned-
A41 0290 10    only their judgment. Ordinarily a father permits his
A41 0300  6    children to grow up in due time- but when the colony
A41 0310  7    received independence in 1960 the Congolese child,
A41 0320  1    if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was
A41 0320 12    52 and had until then been treated as an infant.
A41 0330  7    ##
A41 0330  8    The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic
A41 0340  5    development of the Congo, which is rich in copper,
A41 0350  2    tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton
A41 0350 10    and palm oil. The colony was administered from Brussels,
A41 0360  8    with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians
A41 0370  6    having any vote. The beneficiaries of this administration
A41 0380  4    were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals
A41 0390  2    and the Belgian government itself held stock. In Inside
A41 0400  1    Africa, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe
A41 0400 10    Generale, as "the kind of colossus that might be envisaged
A41 0410 10    if, let us say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper,
A41 0420  8    the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, the
A41 0430  6    Pennsylvania Railroad, and various companies producing
A41 0440  3    agricultural products were lumped together, with the
A41 0450  2    United States government as a heavy partner".
A41 0450  9       Had they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might
A41 0460  8    have exploited the Congolese without compassion. But
A41 0470  4    they were not. They provided a social security system
A41 0480  3    which covered all their African employes; their program
A41 0490  1    of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the
A41 0490 11    continent; they put much effort into public housing.
A41 0500  8    They also instituted a ration system under which all
A41 0510  5    employers in the Congo were required to furnish their
A41 0520  2    employes with clothing and adequate food. But instead
A41 0520 10    of delivering the ration- either in actual commodities
A41 0530  8    or in cash- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a
A41 0540  8    month, the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more
A41 0560  6    often. Would not the children, if they received all
A41 0570  1    their food on the first day of the month, eat it up
A41 0570 13    immediately, and later go hungry?
A41 0580  4       The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education.
A41 0590  3    During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools
A41 0590 13    in the Congo. But almost all the schools were primary.
A41 0600 10    The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle
A41 0610  7    out the meaning of "la chatte" and "le chien" and write
A41 0620  6    his name. Some schools were technical- the Belgians
A41 0630  3    needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the
A41 0640  2    land, and trained many. But they did not believe in
A41 0640 12    widespread secondary education, much less in college.
A41 0650  7    It was their conviction that the people should be "brought
A41 0660  7    up together", a grade at a time, until in some indefinite
A41 0670  5    future some might be ready to tackle history, economics
A41 0680  2    and political science. Indeed, the Belgians discouraged
A41 0690  1    higher education, fearing the creation of a native
A41 0690  9    intellectual elite which might cause unrest. When the
A41 0700  7    Congo received its independence in 1960 there were,
A41 0710  5    among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university
A41 0720  1    graduates.
A41 0720  2    ##
A41 0720  3    Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony
A41 0730  2    so manifestly unprepared to accept it? In one large
A41 0730 11    oversimplification, it might be said that the Belgians
A41 0740  8    felt, far too late, the gale of nationalism sweeping
A41 0750  5    Africa. They lacked time to prepare the Congo, as the
A41 0760  5    British and French had prepared their colonies. The
A41 0770  1    Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even
A41 0770  8    though most were unsure what it meant; and in Brussels,
A41 0780  9    street crowds shouted, "Pas une goutte de sang!" (Not
A41 0790  7    one drop of blood!). The Belgians would not fight for
A41 0800  6    the privilege of being the detested pedagogue; rather
A41 0810  2    than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would
A41 0820  1    wash their hands of the mess. It is hard to blame them
A41 0820 13    for this. Yet there were other motivations and actions
A41 0830  7    which the Belgians took after independence for which
A41 0840  4    history may not find them guiltless.
A41 0850  1       As the time for independence approached there were
A41 0850  8    in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties, or
A41 0860  7    approximately eight for each university graduate. There
A41 0870  3    were four principal ones. First, there were those Congolese
A41 0880  2    (among them Joseph Kasavubu) who favored splitting
A41 0880  9    the country into small independent states, Balkanizing
A41 0890  7    it. Second, there were those (Moise Tshombe) who favored
A41 0900  7    near-Balkanization, a loose federalism having a central
A41 0910  5    government of limited authority, with much power residing
A41 0920  4    in the states. Third, there were those (notably Patrice
A41 0930  1    Lumumba) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong
A41 0930 11    central government. And fourth, there were moderates
A41 0940  7    who were in no hurry for independence and wished to
A41 0950  6    wait until the Congo grew up. However, the positions
A41 0960  3    of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.
A41 0970  1       A final factor which contributed greatly to the
A41 0970  9    fragmentation of the Congo, immediately after independence,
A41 0980  7    was the provincial structure that had been established
A41 0990  5    by the Belgians for convenience in administration.
A41 1000  1    They had divided the Congo into six provinces- Leopoldville,
A41 1010  1    Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern- unfortunately
A41 1020  1    with little regard for ethnic groupings. Thus some
A41 1020  9    provinces contained tribes which detested each other,
A41 1030  6    and to them independence meant an opportunity for war.
A41 1040  5       The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with
A41 1050  2    what seemed a workable Western-style form of government:
A41 1060  1    there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral
A41 1060 13    legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.
A41 1070  8    Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo
A41 1080  8    would quickly assume a respectable position in the
A41 1090  4    society of nations. If internal frictions arose, they
A41 1100  2    could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army,
A41 1100 11    the Force Publique, which had been trained and was
A41 1110  8    still officered by white Belgians. The president, Joseph
A41 1120  5    Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator and the premier,
A41 1130  4    Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.
A41 1130  9       Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen
A41 1140  7    commenced fighting each other. Presently the well-armed
A41 1150  7    members of the Force Publique- many of them drawn from
A41 1170  6    savage and even cannibalistic tribes, erupted in mutiny,
A41 1180  4    rioting, raping and looting. Terror engulfed the thousands
A41 1190  1    of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country.
A41 1190 10    The Belgian government decided to act, and on July
A41 1200  8    10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo. On July 11 the
A41 1210  8    head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga, Moise
A41 1220  3    Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from
A41 1230  1    the country. Confusion became chaos; each succeeding
A41 1230  8    day brought new acts of violence. Lumumba and Kasavubu
A41 1240  8    blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians,
A41 1250  5    and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to
A41 1260  5    oust them.
A41 1260  7    ##
A41 1260  8    On July 14 the Security Council- with France and Great
A41 1270  7    Britain abstaining- voted the resolution which drew
A41 1280  3    the U.N. into the Congo. Vague in wording, it called
A41 1290  2    for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the
A41 1290 10    Secretary-General "to take the necessary steps ...
A41 1300  7    to provide the [Congolese] Government with such military
A41 1310  5    assistance as may be necessary, until, through the
A41 1320  3    efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical
A41 1330  1    assistance of the United Nations, the national security
A41 1330  9    forces may be able, in the opinion of the Government,
A41 1340 10    to meet fully their tasks ...".
A41 1350  2       Secretary-General Hammarskjo^ld decided that it
A41 1360  1    would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the
A41 1360 11    Congo were to come from African, or at least nonwhite,
A41 1370  9    nations- certainly not from the U.S., Russia, Great
A41 1380  3    Britain or France. He quickly called on Ghana, Tunisia,
A41 1390  5    Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched troops within
A41 1400  3    hours. Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached
A41 1410  2    a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from
A41 1410 11    India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who
A41 1420 10    were the only whites.
A41 1430  1       It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest
A41 1430 11    form of order to the Congo. The Belgians were reluctant
A41 1440  9    to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N.
A41 1450  5    efforts. The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba
A41 1460  4    caused constant problems- he frequently announced that
A41 1470  2    he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with
A41 1480  1    the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help. (However,
A41 1480 10    there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was
A41 1490  8    a Communist. Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia,
A41 1500  7    he first appealed to the U.S. for military help, and
A41 1510  5    was rejected.) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s
A41 1520  3    mission by initiating small "wars" with the secessionist
A41 1530  2    province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under
A41 1540  1    Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well. Meanwhile
A41 1540  9    Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo,
A41 1550  7    sending Lumumba equipment for his "wars", dispatching
A41 1560  4    "technicians" and even threatening, on occasion, to
A41 1570  4    intervene openly.
A41 1570  6       But by the end of the three-month period, in October
A41 1580  4    1960, something approaching calm settled on the Congo.
A41 1590  3    President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba
A41 1590  9    and fired him. Lumumba fired Kasavubu. Control of the
A41 1600  9    government- such control as there was and such government
A41 1610  8    as there was- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu,
A41 1620  6    chief of staff of the Congolese army. Mobutu promptly
A41 1630  3    flung out the Russians, who have not since played any
A41 1640  1    significant part on the local scene, although they
A41 1640  9    have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N.
A41 1650  5    headquarters in New York. The Belgians- at least officially-
A41 1660  6    departed from the Congo as well, withdrawing all of
A41 1670  4    their uniformed troops. But they left behind them large
A41 1680  3    numbers of officers, variously called "volunteers"
A41 1680  9    or "mercenaries", who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe
A41 1690 10    in Katanga, the seceded province which, according to
A41 1700  7    Tshombe, holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire
A41 1710  7    country.
A41 1710  8       From October 1960 to February 1961, the U.N. forces
A41 1720  7    in the Congo took little action. There was no directive
A41 1730  5    for it- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned
A41 1740  4    political matters, and in any case the United Nations
A41 1750  2    by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the
A41 1750 13    political affairs of any nation, whether to unify it,
A41 1760  9    federalize it or Balkanize it.
A41 1770  2       During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered
A41 1770 10    and flickered throughout the Congo. In February the
A41 1780  8    murder of Patrice Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into
A41 1790  7    Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe, again stirred
A41 1800  4    the U.N. to action. On Feb. 21 the council passed another
A41 1810  4    resolution urging the taking of "all appropriate measures
A41 1820  2    to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo,
A41 1820 12    including ... the use of force, if necessary, in the
A41 1830 10    last resort". Although the resolution might have been
A41 1840  6    far more specific, it was considerably tougher than
A41 1850  3    the earlier one. It also urged that the U.N. eject,
A41 1860  2    and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign
A41 1860 12    military and political advisers; ordered an investigation
A41 1870  7    of Lumumba's death; urged the reconvention of the Congolese
A41 1880  8    Parliament and the reorganization of the army.
