G51 0010  1    Mando, pleading her cause, must have said that Dr.
G51 0010 10    Brown was the most distinguished physician in the United
G51 0020  7    States of America, for our man poured out his symptoms
G51 0030  7    and drew a madly waving line indicating the irregularity
G51 0040  3    of his pulse. "He's got high blood pressure, too, and
G51 0050  2    bum kidneys", the doctor said to me. "Transparent look,
G51 0050 11    waxy skin- could well be uremia". He looked disapprovingly
G51 0060  8    at an ash tray piled high with cigarette stubs, shook
G51 0070  8    his head, and moved his hand back and forth in a strong
G51 0080  8    negative gesture. The little official hung his head
G51 0090  4    in shame. Seeing this, his colleague at the next desk
G51 0100  1    gave a short, contemptuous laugh, pushed forward his
G51 0100  9    own ash tray, innocent of a single butt, thumped his
G51 0110  7    chest to show his excellent condition, and looked proud.
G51 0120  4    The doctor gravely nodded approval.
G51 0130  1       At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce
G51 0130 10    that the problem was solved and all Norton had to do
G51 0140  9    was to sign a sheaf of papers. We went out of the office
G51 0150  6    and down the hall to a window where documents and more
G51 0160  3    officials awaited us, the rest of the office personnel
G51 0160 12    hot upon our heels. By this time word had got around
G51 0170 11    that an American doctor was on the premises. One fellow
G51 0180  7    who had liver spots held out his hands to the great
G51 0190  5    healer. It was funny but it was also touching. "You
G51 0200  1    know", Norton said to me later, "I am thinking of setting
G51 0210  1    up the Klinico Brownapopolus. I might not make any
G51 0210 10    money but I'd sure have patients".
G51 0220  4       After luncheon we took advantage of the siesta period
G51 0230  4    to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our
G51 0240  1    dear friend Deppy had written. Deppy is Despina Messinesi,
G51 0240 10    a long-time member of the Vogue staff who, although
G51 0250  8    born in Boston, was born there of Greek parents. Several
G51 0260  5    years of her life have been spent in the homeland,
G51 0270  3    and she had written to friends to alert them of our
G51 0270 14    coming. "All you have to do, Ilka dear, is to phone
G51 0280 11    on your arrival. They are longing to see you". The
G51 0290  8    wear and tear of life have taught me that very few
G51 0300  5    friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers,
G51 0310  1    but I planned on being the soul of tact, of giving
G51 0310 12    them plenty of outs was there the tiniest implication
G51 0320  8    that their cups were already running over without us.
G51 0330  5    My diplomacy was needless. Greek phone service is worse
G51 0340  3    than French, so that it was to be some little time
G51 0340 14    before contact of any sort was established.
G51 0350  7       In the late afternoon Mando came back to fetch us,
G51 0360  7    and we drove to the Acropolis. We stopped first at
G51 0370  3    the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height
G51 0370 13    crowned by the Parthenon. The curving benches are broken,
G51 0380  9    chipped, tumbled, but still in place, as are the marble
G51 0390  9    chairs, the seats of honor for the legislators. The
G51 0400  5    carved statues of the frieze against the low wall are
G51 0420  3    for the most part headless, but their exquisitely graceful
G51 0420 12    nude and draped torsos and the kneeling Atlantes are
G51 0430  9    well preserved in their perfect proportion.
G51 0440  4       Having completed our camera work, we started our
G51 0450  3    climb. I suppose the same emotion holds, if to a lesser
G51 0460  1    degree, with any famous monument. Will it live up to
G51 0460 11    its reputation? The weight of fame and history is formidable,
G51 0470  9    and dreary steel engravings in schoolbooks do little
G51 0480  5    to quicken interest and imagination. Uh huh, we think,
G51 0490  4    looking at them, so that's the Parthenon. And then
G51 0500  1    perhaps one day we get to Athens. We are here! We've
G51 0500 12    come a long way and spent a lot of money. It had better
G51 0510 12    be good. Don't worry about the Acropolis. It is awe-inspiring.
G51 0520  8    Probably every visitor has a favorite time for his
G51 0530  7    first sight of it. We saw it frequently afterward,
G51 0540  2    but our suggestion for the very first encounter is
G51 0540 11    near sunset. The light at that time is a benediction.
G51 0550  9    The serene, majestic columns of the Parthenon, tawny
G51 0560  6    in color against the pure deep blue sky, frame incredible
G51 0570  3    vistas. All we wanted to do was to stand very quietly
G51 0580  1    and look and look and look.
G51 0580  7       More than twenty-four hundred years old, bruised,
G51 0590  4    battered, worn and partially destroyed, combining to
G51 0600  2    an astounding degree solidity and grace, it still stands,
G51 0600 11    incomparable testimony to man's aspiration. In 1687
G51 0610  7    the Turks, who had been in control of the city since
G51 0620  7    the fifteenth century, with a truly shattering lack
G51 0630  2    of prudence used the Parthenon as a powder magazine.
G51 0630 11    It was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding Venetian
G51 0640 11    army and the great central portion of the temple was
G51 0650  7    blown to smithereens.
G51 0650 10       Nearby is the temple of Athena. The architectural
G51 0660  8    feature, the caryatides upholding the portico, famous
G51 0670  5    around the world as the Porch of the Maidens, was referred
G51 0680  4    to airily by Mando as the Girls' Place. Another beautiful
G51 0690  3    building is the Propylaea, the entrance gate of the
G51 0700  1    Acropolis.
G51 0700  2       My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge-
G51 0710  3    besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed
G51 0710 11    the doors of the baptistery in Florence- is the three
G51 0720  9    styles of Greek columns. For some happy reason Doric,
G51 0730  6    Ionic, and Corinthian have always stuck in my mind.
G51 0740  5    Furthermore I can identify each design. It remained,
G51 0750  1    however, for Mando to teach me that Doric symbolized
G51 0750 10    strength, Ionic wisdom, and Corinthian beauty, the
G51 0760  7    three pillars of the ancient world. The columns of
G51 0770  5    the Parthenon are fluted Doric.
G51 0770 10       Another classic sight that gave us considerable
G51 0780  7    pleasure was the evzone sentry, in his ballet skirt
G51 0790  5    with great pompons on his shoes, who was patrolling
G51 0800  1    up and down in front of the palace. Gun on shoulder,
G51 0800 12    he would march smartly for a few yards, bring his heels
G51 0810 10    together with a click, make a brisk pirouette, skirts
G51 0820  6    flaring, and march back to his point of departure.
G51 0830  3    We did not dare speak to so exalted a being, but Norton
G51 0840  1    aimed his camera and shot him, so to speak, on the
G51 0840 12    rise, the split second between the halt and the turn.
G51 0850  7       The evening of our first day we drove with Christopher
G51 0860  6    and Judy Sakellariadis, who were friends and patients
G51 0870  3    of Norton, to dine at a restaurant on the shores of
G51 0880  1    the Aegean. On the way out Mr. Sakellariadis detoured
G51 0880 10    up a special hill from which one may obtain a matchless
G51 0890  9    view of the Acropolis lighted by night.
G51 0900  3       The great spectacle was a source of rancor, and
G51 0910  1    Son et Lumiere, which the French were trying to promote
G51 0910 11    with the Athenians, was the reason. These performances
G51 0930  6    were being staged at historical monuments throughout
G51 0940  3    Europe. By a combination of music, lighting effects,
G51 0950  2    and narration, famous events that have transpired in
G51 0955  1    these locations are evoked and re-created for large
G51 0960  9    audiences usually to considerable acclaim. The Acropolis
G51 0970  5    had been scheduled for the treatment too, but apparently
G51 0980  4    it was to take place at the time of the full moon when
G51 0990  3    the Athenians themselves, out of respect for the natural
G51 0990 12    beauty of the occasion, were wont to forgo their own
G51 1000 10    usual nocturnal illumination.
G51 1010  1       Athenian society was split into two factions, the
G51 1010  9    Philistines and the Artists. The Artists contended
G51 1020  7    that the Philistines, gross of soul, were all for having
G51 1030  8    Son et Lumiere, since the French were footing the bill
G51 1040  6    and the attraction, wherever it had been done, had
G51 1050  3    proven popular. This was the crassest kind of materialism
G51 1060  1    and they, the Artists, would have no truck with it.
G51 1060 11    The Acropolis was unique in the world and if that imcomparable
G51 1070 10    work flooded by moonlight wasn't enough for both natives
G51 1080  6    and tourists, then they were quite simply barbarians
G51 1090  1    and the hell with them. It was very stimulating.
G51 1100  1       The restaurant to which the Sakellariadises took
G51 1100  8    us on this night of controversy was the Asteria, on
G51 1110  7    Asteria beach. This is a public bathing beach, easily
G51 1120  4    accessible by tramway from the center of Athens. Office
G51 1130  2    workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during
G51 1140  1    the siesta period, which, during the summer, lasts
G51 1140  9    from two until five in the afternoon, when shops and
G51 1150  7    offices are again open for business. They close sometime
G51 1160  4    after eight. Nine o'clock is the rush hour, when the
G51 1170  3    busses are jammed, and by nine-thirty the restaurants
G51 1170 12    are beginning to fill. Bedtime is late, for the balmy
G51 1180  9    evenings are delightful and everyone wants to linger
G51 1190  6    under the stars.
G51 1190  9       The sand is fine and pleasant, the cabanas are clean,
G51 1200  7    and the parasols, green, raspberry, and butter yellow,
G51 1210  4    are very gay. Although open to the general public it
G51 1220  3    is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive
G51 1230  1    private beach club at home. We went there a couple
G51 1230 11    of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.
G51 1240  5    This agreeable state of affairs is explicable, I think,
G51 1250  4    on two counts. One is Greece is not yet suffering from
G51 1260  2    overpopulation. The public may still find pleasure
G51 1260  9    in public places. The other is that the charge for
G51 1270  9    cabanas and parasols, though modest from an American
G51 1280  5    point of view, still is a little high for many Athenians.
G51 1290  3    We were struck by the notable absence of banana skins
G51 1300  1    and beer cans, but just so that we wouldn't go overboard
G51 1300 12    on Greek refinement, perfection was side-stepped by
G51 1310  7    a couple of braying portable radios. Greek boys and
G51 1320  5    girls also go for rock-and-roll, and the stations most
G51 1330  2    tuned to are those carrying United States overseas
G51 1330 10    programs. A good deal of English was spoken on the
G51 1340 10    beach, most educated Greeks learn it in childhood,
G51 1350  5    and there were also American wives and children of
G51 1360  3    our overseas servicemen.
G51 1360  6       For a delightful drive out of Athens I should recommend
G51 1370  6    Sounion, at the end of the Attic Peninsula. The road,
G51 1380  3    a comparatively new one, is very good, winding along
G51 1390  1    inlets, coves, and bays of deep and brilliant blue.
G51 1390 10    I suppose the day will inevitably come when the area
G51 1400  8    will be encrusted with developments, but at present
G51 1410  4    it is deserted and seductive. Three beneficial hurdles
G51 1420  2    to progress are the lack of water, electricity, and
G51 1420 11    telephones.
G51 1430  1       At Sounion there is a group of beautiful columns,
G51 1430 10    the ruins of a temple to Poseidon, of particular interest
G51 1440  9    at that time, as active reconstruction was in progress.
G51 1450  5    Gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins, and on the ground
G51 1460  5    segments of columns two and a half to three feet in
G51 1470  2    thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly
G51 1470  9    chiseled to match exactly the fluting and proportion
G51 1480  7    of the original. Later they would be hoisted into place.
G51 1490  6       There is a mediocre restaurant at Sounion and I
G51 1500  4    fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers
G51 1510  1    of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as
G51 1510 12    though it were nectar. I think its thirst had never
G51 1520  8    been assuaged before.
G51 1530  1       Norton and I dined one night in a sea-food restaurant
G51 1530 11    in Piraeus right on the water's edge. To enter it,
G51 1540  8    you go down five or six steps from the road. Across
G51 1550  5    the road is the kitchen, and waiters bearing great
G51 1560  1    trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their French
G51 1560 11    colleagues at the restaurant in the Place du Tertre
G51 1570  9    in Paris.
G51 1570 11       This restaurant, too, had a cat, a dusty, thin little
G51 1580  9    creature. How can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant?
G51 1590  9    But this one was. When offered a morsel it glanced
G51 1600  5    right and left and winced, obviously frightened and
G51 1610  2    expecting a kick, but too hungry not to snatch the
G51 1610 12    tidbit. Greece was one of the highlights of our trip,
G51 1620  9    but beginning in Greece and continuing around the world
G51 1630  4    throughout Southeast Asia the treatment of animals
G51 1640  2    was horrifying, ranging from callous indifference to
G51 1640  9    active cruelty. This of course was not true of the
G51 1650 10    educated and sophisticated people we met, who loved
G51 1660  6    their pets, but kindness is not a basic human instinct.
G51 1670  2       We met some charming Athenians, and among them our
G51 1680  1    chauffeur Panyotis ranked high. His English was limited,
G51 1680  9    and the little he knew he found irritating. A particularly
G51 1690  9    galling phrase was "O.K., Panyotis, we have time at
G51 1700  7    our disposal". This he claimed was the favorite refrain
G51 1710  6    of the English. They would be lolling under a tree
G51 1720  4    sipping Ouzo, relishing the leisurely life, assuring
G51 1730  1    him that the day was yet young.
