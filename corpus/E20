E20 0010  1       DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of
E20 0010 11    lower Pennsylvania. Any house built now below that
E20 0020  7    line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10
E20 0030  6    years. Fortunately, it is the FHA which has arrived
E20 0040  4    at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment
E20 0050  1    of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and
E20 0050 12    thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress. Even
E20 0060  8    if you live above that line, the FHA will back you,
E20 0070  6    for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning
E20 0080  4    in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged.
E20 0090  3       New simplified packaged units, recently devised
E20 0100  1    prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on
E20 0100  9    techniques make it possible to acquire a system for
E20 0110  8    an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to
E20 0120  5    $900. Two men can often do the installation in a day.
E20 0130  2    You can install it yourself- this is a central system
E20 0130 12    that will cool every part of your house. Its upkeep?
E20 0140  9    No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the
E20 0150  7    savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset
E20 0160  5    its operating costs.
E20 0170  1    _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_
E20 0170  1       Home air conditioning has come a long way from the
E20 0170 11    early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock
E20 0180  8    they inflicted. We know now that a 15-degree differential
E20 0190  7    in temperature is the maximum usually desirable, and
E20 0200  3    accurate controls assure the comfort we want.
E20 0210  1       We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer
E20 0210 11    cooling. On the contrary, there are fewer colds and
E20 0220  7    smaller doctor bills. The filtered air benefits allergies,
E20 0230  4    asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature and
E20 0240  2    humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.
E20 0240 12    Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the
E20 0250  7    stresses brought on by oppressive heat.
E20 0260  2       Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means less
E20 0270  2    time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry
E20 0270 12    cleaners, lighter loads for the washing machine. The
E20 0280  7    need for reupholstering, redecorating, repainting becomes
E20 0290  3    more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape better, and
E20 0300  3    mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.
E20 0300 10       It will improve your disposition. When you're less
E20 0310  8    fatigued, things just naturally look brighter. The
E20 0320  6    children can have their daytime naps and hot meals,
E20 0330  4    and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.
E20 0340  1    You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed
E20 0340  9    and free of hot weather nerves.
E20 0350  4       You can forget about screens, and leave the storm
E20 0360  2    windows up all year around.
E20 0360  7       Best of all, central air conditioning is something
E20 0370  3    you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin, the refrigerator,
E20 0380  3    a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years
E20 0390  1    or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty
E20 0390 11    low.
E20 0400  1    _FOR ANY HOUSE._
E20 0400  2       No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story,
E20 0400 12    Colonial or contemporary, central air conditioning
E20 0410  6    is easily installed. The equipment won't take up valuable
E20 0420  6    space either. It can go in out-of-the-way waste space.
E20 0430  3       But there's no denying that the easiest and most
E20 0440  3    economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning
E20 0450  1    is when you build. If that's done, the house can be
E20 0450 12    designed and oriented for best operation, and this
E20 0470  8    can mean savings both in the size of equipment and
E20 0480  5    in the cost of the house itself.
E20 0480 12       If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling
E20 0490 10    included when building, by all means make provision
E20 0500  6    for its easy adding later. Manufacturers have designed
E20 0510  3    equipment for just such circumstances, and your savings
E20 0520  2    over starting from scratch will be substantial.
E20 0520  9       If your house is to have a forced warm air system,
E20 0530 10    cooling can be a part of it. This costs less than having
E20 0540  7    a completely separate cooling system, for your regular
E20 0550  4    heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double
E20 0560  1    duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners
E20 0560 11    in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace
E20 0570 11    alone- high or low boy, horizontal or counterflow.
E20 0580  6    The units can be installed in basement, attic, crawlspace,
E20 0590  3    or in a closet located in the living area. The cooling
E20 0600  2    coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil
E20 0610  1    small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration
E20 0610  9    section set in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.
E20 0620  8       If you plan to add cooling later to your heating
E20 0630  6    system, there are things to watch for. Be sure ducts
E20 0640  4    that require insulation get it when they are installed.
E20 0650  1    They may be inaccessible later. Be sure your ducts
E20 0650 10    and blower are big enough to handle cooling. This is
E20 0660  8    especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone.
E20 0670  7    Be sure you get a perimeter heating system, and diffusers
E20 0680  3    that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating.
E20 0690  2       You can get a hot water system that will also work
E20 0700  1    for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water
E20 0700  9    is circulated instead of hot water. Instead of radiators
E20 0710  7    you'll have cooling-heating units, each with its own
E20 0720  6    thermostat. These systems are more expensive than year-'round
E20 0730  4    forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average
E20 0740  1    one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to
E20 0740 11    run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone.
E20 0750  7    _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._
E20 0750  9       If the problems of combining cooling with your heating
E20 0760  7    are knotty, it may be cheaper to plan on a completely
E20 0770  6    separate cooling system. The simplest kind of separate
E20 0780  3    system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in
E20 0780 13    effect, an oversize room conditioner equipped with
E20 0790  7    prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled,
E20 0800  5    cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.
E20 0810  1       In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be
E20 0810 11    installed, one serving the living area, the other the
E20 0820  9    sleeping zone. In a two-story house, one unit may be
E20 0830  6    installed in the basement to serve the first floor,
E20 0840  2    another in the attic to cool the second. In each case,
E20 0840 13    having separate systems for living and sleeping areas
E20 0850  8    has the advantage of permitting individual zone control.
E20 0860  5    _THE HEAT PUMP._
E20 0860  8       One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems
E20 0870  8    is one that can be switched to heating. As you know,
E20 0880  6    a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the
E20 0890  2    heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors.
E20 0890 12    A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses
E20 0900  5    the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward,
E20 0910  4    and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned
E20 0920  3    indoors.
E20 0920  4       Up until recently, this heat pump method of warming
E20 0930  3    air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and
E20 0930 13    when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now,
E20 0940  8    the machine has been improved to a point where it is
E20 0950  8    generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures
E20 0960  3    down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating
E20 0970  1    feature for as little as $200 more than the price of
E20 0970 12    cooling alone.
E20 0980  1       Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost,
E20 0980 10    for those emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard
E20 0990  8    holds up fuel delivery, or for cool summer mornings
E20 1000  6    or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole
E20 1010  4    heating plant.
E20 1010  6    _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_
E20 1010  9       How large a cooling unit you need, and the method
E20 1020  9    of its installation, depends on a variety of factors.
E20 1030  6    Among other things, besides the nature of your house
E20 1040  3    and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms
E20 1040 14    from the outside, it will depend upon your personal
E20 1050  9    habits and the makeup of your family. Families with
E20 1060  6    children usually don't want the house quite so cool.
E20 1070  4    If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity.
E20 1080  1    The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can
E20 1080 13    easily double your cooling load.
E20 1090  4       Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms
E20 1100  2    of BTU's. A BTU is a unit of heat, and the BTU rating
E20 1110  2    of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine
E20 1110 12    can pump out of your house in an hour. A very rough
E20 1120 12    rule of thumb is that, under favorable conditions,
E20 1130  5    you'll need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot
E20 1140  5    of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures have
E20 1150  2    a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the
E20 1150 13    high average is above that, less if it's below.
E20 1160  9       Coolers are also rated by tons. A ton of cooling
E20 1170  8    compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of
E20 1180  5    ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will
E20 1190  1    provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour.
E20 1190  9       You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower.
E20 1200  6    It is generally an inaccurate method of rating, for
E20 1210  5    the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, and
E20 1220  2    many other components beside it determine how much
E20 1220 10    cooling you'll get. A 1-hp conditioner, for example,
E20 1230  8    may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to
E20 1240  6    well over 10,000 BTU.
E20 1240 10       The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate
E20 1250  9    the size of the unit you need, rather than trying to
E20 1260  7    do this yourself.
E20 1260 10       Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra
E20 1270  9    cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough. Better
E20 1280  6    to have your equipment slightly undersized than too
E20 1290  3    big. Here's why:
E20 1290  6       Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling.
E20 1300  5    An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly,
E20 1310  1    then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles
E20 1310 11    on again, humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable
E20 1320  8    even though the temperature is still low. With a unit
E20 1330  7    of the right size, a compressor will run continuously
E20 1340  3    during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as
E20 1340 11    it does temperature.
E20 1350  3    _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._
E20 1350  6       Attention to details can cut in half the size unit
E20 1360  7    you need and pare operating expense proportionately.
E20 1370  1    A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably
E20 1370 11    cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year, or
E20 1380 11    $11 a month.
E20 1390  1       If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate
E20 1390 10    easily, your unit will have less heat to remove. Keep
E20 1400  8    the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won
E20 1410  5    the first battle. In a new house, generous roof overhangs
E20 1420  2    are a logical and effective solution. If the house
E20 1420 11    you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs,
E20 1430  9    you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off
E20 1440  7    walls and windows with properly designed trellises,
E20 1450  2    fences and awnings.
E20 1450  5       Shade trees, too, are a big help, so keep them if
E20 1460  5    you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good, but
E20 1470  2    not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside
E20 1470 12    of the house.
E20 1480  1       The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof,
E20 1480 10    the greater its heat impact. The way a house is set
E20 1490 10    on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling
E20 1500  4    you're going to need. A shift in the walls, or a change
E20 1510  4    in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely,
E20 1510 15    can save you money.
E20 1520  4       You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun,
E20 1530  2    double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.
E20 1530 10    Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides
E20 1540 10    of the house. They're easier to shade there. An attic
E20 1550  8    space above insulation makes a house easier to cool.
E20 1560  6    You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside
E20 1570  3    the conditioned space, and using an electric range
E20 1570 11    instead of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.
E20 1580 11       Insulate, weatherstrip, double-glaze to the maximum.
E20 1590  6    In insulation, the numbers to remember are 6-4-2. They
E20 1600  7    stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the
E20 1610  3    ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the
E20 1610 14    floors. Such extra-thick insulation not only permits
E20 1620  8    a much smaller cooling installation, but will continue
E20 1630  5    to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling.
E20 1640  4    A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per
E20 1650  2    cent.
E20 1650  3       It costs two to three times as much to remove a
E20 1650 14    BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter, so
E20 1660 12    every solitary BTU is worth attention. You'll foil
E20 1670  6    them in droves, along with their pal humidity, by having
E20 1680  6    and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a bathroom ventilator
E20 1690  3    for when you shower, and an outside vent for the clothes
E20 1700  2    drier.
E20 1700  3    _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._
E20 1700  6       It's no use pretending that all conditioners are
E20 1710  5    quiet, but the noise they produce can be kept to a
E20 1720  5    minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation,
E20 1730  1    so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award
E20 1730 10    the job on the basis of price alone.
E20 1740  6       Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom.
