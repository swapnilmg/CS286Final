J61 0010  1    Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century,
J61 0010 11    the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural
J61 0020  5    decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos
J61 0030  5    of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington.
J61 0040  1       The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained
J61 0040  8    in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard
J61 0050  9    of execution, and tended to overlook greatness of conception
J61 0060  6    where faults and weakness were easy to find. But it
J61 0070  6    is a great conception. The open ceiling, with allegorical
J61 0080  2    and classical figures thrown in masses against the
J61 0080 10    sky: the closed frieze, formally divided into historical
J61 0090  8    scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls, belong
J61 0100  7    in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and
J61 0110  4    his Baroque followers. The descent may be remote, but
J61 0120  2    this is surely the only full-scale example of that
J61 0120 12    vigorous inheritance in the United States.
J61 0130  5       Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme
J61 0140  3    as a whole, in collaboration with the architect Charles
J61 0150  1    U. Walter, at the time when plans were being made to
J61 0150 12    replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present
J61 0160  9    much larger iron structure. After many years and many
J61 0170  6    interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco,
J61 0180  4    and slightly less than half the frieze, beginning with
J61 0190  2    the Liberty group opposite the East door, and ending
J61 0190 11    with William Penn, all but one leg, when a tragic accident
J61 0200 10    ended his career. He left at his death sketches, drawn
J61 0210  8    to scale, for the rest of the circle. These were carried
J61 0220  4    out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini, who began
J61 0230  3    by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania
J61 0240  1    and noting in pencil, in Italian, that he "began at
J61 0240 11    this point".
J61 0250  1       When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six
J61 0260  1    feet of empty frieze were left over. A blank undecorated
J61 0260 11    void, plastered in roughcast, disfigured the wall of
J61 0270  7    the Rotunda until 1951. Then, advised by the Architect
J61 0280  5    of the Capitol, the Joint Committee for the Library,
J61 0290  4    traditionally responsible for the works of art in the
J61 0300  1    building, ordered the space cleared and painted in
J61 0300  9    fresco, to show "the Peace after the Civil War", "the
J61 0310  8    Spanish-American War", and "the Birth of Aviation",
J61 0320  6    to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique
J61 0330  3    and composition. Later the cleaning and restoration
J61 0340  1    were ordered, first of the older part of the frieze,
J61 0340 11    finally of the canopy. What follows is therefore a
J61 0350  8    description of three separate undertakings, the new
J61 0360  4    frescoing of the gap, and the successive essays in
J61 0370  2    conservation, with some discussion of problems that
J61 0370  9    arose in connection with each.
J61 0380  3       For the use of students and future restorers, a
J61 0390  2    full, day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings,
J61 0390 13    complete technical reports on what we found and what
J61 0400  9    we did. These may be consulted in the office of the
J61 0410  6    Architect of the Capitol, or the Library of Congress.
J61 0420  3       The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished
J61 0430  1    length of frieze, a jumble of roughcast and finish
J61 0430 10    coats, all in bad condition. It was decided to strip
J61 0450  8    the whole area down to the bricks, and to replace the
J61 0460  5    rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with
J61 0470  2    the older artists' preparation, with a mortar, one
J61 0470 10    part slaked lime, three parts sand, to be put on in
J61 0480 10    two layers. Cartoons were drawn full size, after sketches
J61 0490  5    had been made to satisfy all the authorities. There
J61 0500  2    was some difficulty here. One had to manage the given
J61 0500 12    subjects, three diverse recent events, so as to make
J61 0510  9    them part of a classical frieze,- that is, a pattern
J61 0520  5    of large figures filling the space, with not much else,
J61 0530  5    against a blank background. Moreover, all three representations
J61 0540  2    must be squeezed comfortably into little more than
J61 0540 10    the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his.
J61 0550  9       When it was all arranged to fit, and not to interrupt
J61 0560  8    the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze, the
J61 0570  5    cartoons were tried in place. The scaffolding, a confusion
J61 0580  2    of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above, was
J61 0580 11    strong and safe, but obscured visibility. Nothing could
J61 0590  7    be seen from the floor, but by moving around the gallery
J61 0600  7    one could get glimpses; and we were able to decide
J61 0610  4    on some amplification of scale. To be sure of matching
J61 0620  1    color as well as form, pieces of cartoon were traced
J61 0620 11    on the roughcast, and large samples painted in fresco,
J61 0630  7    then left two months to dry out to their final key.
J61 0640  6    Later it was gratifying to note that they had set so
J61 0650  3    solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.
J61 0650 14       The scaffold was the length of the space to be painted.
J61 0660 11    What bits of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached
J61 0670  6    at either end seemed in good order, though the roughish
J61 0680  5    sandy surface was thick with dust. Washed, they came
J61 0690  3    out surprisingly clear and bright. It could be seen
J61 0690 12    that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster,
J61 0700 11    one half inch, and that both followed the traditional
J61 0710  7    Italian fresco technique as described by Cennino Cennini
J61 0720  4    in the 14th Century, and current in Italy to this day.
J61 0730  4    That is, they used opaque color throughout, getting
J61 0730 12    solid highlights with active lime white. Painting "a
J61 0740  8    secco" is much in evidence. A brown hatching reinforces
J61 0750  7    and broadens shadows, and much of the background is
J61 0760  6    solidly covered with a dark coat. This brown is sometimes
J61 0770  3    so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint.
J61 0780  1       In our own practice, to have the last "intonaco"
J61 0780  9    plaster coat thick enough to match, and at the same
J61 0790  8    time to avoid fine cracks in drying, we found that
J61 0800  4    it had to be put on in two layers, letting the first
J61 0810  1    set awhile before applying the second. The mortar was
J61 0810 10    three parts sand to two of lime. Some of the lime that
J61 0820 10    is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster
J61 0830  4    repairs was slaked several months for us; but to make
J61 0840  4    it stiffer, of a really putty-like consistency to avoid
J61 0840 14    cracking, we added a little hydrated lime- hard on
J61 0850  9    the hands, but we could see no other disadvantage.
J61 0860  6    I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained
J61 0870  4    longer in condition for painting. As it was, it took
J61 0880  2    the pigment well for six hours, enough for our purpose,
J61 0880 12    and held it firmly in setting. It was obvious that
J61 0890  9    to match Brumidi, white must be mixed with all but
J61 0900  6    the darkest tones. Lime white, hard and brilliant,
J61 0910  1    has a tendency to "jump" away from the other colors
J61 0910 11    in drying, and also by its capacity to set, to preclude
J61 0920 10    the use of ready-made gradations, so useful in decorative
J61 0930  6    work. In older Italian practice, lime, dried and reground
J61 0940  5    "bianco sangiovanni", entered into such prepared shades.
J61 0950  3    For convenience we chose a stronger pigment, unknown
J61 0970  1    to the early Italians or to Brumidi, titanium oxide,
J61 0970 10    reserving the active lime white for highest lights,
J61 0980  7    put on at the end of the day's stint. Other pigments
J61 0990  4    were mostly raw umber, some burnt umber, and a little
J61 1000  3    yellow ochre. This last was probably not in Brumidi's
J61 1000 12    palette, but was needed to take the chill, bluish look
J61 1010 10    off the new work next to the old, where softening effects
J61 1020  1    of time were seen, even after thorough cleaning. The
J61 1030  3    use of "secco" we tried to restrict to covering joints.
J61 1040  2    Experience showed, however, that it is very difficult
J61 1040 10    to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will
J61 1050 10    not dry out spotty and uneven. Later Brumidi and Costaggini
J61 1060  7    will be seen coping with this same problem. We were
J61 1070  5    forced, as they were, to work a good deal of tempera
J61 1080  2    into background and dark areas. We made it by Doerner's
J61 1090  1    recipe, five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to
J61 1090  9    one of lime putty; ground together they made a strong
J61 1100  7    adhesive, which became waterproof in drying.
J61 1110  3       Figure 1 was taken in 1953. The new part is finished.
J61 1120  1    On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group, as it looked
J61 1120 12    after cleaning operations, which had not yet come around
J61 1130  9    to the other end; where, of Costaggini, only some foliage
J61 1140  7    has been washed, at the point where his work stopped.
J61 1150  5    One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was
J61 1160  3    there, left for our century to finish. Costaggini said
J61 1160 12    it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material
J61 1170  9    to fill the circle. Brumidi's son later maintained
J61 1180  5    that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's
J61 1190  5    designs, ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim
J61 1200  3    for his very own. This question might be settled by
J61 1200 13    comparing the measurement of the actual circumference
J61 1210  7    with the dimensions noted, presumably in Brumidi's
J61 1220  5    hand, above the various sections of his long preparatory
J61 1230  4    drawing, which has been kept. Whose ever fault, it
J61 1250  2    is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole
J61 1250 12    frieze with his "histories" and come full circle with
J61 1260  8    the scene of the discovery of California gold. In painting
J61 1270  6    a fresco, the handling of wet mortar compels one always
J61 1280  4    to move from top to bottom and from left to right,
J61 1290  1    not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering.
J61 1290  9    At the very first, then, Brumidi was required, by the
J61 1300  9    classically pyramidal shape of his central group, to
J61 1310  7    fill in the triangular space above the seated girl
J61 1320  3    on Liberty's right, before starting on the allegorical
J61 1330  1    figures themselves. Here he put a small man, whose
J61 1330 10    missing hands might have left his function doubtful,
J61 1340  7    until comparison with the first sketches showed that
J61 1350  4    when the artist came back to the beginning, this was
J61 1360  2    to be the closing figure of the party of "forty-niners",
J61 1360 13    and was to hold a basket. One sees Costaggini's rendering
J61 1370 10    of the same figure more than thirty feet away. The
J61 1380  8    photograph, Figure 1 of the completed frieze, shows
J61 1390  3    how, having been separated from his fellows in useless
J61 1400  2    isolation for eighty years, he has now been given a
J61 1400 12    hand, and by juxtaposition (and the permission of the
J61 1410  8    Committee), given a new job, to represent the witnesses
J61 1420  5    of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903.
J61 1430  2       The startlingly bright effect of the first washings
J61 1430 10    led the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini
J61 1440 11    cycle cleaned and restored to go with them. The fixed
J61 1450  9    wooden scaffold was removed, and, so as to reach all
J61 1460  7    the frieze, one of pipe, on wheels, built up from the
J61 1470  4    floor. Every few days, in the early morning, as the
J61 1470 14    work progressed, twenty men would appear to push it
J61 1480  9    ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed
J61 1490  5    its weight widely on the Rotunda pavement, supported
J61 1500  3    as it is by ancient brick vaulting.
J61 1500 10       On this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty
J61 1510  7    feet from the floor, after a first dusting, we began
J61 1520  6    to wash. A most useful tool for wetting the surface
J61 1530  2    without running down was made from a greenhouse "mist
J61 1530 11    spray" nozzle welded to a hose connection, to be used
J61 1540 10    at low water pressure. A valve in the handle let us
J61 1550  8    cut the pressure still lower. One man sprayed, with
J61 1560  4    a sponge in hand to check excess wetting. A second
J61 1570  1    assistant mopped with two sponges. In parts a repeated
J61 1570 10    sponging was needed, but everywhere we found that water
J61 1580  8    alone was enough to restore the original brightness.
J61 1590  4    No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might
J61 1600  2    bring in unwanted chemical reactions. The painting
J61 1600  9    "a fresco" stood up superbly; a little of the "secco"
J61 1610  9    came off. Necessary retouching was put on at once.
J61 1620  7    Altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate, especially
J61 1630  4    Brumidi's. We were greatly helped by there being no
J61 1640  4    traces of former restoring. Apparently not more than
J61 1650  1    dusting had ever been done, and not much of that. The
J61 1650 12    plaster was sound, the intonaco firmly attached all
J61 1660  6    over, and the pigment solidly incorporated with it
J61 1670  3    in all but a few unimportant places.
J61 1670 10       The greatest source of trouble was rain which had
J61 1680  8    repeatedly flowed from openings above, soaking the
J61 1690  4    surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime, very
J61 1700  2    conspicuous even after cleaning, particularly in the
J61 1700  9    "Landing of Columbus", "Oglethorpe and the Indians",
J61 1710  7    and "Yorktown". Here the Architect, referring to the
J61 1720  7    use of the Capitol as a public building, not a museum,
J61 1730  6    requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect,
J61 1740  2    rather than leaving blank, unsightly patches.
J61 1750  1       These frescos have had no care for eighty years.
J61 1750  9    With naked gas jets below and leaky windows above,
J61 1760  6    enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium, they have
J61 1770  4    survived, in a building long unheated in winter, hot
J61 1780  1    and damp under the iron dome in summer.
