J07 0010  1    The Poynting-Robertson effect (Robertson, 1937; Wyatt
J07 0010  8    and Whipple, 1950), which is a retardation of the orbital
J07 0020  9    motion of particles by the relativistic aberration
J07 0030  5    of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation,
J07 0040  3    causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much
J07 0050  1    shorter than the age of the Earth. The radial velocity
J07 0050 11    varies inversely as the particle size- a 1000-|m-diameter
J07 0060  9    particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun
J07 0070  8    in about 60 million years. Whipple (1955) extends the
J07 0080  4    effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation
J07 0090  1    pressure, which increases both the minimum particle
J07 0090  8    size and the drag. Further, the corpuscular radiation,
J07 0100  5    i.e., the solar-wind protons, must sputter away the
J07 0110  5    surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution
J07 0120  2    in size, with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson
J07 0130  1    effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the
J07 0130 11    gravitational force.
J07 0140  2       The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major
J07 0150  1    axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor
J07 0150 12    axis, with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits
J07 0160  8    as the particles move toward the sun. Also, planetary
J07 0170  6    gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration
J07 0180  4    near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached.
J07 0190  2    At one astronomical unit from the sun (the Earth's
J07 0190 11    distance) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular.
J07 0200  8    If such is the case, the particles within a distance
J07 0210  6    of about **f km of the Earth will have, relative to
J07 0220  4    the Earth, a kinetic energy less than their potential
J07 0230  1    energy and they will be captured into orbits about
J07 0230 10    the Earth. De Jager (1955) has calculated the times
J07 0240  7    required for these particles to reach the atmosphere
J07 0250  5    under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect,
J07 0260  2    which in this case causes the orbits to become more
J07 0260 12    and more eccentric without changing the semi-major
J07 0270  6    axis. This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites
J07 0280  5    around the Earth.
J07 0280  8       Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic
J07 0290  6    material in space because of the radiation effects,
J07 0300  3    there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise,
J07 0310  1    micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary
J07 0310  7    space. There are several possible sources. According
J07 0320  6    to Whipple (1955), cometary debris is sufficient to
J07 0330  5    replenish the material spiraling into the sun, maintaining
J07 0340  3    a fairly steady state. Asteroidal collisions are also
J07 0350  1    thought to contribute material. It is also possible
J07 0350  9    that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth
J07 0360  9    originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon.
J07 0370  4    #5.3 DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX#
J07 0380  1    One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the
J07 0380 10    micrometeorite flux in space. Even in the neighborhood
J07 0390  8    of the Earth, where information has been obtained both
J07 0400  5    directly and indirectly, the derived flux values vary
J07 0410  3    by at least four orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy
J07 0420  1    demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods
J07 0420  8    and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena
J07 0430  8    involved. Beyond a few million kilometers from the
J07 0440  6    Earth, but still in the region of the Earth's orbit,
J07 0450  3    a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable.
J07 0460  1    At greater distances from the sun, the situation is
J07 0460 10    still less certain.
J07 0470  2       There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite
J07 0480  1    environment. Direct information has been obtained from
J07 0480  8    rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors.
J07 0490  7    In addition, the size distribution obtained from visual
J07 0500  5    and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated
J07 0510  3    to the micrometeorite domain. From the brightness of
J07 0520  1    the F component of the solar corona and the brightness
J07 0520 11    of the zodiacal light, an estimate of the particle
J07 0530  7    sizes, concentrations, and spatial distribution can
J07 0540  3    be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane.
J07 0550  2    Another important source of evidence only recently
J07 0550  9    receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric
J07 0560  8    dust for a meteoritic component. The cores of deep-sea
J07 0570  7    sediments and content of collectors in remote regions
J07 0580  4    are valuable in this category. The data provide a measure
J07 0590  2    of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon
J07 0590 11    the Earth.
J07 0600  1       The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment
J07 0600  8    near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors
J07 0610  5    (essentially microphones) and from wire gages; these
J07 0620  6    instruments are installed on rockets, satellites, and
J07 0630  2    space probes. Statistically, the most significant data
J07 0630  9    have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha
J07 0640  9    (Explorer I), 1958 Delta 2 (Sputnik III), and 1959
J07 0650  8    Eta (Vanguard III). These vehicles, with large sensitive
J07 0660  5    areas, have collected data for long enough times to
J07 0670  3    give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure.
J07 0680  1    Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time
J07 0680 10    products contribute some information.
J07 0690  4       The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was
J07 0700  5    **f for particles of mass greater than **f (Dubin,
J07 0710  1    1960); this mass threshold was derived from the detector
J07 0710 10    calibration and an assumed impact velocity of **f.
J07 0720  8    The data show daily and diurnal variations. Ninety
J07 0730  3    per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between
J07 0740  2    midnight and noon, and from day to day the variation
J07 0740 12    of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude. One
J07 0750 10    may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic
J07 0760  5    material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect
J07 0770  3    the Earth's orbit.
J07 0770  6       There have been contradictory reports from 1958
J07 0780  4    Delta 2, and the data quoted here are believed to be
J07 0790  3    the more reliable. On May 15, a very large increase
J07 0790 13    occurred with **f of mass between **f and **f; for
J07 0800 10    the next two days, the impact rate was **f; and for
J07 0810  8    the next nine days, the impact rate was less than **f
J07 0820  5    (Nazarova, 1960). The data for the first day indicate
J07 0830  1    a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles
J07 0830 11    and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite
J07 0840  9    flux.
J07 0840 10       Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact
J07 0850  9    rate of **f for masses larger than **f for about 1000
J07 0860  7    events in a 22-day period (LaGow and Alexander, 1960).
J07 0870  4    The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of
J07 0880  2    4.5. The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal
J07 0880 12    variations. Note that the mass threshold is four times
J07 0890  9    that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as
J07 0900  8    large. If one assumes that the average flux did not
J07 0910  4    change between measurements, a mass-distribution curve
J07 0910 11    is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger
J07 0920  9    than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the
J07 0930  8    radius.
J07 0930  9       Space probes have yielded little information. Pioneer
J07 0940  5    I recorded a decrease in flux with distance from
J07 0950  4    the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours. With
J07 0951  1    detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based
J07 0960  8    on a few counts, the second and third Russian space
J07 0970  7    probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles
J07 0980  5    detected is less than that of larger ones. Being based
J07 0990  3    on so few events, these results are of dubious validity.
J07 1000  1       The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms
J07 1000  8    of the particle parameters is very uncertain. Many
J07 1010  6    workers believe that the response is proportional to
J07 1020  4    the incident momentum of the particles, a relation
J07 1030  1    deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated
J07 1030  7    to meteoritic velocities. However, one must expect
J07 1040  6    that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity
J07 1050  5    impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship.
J07 1060  2    In the United States, most of the sensors are calibrated
J07 1070  1    by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces.
J07 1070  9    The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction
J07 1080  9    of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident
J07 1090  9    momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected
J07 1100  5    material from the sensor. This "ejection" momentum
J07 1110  2    is linearly related to the particle energy. They quote
J07 1120  1    about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus,
J07 1120 12    but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater. There
J07 1130  9    is a difference in the experimental arrangement, in
J07 1140  6    that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to
J07 1150  4    the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are
J07 1160  2    isolated from the skin. The threshold mass is derived
J07 1160 11    from the momentum threshold with the assumption of
J07 1170  7    a mean impact velocity of **f in the U.S. work and
J07 1171  6    **f in the U.S.S.R. work. The threshold mass of about
J07 1190  4    **f corresponds to a 10-|m-diameter sphere of density
J07 1200  2    **f. However, the conversion from mass to size is unreliable,
J07 1210  1    since many photographic meteors give evidence of a
J07 1210  9    fluffy, loosely bound meteorite structure with densities
J07 1220  5    as low as **f. To what extent such low density applies
J07 1230  5    to micrometeorites is unknown. The velocity value used
J07 1240  3    is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction
J07 1250  1    of the dust is orbiting about the Earth, only about
J07 1250 11    one third the above-mentioned average velocity should
J07 1260  4    be used in deriving the mass. Zodiacal light and the
J07 1270  4    gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket,
J07 1280  2    a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before
J07 1280 12    capture is in circular orbits about the sun, as indicated
J07 1290 10    by the trend of the smaller visible meteors. The diurnal
J07 1300  6    variation in the observed flux may be partly due to
J07 1310  6    the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident
J07 1320  2    velocity.
J07 1320  3       The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood
J07 1330  1    of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from
J07 1330 10    radar and visual meteor data. A summary of meteorite
J07 1340  8    data, prepared by Whipple (1958) on the basis of photographic,
J07 1350  7    visual, and radar evidence, is given in Table 5-1.
J07 1360  7    From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude
J07 1370  3    meteorite, the other masses are derived with the assumption
J07 1380  1    of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit
J07 1380 13    increase in magnitude. The radius is calculated from
J07 1390  7    the mass by assuming spheres of density **f except
J07 1400  5    for the smallest particles, which must have a higher
J07 1410  2    mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence
J07 1410 13    of solar-radiation pressure. The flux values are for
J07 1420  9    all particles with masses greater than the given mass
J07 1430  7    and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual
J07 1440  4    meteors. It is assumed that the flux values increase
J07 1450  1    by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude, in accordance with
J07 1450 11    the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range
J07 1460 10    in magnitude is constant. The values agree with the
J07 1470  6    data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta. The figures in the
J07 1480  3    next-to-last column are derived with the assumption
J07 1480 12    of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth; hence, these
J07 1490  9    figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere.
J07 1500  5    The unshielded flux is given in the last column; these
J07 1510  6    figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in
J07 1520  3    interplanetary space near the Earth. Of course, if
J07 1520 11    there is a dust blanket around the Earth, the fluxes
J07 1530 10    in interplanetary space should be less than the figures
J07 1540  7    given here.
J07 1540  9       Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of
J07 1550  8    magnitude greater than some previously used; for example,
J07 1560  4    Jacchia (1948) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a **f,
J07 1570  3    zero-magnitude meteorite. The older scales were based
J07 1570 11    on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency
J07 1580  6    of kinetic energy into light. The mass scale used in
J07 1590  7    Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion
J07 1600  4    of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer
J07 1610  2    to the trail by the meteorite, permitting the calculation
J07 1610 11    of the mass if the velocity is known (Cook and Whipple,
J07 1620 11    1958).
J07 1630  1       A concentration distribution has been derived from
J07 1630  7    radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude
J07 1640  6    (Manning and Eshleman, 1959). Extrapolation of this
J07 1650  4    relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers
J07 1660  1    the range of micrometeorites. The approximate equation
J07 1660  8    is **f, where n is the number of **f with electron
J07 1670  8    line-density greater than or equal to **f, and q is
J07 1680  8    proportional to the mass of the meteorite. Therefore,
J07 1690  2    n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and
J07 1700  2    in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived
J07 1700 11    from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data. At the fifteenth
J07 1710  8    magnitude, **f, and at the twenty-fifth magnitude,
J07 1720  2    **f. These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of
J07 1730  2    magnitude less than the values from the satellite data
J07 1730 11    and the figures in Whipple's table. The extrapolation
J07 1740  7    may be in error for several reasons. The observational
J07 1750  5    data determining the concentration distribution have
J07 1760  3    a range of error which is magnified in the extension
J07 1770  1    into the micrometeorite region. The solar-electromagnetic-
J07 1770  9    and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated
J07 1780  5    Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness
J07 1790  4    as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution
J07 1800  3    and limit sizes to larger than a few microns. Also,
J07 1810  1    it has been suggested that the source of all or part
J07 1810 12    of the dust may not be the same as that for visual
J07 1820  9    or radar meteorites (Best, 1960), and the same distribution
J07 1830  5    would not be expected.
J07 1830  9    #5.4. INDIRECT INDICATIONS OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX#
J07 1840  4    A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic
J07 1850  3    material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of
J07 1860  1    deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions
J07 1860 10    (Pettersson, 1960). Most meteoritic material, by the
J07 1870  6    time it reaches the Earth's surface, has been reduced
J07 1880  5    to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its
J07 1890  3    passage through the atmosphere. For all meteorites,
J07 1890 10    the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent. This
J07 1900  9    is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial
J07 1910  5    dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination
J07 1920  4    of the meteoritic mass influx. Present data indicate
J07 1930  2    an accretion of about **f tons per year over the entire
J07 1930 13    globe, or about **f.
