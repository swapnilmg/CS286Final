G14 0010  1    _@_
G14 0010  2       There were fences in the old days when we were children.
G14 0010 13    Across the front of a yard and down the side, they
G14 0020 11    were iron, either spiked along the top or arched in
G14 0030  7    half circles. Alley fences were made of solid boards
G14 0040  4    higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden
G14 0050  1    glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line
G14 0050 13    against them. Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs
G14 0060  7    and hundred-leaf roses; front fences were covered with
G14 0070  5    Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle. Square
G14 0080  2    corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of
G14 0090  1    cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete
G14 0090 10    in every detail: high-pitched roof, pinnacle, and narrow
G14 0100  7    gable. On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak
G14 0110  8    and shut with a metallic clang.
G14 0120  1       The only extended view possible to anyone less tall
G14 0120 10    than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough
G14 0130  8    of the apple tree. The primary quality of that view
G14 0140  5    seems, now, to have been its quietness, but that cannot
G14 0150  2    at the time have impressed us. What one actually remembers
G14 0160  1    is its greenness. From high in the tree, the whole
G14 0160 11    block lay within range of the eye, but the ground was
G14 0170  9    almost nowhere visible. One looked down on a sea of
G14 0180  6    leaves, a breaking wave of flower. Every path from
G14 0190  1    back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor, and
G14 0190 12    every yard had its fruit trees. In the center of any
G14 0200  8    open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa
G14 0210  4    and sweet-shrub, snowball, rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead.
G14 0220  4    From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse
G14 0230  1    of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's
G14 0230 12    gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on
G14 0240  9    the path beneath her grape-arbor, or the movement of
G14 0250  5    hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments
G14 0260  3    hung there, half-way down the block.
G14 0260 10       That was one epoch: the apple-tree epoch. Another
G14 0270  7    had ended before it began. Time is a queer thing and
G14 0280  6    memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays with memory
G14 0290  3    and memory with time are queerest of all. From maturity
G14 0300  1    one looks back at the succession of years, counts them
G14 0300 11    and makes them many, yet cannot feel length in the
G14 0310  8    number, however large. In a stream that turns a mill-wheel
G14 0320  7    there is a lot of water; the mill-pond is quiet, its
G14 0330  4    surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem
G14 0330 13    to be much water in it. Time in the sum is nothing.
G14 0340 12    And yet- a year to a child is an eternity, and in the
G14 0350  9    memory that phase of one's being- a certain mental
G14 0360  6    landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning
G14 0370  1    and without end. The part of the mind that preserves
G14 0370 11    dates and events may remonstrate, "It could have been
G14 0380  8    like that for only a little while"; but true memory
G14 0390  6    does not count nor add: it holds fast to things that
G14 0400  5    were and they are outside of time.
G14 0400 12       Once, then- for how many years or how few does not
G14 0410 10    matter- my world was bound round by fences, when I
G14 0420  7    was too small to reach the apple tree bough, to twist
G14 0430  3    my knee over it and pull myself up. That world was
G14 0430 14    in scale with my own smallness. I have no picture in
G14 0440 11    my mind of the garden as a whole- that I could not
G14 0450  8    see- but certain aspects of certain corners linger
G14 0460  3    in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums
G14 0470  1    beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and
G14 0470 10    their sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in
G14 0480  9    long grass, to be turned over by a dusty-slippered
G14 0490  6    foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked in the ragged,
G14 0500  4    brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner
G14 0510  1    between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where
G14 0510 11    we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd
G14 0520 10    tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish
G14 0530  4    pleasure in drinking from it.
G14 0530  9       It was mother who planted the verbenas. I think
G14 0540  8    that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener:
G14 0550  4    she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren.
G14 0560  2    My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden
G14 0570  1    her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants
G14 0570 10    like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas
G14 0580  9    in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar; she
G14 0590  7    filled the waste spots of the yard with common things
G14 0600  3    like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed,
G14 0610  1    and the plantain lilies along the west side of the
G14 0610 11    house. These my grandmother left in their places (they
G14 0620  7    are still there, more persistent and longer-lived than
G14 0630  5    the generations of man) and planted others like them,
G14 0640  2    that flourished without careful tending. Three of these
G14 0640 10    only were protected from us by stern commandment: the
G14 0650  9    roses, whose petals might not be collected until they
G14 0660  7    had fallen, to be made into perfume or rose-tea to
G14 0670  5    drink; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would be
G14 0680  2    blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they
G14 0680 12    were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled
G14 0690  7    over them; and the poppies. I have more than once sat
G14 0700  6    cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning
G14 0710  2    and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher
G14 0710 11    than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap,
G14 0720 10    unfolded, and shook out like a banner in the sun its
G14 0730  8    flaming vermilion petals. Other flowers we might gather
G14 0740  4    as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath
G14 0750  1    the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so
G14 0750  9    prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach;
G14 0760  8    snowballs; hollyhock blossoms that, turned upside down,
G14 0780  4    make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little, dark
G14 0790  2    blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.
G14 0790  9       More potent a charm to bring back that time of life
G14 0800 11    than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered
G14 0810  7    facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are
G14 0820  3    of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they
G14 0830  1    were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but
G14 0830 12    by the hand that held them. Flowers, stones, and small
G14 0840  7    creatures, living and dead. Pale yellow snapdragons
G14 0850  3    that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods of
G14 0860  2    the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch;
G14 0860 12    red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs
G14 0870  6    were picked off and eaten for the honey in them; morning-glory
G14 0890  8    buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they
G14 0900  5    burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers from
G14 0910  2    the trumpet vine that made "gloves" on the ends of
G14 0910 12    ten waggling fingers. Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with
G14 0920  7    their sensitive horns, struggling grasshoppers held
G14 0930  4    by their long hind legs and commanded to "spit tobacco,
G14 0940  4    spit". Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking
G14 0950  1    nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand
G14 0950 12    when they had been buried in our graveyard in front
G14 0960  9    of the purple flags. And the cast shell of a locust,
G14 0980  6    straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing, fragile
G14 0990  2    but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit
G14 0990 12    down its back. Every morning early, in the summer,
G14 1000  9    we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could
G14 1010  9    reach for the locust shells, carefully detached their
G14 1020  3    hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled
G14 1030  1    them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high
G14 1030 12    roots of the tulip tree, where no grass grew in the
G14 1040  9    dense shade ... We collected "lucky stones"- all the
G14 1050  5    creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth and round,
G14 1060  3    that we could find in the driveway. When these had
G14 1060 13    been pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking
G14 1070  9    open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much
G14 1080  8    prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors
G14 1090  3    indicated. We showed them to each other and said "Would
G14 1100  1    you have guessed ..."? Squatting on our haunches beside
G14 1100 10    the flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind
G14 1110 11    the high closed gates at the end of the drive: safe
G14 1120  8    from interruption and the observation and possible
G14 1130  3    amusement of the passers-by. Thus shielded, we played
G14 1140  1    many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness;
G14 1140  7    even when the fences became a part of the game- when
G14 1150  9    a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's
G14 1160  5    enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let down her golden
G14 1170  4    hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we
G14 1170 13    paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside.
G14 1180 12       We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still
G14 1190  8    too young for school. In the heat of the summer, the
G14 1200  7    garden solitudes were ours alone; our elders stayed
G14 1210  3    in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch.
G14 1210 14    They never troubled themselves about us while we were
G14 1220  9    playing, because the fence formed such a definite boundary
G14 1230  8    and "Don't go outside the gate" was a command so impossible
G14 1240  8    of misinterpretation. We were not, however, entirely
G14 1250  4    unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street.
G14 1260  1    We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they
G14 1260 11    sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but
G14 1270  9    we could stand on them, when they were latched, rest
G14 1280  4    our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing
G14 1290  1    to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that
G14 1290  9    lay before our eyes.
G14 1300  3       The street that is full now of traffic and parked
G14 1310  1    cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon
G14 1310 12    in the shade of the curbside trees, and silence was
G14 1320  8    a weight, almost palpable, in the air. Every slight
G14 1330  6    sound that rose against that pressure fell away again,
G14 1340  3    crushed beneath it. A hay-wagon moved slowly along
G14 1340 12    the gutter, the top of it swept by the low boughs of
G14 1350 11    the maple trees, and loose straws were left hanging
G14 1360  5    tangled among the leaves. A wheel squeaked on a hub,
G14 1370  4    was still, and squeaked again. If a child watched its
G14 1370 14    progress he whispered, "Hay, hay, load of hay- make
G14 1380  9    a wish and turn away", and then stared rigidly in the
G14 1390  8    opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet
G14 1400  6    returned no more. When the hay wagon had gone, and
G14 1410  3    an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the
G14 1410 12    corner. The horse walked, the reins were slack, the
G14 1420  9    huckster rode with bowed shoulders, his forearms across
G14 1430  5    his knees. Sleepily, as if half-reluctant to break
G14 1440  3    the silence, he lifted his voice: "Rhu-beb-ni-ice fresh
G14 1450  2    rhu-beb today"! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time
G14 1460  1    like the drone of a bumble-bee. No one seemed to hear
G14 1460 13    him, no one heeded. The horse plodded on, and he repeated
G14 1470  8    his call. It became so monotonous as to seem a part
G14 1480  6    of the quietness. After his passage, the street was
G14 1490  2    empty again. The sun moved slant-wise across the sky
G14 1490 12    and down; the trees' shadows circled from street to
G14 1500  8    sidewalk, from sidewalk to lawn. At four-o'clock, or
G14 1510  7    four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy marked the end
G14 1520  4    of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front door,
G14 1530  2    and housewives came down to their steps to pick them
G14 1530 12    up and read what their neighbors had been doing.
G14 1540  7       The streets of any county town were like this on
G14 1550  6    any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were like this
G14 1560  3    fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday. But the fences
G14 1560 12    were still in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we
G14 1570 10    stood on the gate to look over, the sidewalk under
G14 1580  5    our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones
G14 1590  2    with grass between and on both sides. The curb was
G14 1590 12    a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted
G14 1600 10    this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots
G14 1610  7    of trees. Opposite every gate was a hitching post or
G14 1620  3    a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for
G14 1620 14    tying a horse. The street was unpaved and rose steeply
G14 1630 10    toward the center; it was mud in wet weather and dust,
G14 1640  9    ankle-deep, in dry, and could be crossed only at the
G14 1650  6    corner where there were stepping stones. It had a bucolic
G14 1660  3    atmosphere that it has lost long since. The hoofmarks
G14 1660 12    of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or
G14 1670 12    in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod
G14 1680  7    horses. Cows were kept in backyard barns, boys were
G14 1690  3    hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the
G14 1690 14    edge of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and
G14 1700 10    evening, were the boys' coaxing voices, the thud of
G14 1710  6    hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.
