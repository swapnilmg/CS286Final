M04 0010  1       Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one
M04 0010 11    elbow. He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw.
M04 0020  8    "Ekstrohm, Nogol, you guys okay"?
M04 0030  2       "Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured",
M04 0040  1    Nogol said. He didn't say what would cure him; he had
M04 0040 12    been explaining all during the trip what he needed
M04 0050  9    to make him feel like himself. His small black eyes
M04 0060  5    darted inside the olive oval of his face.
M04 0070  1       "Ekstrohm"? Ryan insisted.
M04 0070  4       "Okay".
M04 0075  1       "Well, let's take a ground-level look at the country
M04 0080  9    around here".
M04 0090  1       The facsiport rolled open on the landscape. A range
M04 0090 10    of bluffs hugged the horizon, the color of decaying
M04 0100  8    moss. Above them, the sky was the black of space, or
M04 0110  7    the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis,
M04 0120  2    seen against neon-lit snow. That cold, empty sky was
M04 0130  1    full of fire and light. It seemed almost a magnification
M04 0130 11    of the Galaxy itself, of the Milky Way, blown up by
M04 0140  9    some master photographer.
M04 0150  1       This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor
M04 0150 11    planets, almost like the asteroid belt in the original
M04 0160  9    Solar System. These planets were much bigger, nearly
M04 0170  6    all capable of holding an atmosphere. But to the infuriation
M04 0180  5    of scientists, for no known reason not all of them
M04 0190  2    did. This would be the fifth mapping expedition to
M04 0190 11    the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations. They
M04 0200  8    lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump
M04 0210  5    drive, and no one knew what they were good for, although
M04 0220  2    it was felt that they would probably be good for something
M04 0230  1    if it could only be discovered- much like the continent
M04 0230 11    of Antarctica in ancient history.
M04 0240  4       "How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely"?
M04 0250  4    Ryan asked. He was the captain, so he could ask questions
M04 0260  3    like that.
M04 0260  5       "Some can be lonely in a crowd", Nogol said elaborately.
M04 0270  4    ##
M04 0270  5    "WHAT will we need outside, Ryan"? Ekstrohm asked.
M04 0280  3       "No helmets", the captain answered. "We can breathe
M04 0290  4    out there, all right. It just won't be easy. This old
M04 0300  3    world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago.
M04 0300 14    Nitrogen and oxygen are about it".
M04 0310  6       "Ryan, look over there", Nogol said. "Animals. Ringing
M04 0320  5    the ship. Think they're intelligent, maybe hostile"?
M04 0330  3       "I think they're dead", Ekstrohm interjected quietly.
M04 0340  3    "I get no readings from them at all. Sonic, electronic,
M04 0350  2    galvanic- all blank. According to these needles, they're
M04 0360  1    stone dead".
M04 0360  3       "Ekstrohm, you and I will have a look", Ryan said.
M04 0370  3    "You hold down the fort, Nogol. Take it easy".
M04 0380  1       "Easy", Nogol confirmed. "I heard a story once about
M04 0390  1    a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside
M04 0390 11    and he couldn't get an encephalographic reading on
M04 0400  6    him. Me, I know the mind of an officer works in a strange
M04 0410  8    and unfathomable manner".
M04 0420  1       "I'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials,
M04 0420  9    Nogol, just about a lug like you reading them at all.
M04 0430  9    Remember, when the little hand is straight up that's
M04 0440  5    negative. Positive results start when it goes towards
M04 0450  2    the hand you use to make your mark".
M04 0450 10       "But I'm ambidextrous".
M04 0460  2       Ryan told him what he could do then.
M04 0470  1       Ekstrohm smiled, and followed the captain through
M04 0470  7    the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on
M04 0480  8    his coverall. The strong negative field his suit set
M04 0490  4    up would help to repel bacteria and insects.
M04 0500  1       Actually, the types of infection that could attack
M04 0500  8    a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite, and over the
M04 0510  7    course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses
M04 0520  3    had been found for all basic categories. He wasn't
M04 0530  1    likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped
M04 0530 11    fever.
M04 0540  1       They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface
M04 0540 10    and, with only a glance at the seismological gauge
M04 0550  7    to judge surface resistance, dropped to the ground.
M04 0560  4       It was day, but in the thin atmosphere contrasts
M04 0570  1    were sharp between light and shadow. They walked from
M04 0570 10    midnight to noon, noon to midnight, and came to the
M04 0580 10    beast sprawled on its side.
M04 0590  1       Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot. "Hey, this is pretty
M04 0590 11    close to a wart-hog".
M04 0600  5       "Uh-huh", Ryan admitted. "One of the best matches
M04 0610  3    I've ever found. Well, it has to happen. Statistical
M04 0620  1    average and all. Still, it sometimes gives you a creepy
M04 0620 11    feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some
M04 0630 10    strange world. It makes you wonder if this exploration
M04 0640  6    business isn't all some big joke, and somebody has
M04 0650  3    been everywhere before you even started".
M04 0650  9    ##
M04 0650 10    THE surveyor looked sidewise at the captain. The big
M04 0660  9    man seldom gave out with such thoughts. Ekstrohm cleared
M04 0670  8    his throat. "What shall we do with this one? Dissect
M04 0680  7    it"?
M04 0680  8       Ryan nudged it with his toe, following Ekstrohm's
M04 0690  5    example. "I don't know, Stormy. It sure as hell doesn't
M04 0700  6    look like any dominant intelligent species to me. No
M04 0710  4    hands, for one thing. Of course, that's not definite
M04 0720  1    proof".
M04 0720  2       "No, it isn't", Ekstrohm said.
M04 0720  7       "I think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer
M04 0730 12    picture of the ecological setup around here. In the
M04 0740  6    meantime, we might be thinking on the problem all these
M04 0750  5    dead beasts represent. What killed them"?
M04 0760  1       "It looks like we did, when we made blastdown".
M04 0760 10       "But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures"?
M04 0780  1       "Radiation"? Ekstrohm suggested. "The planet is
M04 0780  7    very low in radiation from mineral deposits, and the
M04 0790  8    atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output.
M04 0800  7    Any little dose of radiation might knock off these
M04 0810  3    critters".
M04 0810  4       "I don't know about that. Maybe it would work the
M04 0820  5    other way. Maybe because they have had virtually no
M04 0830  2    radioactive exposure and don't have any R's stored
M04 0830 10    up, they could take a lot without harm".
M04 0840  7       "Then maybe it was the shockwave we set up. Or maybe
M04 0850  7    it's sheer xenophobia. They curl up and die at the
M04 0860  6    sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship".
M04 0870  1       "Maybe", the captain admitted. "At this stage of
M04 0880  2    the game anything could be possible. But there's one
M04 0880 11    possibility I particularly don't like".
M04 0890  5       "And that is"?
M04 0900  1       "Suppose it was not us that killed these aliens.
M04 0910  5    Suppose it is something right on the planet, native
M04 0920  6    to it. I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too.
M04 0930  4    These critters went real sudden".
M04 0930  9    ##
M04 0930 10    EKSTROHM lay in his bunk and thought, the camp is quiet.
M04 0940 11       The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship. There
M04 0950  8    was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside
M04 0960  5    the ship, except that, faced with a possibility of
M04 0970  4    sleeping on solid ground, they simply had to get out.
M04 0980  1       The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles, ringed
M04 0980 10    with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach
M04 0990  9    of any being.
M04 0990 12       Each man had a bubble to himself, privacy after
M04 1000  9    the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship.
M04 1010  6       Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds
M04 1020  4    of the night on Yancey-6 138. There was a keening of
M04 1030  2    wind, and a cracking of the frozen ground. Insects
M04 1030 11    there were on the world, but they were frozen solid
M04 1040  8    during the night, only to revive and thaw in the morning
M04 1050  6    sun.
M04 1050  7       The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than
M04 1060  3    the acceleration couches on board. Yet he knew the
M04 1070  1    others were sleeping more soundly, now that they had
M04 1070 10    renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed
M04 1080  8    them to send them riding high vacuum.
M04 1090  2       Ekstrohm was not asleep.
M04 1090  6       Now there could be an end to pretending.
M04 1100  4       He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet
M04 1110  3    off the bunk, to the floor. Ekstrohm stood up.
M04 1110 12       There was no longer any need to hide. But what was
M04 1120 11    there to do? What had changed for him?
M04 1130  4       He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night, his
M04 1140  2    eyes closed, pretending to sleep. In privacy he could
M04 1140 11    walk around, leave the light on, read.
M04 1150  7       It was small comfort for insomnia.
M04 1160  1       Ekstrohm never slept. Some doctors had informed
M04 1160  8    him he was mistaken about this. Actually, they said,
M04 1170  8    he did sleep, but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot.
M04 1180  6    Others admitted he was absolutely correct- he never
M04 1200  3    slept. His body processes only slowed down enough for
M04 1210  2    him to dispell fatigue poisons. Occasionally he fell
M04 1210 10    into a waking, gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept.
M04 1220  9       Never at all.
M04 1230  1       Naturally, he couldn't let his shipmates know this.
M04 1230  9    Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service,
M04 1240  8    on physiological if not psychological grounds. He had
M04 1250  7    to hide it.
M04 1250 10    ##
M04 1250 11    OVER the years, he had had buddies in space in whom
M04 1260 10    he thought he could confide. The buddies invariably
M04 1270  4    took advantage of him. Since he couldn't sleep anyway,
M04 1280  3    he might as well stand their watches for them or write
M04 1290  1    their reports. Where the hell did he get off threatening
M04 1290 11    to report any laxness on their part to the captain?
M04 1300  9    A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of
M04 1310  6    that kind if he knew what was good for him.
M04 1320  1       Ekstrohm had to hide his secret.
M04 1320  7       In a camp, instead of shipboard, hiding the secret
M04 1330  5    was easier. But the secret itself was just as hard.
M04 1340  4       Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the
M04 1350  1    ship's library, a book by Bloch, the famous twentieth
M04 1350 10    century expert on sex. He scanned a few lines on the
M04 1360 10    social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century
M04 1370  3    sex murderer, but he couldn't seem to concentrate on
M04 1380  2    the weighty, pontifical, ponderous style.
M04 1380  7       On impulse, he flipped up the heat control on his
M04 1390  9    coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble.
M04 1400  5       Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked
M04 1410  3    up at the unfamiliar constellations, smelling the frozen
M04 1410 11    sterility of the thin air.
M04 1420  5       Behind him, his mates stirred without waking.
M04 1430  2    #II#
M04 1430  3    EKSTROHM was startled in the morning by a banging on
M04 1440  3    the hatch of his bubble. It took him a few seconds
M04 1440 14    to put his thoughts in order, and then he got up from
M04 1450 11    the bunk where he had been resting, sleeplessly.
M04 1460  3       The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him. "Okay,
M04 1470  3    Stormy, this isn't the place for fun and games. What
M04 1480  2    did you do with them"?
M04 1480  7       "Do with what"?
M04 1490  1       "The dead beasties. All the dead animals laying
M04 1490  9    around the ship".
M04 1500  1       "What are you talking about, Ryan? What do you think
M04 1500 11    I did with them"?
M04 1510  4       "I don't know. All I know is that they are gone".
M04 1520  3       "Gone"?
M04 1520  4       Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned
M04 1530  6    the veldt.
M04 1530  8       There was no ring of animal corpses. Nothing. Nothing
M04 1540  4    but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze.
M04 1550  2       "I'll be damned", Ekstrohm said.
M04 1550  7       "You are right now, buddy. ExPe doesn't like anybody
M04 1560  9    mucking up primary evidence".
M04 1570  2       "Where do you get off, Ryan"? Ekstrohm demanded.
M04 1580  2    "Why pick me for your patsy? This has got to be some
M04 1590  1    kind of local phenomenon. Why accuse a shipmate of
M04 1590 10    being behind this"?
M04 1600  1       "Listen, Ekstrohm, I want to give you the benefit
M04 1600 10    of every doubt. But you aren't exactly the model of
M04 1610 10    a surveyor, you know. You've been riding on a pink
M04 1620  7    ticket for six years, you know that".
M04 1630  1       "No", Ekstrohm said, "No, I didn't know that".
M04 1640  1       "You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every
M04 1640 10    jump we've made with you. Now comes this! It fits the
M04 1650 11    pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved
M04 1660  6    in".
M04 1660  7       "What could I do with your lousy dead bodies? What
M04 1670  8    would I want with them"?
M04 1680  1       "All I know is that you were outside the bubbles
M04 1680 11    last night, and you were the only sentient being who
M04 1690  9    came in or out of our alarm web. The tapes show that.
M04 1700  6    Now all the bodies are missing, like they got up and
M04 1710  4    walked away".
M04 1710  6       It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm. No. Suspicion
M04 1720  3    wasn't new to him at all.
M04 1720  9       "Ryan, there are other explanations for the disappearance
M04 1730  8    of the bodies. Look for them, will you? I give you
M04 1740  8    my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of
M04 1750  5    joke, or to deliberately foul up the expedition. Take
M04 1760  2    my word, can't you"?
M04 1760  6       Ryan shook his head. "I don't think I can. There's
M04 1770  5    still such a thing as mental illness. You may not be
M04 1780  4    responsible".
M04 1780  5       Ekstrohm scowled.
M04 1780  7       "Don't try anything violent, Stormy. I outweigh
M04 1790  7    you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man".
M04 1800  7       "I wasn't planning on jumping you. Why do you have
M04 1810  6    to jump me the first time something goes wrong?
