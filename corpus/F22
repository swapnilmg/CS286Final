F22 0010  1       IN Ireland's County Limerick, near the River Shannon,
F22 0020  2    there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen,
F22 0020 13    which means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the
F22 0030  9    residents realize the influence their town has had
F22 0040  7    on American military history, or the deeds of valor
F22 0050  6    that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"!
F22 0060  1    bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper
F22 0060 10    was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers
F22 0070 11    of Cheyennes, Sioux and Apaches, Mexican banditos under
F22 0080  7    Pancho Villa, Japanese in the South Pacific, and Chinese
F22 0090  7    and North Korean Communists in Korea. Garryowen is
F22 0100  5    the battle cry of the 7th U. S. Cavalry Regiment, "The
F22 0110  3    Fighting Seventh".
F22 0110  5       Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for
F22 0120  7    in the modern Army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed
F22 0130  4    to organizational charts and tables. But don't tell
F22 0140  2    that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially
F22 0140 11    in a saloon on Saturday night.
F22 0150  5       Of all the thousands of men who have served in the
F22 0160  4    7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than
F22 0170  1    Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler. Wiry and
F22 0170  8    burr-headed, with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered
F22 0180  9    with medals, Chandler is the epitome of the old-time
F22 0190  8    trooper. The truth is, however, that when Mel Chandler
F22 0200  4    first reported to the regiment the only steed he had
F22 0210  2    ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon
F22 0220  9    he had ever wielded was a pencil.
F22 0230  4       Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service
F22 0240  2    Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the
F22 0240 12    Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he
F22 0250 10    was going to make the Army his career, he wanted to
F22 0260  8    be in the fighting part of it. Though he knew no more
F22 0270  5    about military science and tactics than any other desk
F22 0280  2    officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat
F22 0280 11    forces. The next thing he knew he was reporting for
F22 0290  9    duty as commanding officer of Troop H, 7th Cavalry,
F22 0300  6    in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.
F22 0310  1       Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a
F22 0310 10    tougher spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a
F22 0320 11    new CO brought in from the outside, especially when
F22 0330  5    he's an armchair trooper. Second, if there is ever
F22 0340  5    a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him,
F22 0340 16    it's on maneuvers. In combat, helping your CO make
F22 0350  9    a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed.
F22 0360  6    But in maneuvers, with the top brass watching him all
F22 0370  5    the time, it's easy.
F22 0370  9       Chandler understood this and expected the worst.
F22 0380  6    But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises,
F22 0390  6    beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early. Chandler
F22 0400  3    had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.
F22 0410  1    Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident.
F22 0410  9    He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school
F22 0420 10    and had immediately set about learning his new trade.
F22 0430  7    There was no weapon Early could not take apart and
F22 0440  4    reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and
F22 0450  1    he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full
F22 0450 11    advantage of the Army's correspondence courses. He
F22 0460  4    not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history
F22 0470  2    and literature as well.
F22 0470  6       But for all his erudite confidence, Sergeant Early
F22 0480  4    was right out of the Garryowen mold. He was filled
F22 0490  4    with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved
F22 0500  1    Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new CO know just
F22 0500 11    how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best
F22 0510 12    regiment in the United States Army. He fed the captain
F22 0520  7    bits of history about the troops and the regiment.
F22 0530  3    For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry
F22 0540  1    under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been
F22 0540  9    wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn.
F22 0550  7       It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize
F22 0560  5    that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his
F22 0570  3    shoulders as commander of Troop H. But what made the
F22 0580  1    load lighter was the realization that every officer,
F22 0580  9    non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him
F22 0590  8    carry it, for the good of the troop and the regiment.
F22 0600  4       Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison duty
F22 0610  2    in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was
F22 0610 11    the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding
F22 0620  9    the Imperial Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler
F22 0630  9    was not completely convinced that men would really
F22 0640  6    die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen". The final
F22 0650  3    proof was a small incident.
F22 0650  8       It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party, a big
F22 0660  9    affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for
F22 0670  6    over three-quarters of a century to the strains of
F22 0680  2    an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler
F22 0680 12    looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon
F22 0690 10    him, each beaming above the biggest, greenest shamrock
F22 0700  5    he had ever seen. The faces belonged to Lieutenant
F22 0710  3    Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And
F22 0720  1    when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang
F22 0720 11    the old Irish songs the best.
F22 0730  4       Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle
F22 0740  2    about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago,
F22 0750  1    singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really
F22 0750 10    thought it was strange. For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni
F22 0760  6    Martini, the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message,
F22 0770  6    or Margarito Lopez, the one-man Army on Leyte, was
F22 0780  5    a Garryowen, through and through. It was no coincidence
F22 0800  1    that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders
F22 0810  1    in the regiment.
F22 0810  4       And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen.
F22 0820  1    He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best
F22 0820 14    regiment. One of his innovations was to see to it that
F22 0830 11    every man- cook and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified
F22 0840  8    with every weapon in the troop. Even the mess sergeant,
F22 0850  6    Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer from an airborne
F22 0860  4    division, went out on the range.
F22 0860 10       The troop received a new leader, Lieutenant Robert
F22 0870  6    M. Carroll, fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular
F22 0880  6    Army status. Carroll was sharp and military, but he
F22 0890  5    was up against tough competition for that RA berth,
F22 0900  2    and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set
F22 0900 13    out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as
F22 0910 10    he himself had been sold a short time before.
F22 0920  5       When the Korean war began, on June 25, 1950, the
F22 0930  3    anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting
F22 0930 12    at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had
F22 0940 10    assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War II,
F22 0950  7    the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition.
F22 0960  4    Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers
F22 0970  2    on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another
F22 0970 12    unit, and its vehicles were still those used in the
F22 0980 10    drive across Luzon in World War II.
F22 0990  3       Just a month after the Korean War broke out, the
F22 1000  2    7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat.
F22 1000 12    From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick
F22 1010 10    of the bitterest fighting in Korea.
F22 1020  3       One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler called
F22 1030  2    on that fabled esprit de corps. The regiment was dug
F22 1030 12    in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans
F22 1040 12    were steadily building up a concentration of crack
F22 1050  6    troops on the other side. The troopers knew an attack
F22 1060  4    was coming, but they didn't know when, and they didn't
F22 1070  2    know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12,
F22 1070 13    they were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against
F22 1080 10    Troop H.
F22 1090  1       The enemy had filtered across the river during the
F22 1090 10    night and a full force of 1000 men, armed with Russian
F22 1100  8    machine guns, attacked the position held by Chandler's
F22 1110  4    men. They came in waves. First came the cannon fodder,
F22 1120  3    white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive
F22 1130  1    human battering ram. They were followed by crack North
F22 1130 10    Korean troops, who mounted one charge after another.
F22 1140  7    They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions
F22 1150  5    through sheer weight of numbers, over piles of their
F22 1160  4    own dead.
F22 1160  6       Another force flanked the company and took up a
F22 1170  5    position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw
F22 1180  1    that it was building up strength. He assembled a group
F22 1180 11    of 25 men, composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation,
F22 1190  6    the company clerk, supply men, cooks and drivers, and
F22 1200  6    led them to the hill. One of the more seriously wounded
F22 1210  3    was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking for
F22 1220  2    the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom
F22 1220 11    of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find
F22 1230  8    to the fight.
F22 1230 11       Then Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one
F22 1240 10    step, two, broke into a trot and then into a run. The
F22 1250 10    first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"! burst from
F22 1260  3    his throat. His followers shouted the old battle cry
F22 1270  3    after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.
F22 1280  1       The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top
F22 1280 10    of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen
F22 1290  7    of fire. Chandler, looking to right and left to see
F22 1300  6    how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure
F22 1310  1    bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering
F22 1310  9    the battle cry as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had
F22 1320 10    suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen.
F22 1330  6    He had formed his own task force of three stragglers
F22 1340  4    and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge.
F22 1350  1    Because of this diversionary attack the main group
F22 1350  9    that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge
F22 1360 10    forward again. But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in
F22 1370  5    the head and detonated simultaneously. He went down
F22 1380  3    like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the
F22 1380 15    face of the withering enemy fire.
F22 1400  5       Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, seeking
F22 1410  2    a soft spot. They found it at the junction between
F22 1410 12    Troops H and G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin
F22 1420  9    Goulding saw what was happening. He turned to his platoon.
F22 1430  9    "Okay, men", he said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped
F22 1440  6    to his feet and started forward, "Garryowen"! on his
F22 1450  4    lips, his men following. But the bullets whacked home
F22 1460  3    before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding
F22 1470  1    fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable
F22 1470 10    to believe that their lieutenant, the most popular
F22 1480  4    officer in the regiment, was dead. Then they let out
F22 1490  5    a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming
F22 1500  1    and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy
F22 1500  9    like wild men.
F22 1510  3       That finished the job that Captain Chandler and
F22 1510 11    Lieutenant Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed
F22 1520  7    back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of
F22 1530  8    the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements came up quickly
F22 1540  4    to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's
F22 1550  1    platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and
F22 1550 10    fled across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes
F22 1560  9    were called in to kill them by the hundreds.
F22 1570  7       Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically
F22 1580  5    blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived. Today
F22 1590  2    he is a major- in the Regular Army.
F22 1590 10       So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen
F22 1600  9    that after Korea was over, he took on the job of writing
F22 1610  9    the complete history of the regiment. After years of
F22 1620  4    digging, nights and weekends, he put together the big,
F22 1630  2    profusely illustrated book, Of Garryowen and Glory,
F22 1630  9    which is probably the most complete history of any
F22 1640  9    military unit.
F22 1640 11    ##
F22 1640 12    The battle of the Naktong River is just one example
F22 1650 10    of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting
F22 1660  8    Seventh have paid off. For nearly a century the cry
F22 1670  5    has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment.
F22 1680  2       Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno, who survived
F22 1690  1    the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the
F22 1690 12    enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer
F22 1700  9    whose wife he tried to rape, a lot of men had plenty
F22 1710  9    of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno. Many of
F22 1720  4    his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But when
F22 1730  2    a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges
F22 1730 13    of cowardice made against him, the men who had seen
F22 1740  9    Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had
F22 1750  6    heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured
F22 1760  4    by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.
F22 1770  1    He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.
F22 1770  9       Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn,
F22 1780  7    about which more words have been written than any other
F22 1790  5    battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry first
F22 1800  2    made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years
F22 1800 12    old by then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong
F22 1810  7    Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander
F22 1820  4    and, like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry
F22 1830  5    de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence,
F22 1850  1    Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.
F22 1850 10       During the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant
F22 1860  9    record, was made brigadier general at the age of 23.
F22 1870  8       He finished the war as a major general, commanding
F22 1880  5    a full division, and at 25 was the youngest major general
F22 1890  3    in the history of the U. S. Army.
