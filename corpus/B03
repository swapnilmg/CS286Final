B03 0010  1    #A GOOD MAN DEPARTS GOODBY, MR. SAM#
B03 0010  8    Sam Rayburn was a good man, a good American, and, third,
B03 0020  6    a good Democrat.
B03 0020  9       He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure;
B03 0030  8    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sam, and Mr. Democrat, at one and
B03 0040  7    the same time.
B03 0040 10       The House was his habitat and there he flourished,
B03 0050  7    first as a young representative, then as a forceful
B03 0060  5    committee chairman, and finally in the post for which
B03 0070  1    he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House,
B03 0070 10    and second most powerful man in Washington.
B03 0080  6       Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to
B03 0090  6    label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New Deal,
B03 0100  2    the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was
B03 0110  1    not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that
B03 0110 10    persuasion will miss him as much as any.
B03 0120  7       Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician
B03 0130  4    by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence
B03 0140  1    and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered
B03 0140 11    secrets with him to the grave, for he was never loquacious,
B03 0150 10    and his word, once given, was not subject to retraction.
B03 0160  7    It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected
B03 0170  6    that others keep theirs.
B03 0170 10       The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant
B03 0180  7    or theatrical. His leadership was not for audiences.
B03 0190  5    A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it was not,
B03 0200  3    one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.
B03 0210  1    He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon
B03 0210 13    his chest, his hands gripping the side of a desk, and
B03 0220  9    the political and legislative chatter would subside
B03 0230  4    into silence.
B03 0230  6       He spoke briefly, sensibly, to the point and without
B03 0240  6    oratorical flourishes He made good, plain American
B03 0250  2    common sense and the House usually recognized it and
B03 0250 11    acted upon it.
B03 0260  3       These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn
B03 0270  1    normally did his counseling, persuading and educating
B03 0270  8    long before an issue reached its test on the House
B03 0280  9    floor. He expected Democrats to do their duty when
B03 0290  6    it had been patiently pointed out to them. With his
B03 0300  2    long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing
B03 0300 12    in a political leader.
B03 0310  2       He was, of course, in the House for a very long
B03 0320  1    time. There are only two men remaining in Congress
B03 0320 10    who, with Rayburn, voted for the declaration of war
B03 0330  7    against Germany in 1917. To almost two generations
B03 0340  4    of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence
B03 0350  2    of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House.
B03 0360  1       And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer
B03 0360 11    of it was the end of his desire and ambition. The Senate
B03 0370  9    to him was not the "upper body" and he corrected those
B03 0380  6    who said he served "under" the president. He served
B03 0390  4    "with" him.
B03 0390  6       Sound the roll of those with whom he served and
B03 0400  6    who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson, with whom
B03 0410  3    he began his years in Washington, Warren G. Harding,
B03 0420  1    Calvin Coolidge, FDR, with whom he managed a social
B03 0420 10    revolution. And those still with us, Herbert C. Hoover,
B03 0430  9    Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.
B03 0440  8       He was a fighter for those of his own party. Mr.
B03 0450 10    Truman has only to recall the "hopeless" campaign of
B03 0460  5    1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the
B03 0470  5    first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would
B03 0480  1    have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there.
B03 0480 13    As it was, his absence because of his final illness
B03 0490  9    was a blow to the administration.
B03 0500  1       With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was
B03 0510  1    his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept
B03 0510 10    his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns,
B03 0520  6    but that is part of the game he was born to play.
B03 0530  5       Under any name- Mr. Speaker, Mr. Democrat, Mr. Sam-
B03 0540  4    he was a good man.
B03 0540  9    #UN OFF THE CONGO TRACK#
B03 0550  1    Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve
B03 0550 11    the cause of peace under the United Nations banner
B03 0560  9    have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese
B03 0570  7    troops supposedly their friends.
B03 0580  1       In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported
B03 0580 11    from that jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers
B03 0590  8    dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into
B03 0600  7    the river. The excuse was offered for them that they
B03 0610  5    had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.
B03 0620  1    In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform
B03 0620 10    of the central government might be condoned, had the
B03 0630  7    victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga.
B03 0640  4       Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood
B03 0650  5    or that UN is making any progress whatever toward
B03 0660  2    its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through
B03 0660 12    the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence.
B03 0670  8    Mass rapes, troop mutinies, uncontrolled looting and
B03 0680  4    pillage and reckless military adventures, given no
B03 0690  3    sanction by any political authority, have become almost
B03 0700  1    daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry
B03 0700  9    and anarchy is not the work of Katanga. It happens
B03 0710  8    in the territory of the Leopoldville government, which
B03 0720  3    is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable of governing,
B03 0730  3    and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN
B03 0740  1    support gives it.
B03 0740  4       The main question raised by the incident is how
B03 0750  2    much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the
B03 0750 14    Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that
B03 0760  9    it has no solution in present terms? The probable answer
B03 0770  6    is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise
B03 0780  5    a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations
B03 0790  2    wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are
B03 0790 14    visiting ruin on Central Africa.
B03 0800  5       Right now, they are pushing a resolution which would
B03 0810  5    have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga.
B03 0820  2    That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several
B03 0830  1    points of view. The UN army is too weak, too demoralized
B03 0830 12    for the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping
B03 0840 11    anarchy where it is now garrisoned. Last, it makes
B03 0850  7    no sense to deliver Katanga, the one reasonably solid
B03 0860  3    territory, into the existing chaos.
B03 0860  8       The Congo should have been mandated, because it
B03 0870  7    was not ready for independence. The idea was not even
B03 0880  6    suggested because political expediency prevailed over
B03 0890  2    wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate
B03 0890 13    because it is inconsistent with what is termed political
B03 0900  9    realism. But if any realism and feeling for truth remain
B03 0910  8    in the General Assembly, it is time for men of courage
B03 0920  7    to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some
B03 0930  3    new approach. Otherwise, UN will march blindly on
B03 0930 11    to certain defeat.
B03 0940  3    #FEATHERBED REVERSAL#
B03 0940  5    A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement
B03 0950  5    reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order
B03 0960  5    of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the
B03 0970  3    grounds that it was not based on complete information.
B03 0980  1       The editorial was based on a news association dispatch
B03 0980  9    which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement
B03 0990  7    whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week
B03 1000  6    whether they worked or not and that a reduction in
B03 1010  2    their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our
B03 1010 13    comment was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate
B03 1020  9    form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced
B03 1030  7    since it had entered into such an agreement. The statement
B03 1040  5    was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received
B03 1050  3    some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but
B03 1060  1    that it was difficult to imagine what could balance
B03 1060 10    a job for life.
B03 1070  1       Additional information supplied to us discloses
B03 1070  7    that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers
B03 1080  7    of which it was in need. Also, normal personal attrition
B03 1090  5    would make the job reduction provision more or less
B03 1100  4    academic.
B03 1100  5       The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific
B03 1110  2    was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable
B03 1120  1    to other situations in other industries. The solution
B03 1120  9    reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the
B03 1130  8    railroad than that originally included in a series
B03 1140  5    of union demands.
B03 1150  1    #MEDITATIONS FROM A FALLOUT SHELTER#
B03 1150  6    Time was when the house of delegates of the American
B03 1160  4    Bar association leaned to the common sense side. But
B03 1170  3    the internationalists have taken over the governing
B03 1170 10    body of the bar, and when the lads met in St. Louis,
B03 1180 11    it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote
B03 1190  7    unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less
B03 1200  4    than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and there.
B03 1210  2       It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope
B03 1220  1    for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's
B03 1220 10    wonderful, and "world law", it's wonderful, too, and
B03 1230  7    shouldn't we get an international covenant extending
B03 1240  3    it into space, before the Russians put some claim jumper
B03 1250  4    on the moon?
B03 1250  7       Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev was adding his
B03 1260  4    bit to the march of world law by promising to build
B03 1270  1    a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT,
B03 1270 13    to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs
B03 1280  9    who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin
B03 1290  5    to communism.
B03 1290  7       A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions- roughly
B03 1300  5    some six and a half times bigger than anything the
B03 1310  4    United States has triggered experimentally- would certainly
B03 1320  2    produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev
B03 1320 11    might use it to propel the seminar of the house of
B03 1330 11    delegates from St. Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't
B03 1340  8    even be any beer to drink.
B03 1350  1       While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin
B03 1350 11    contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason
B03 1360  9    by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate
B03 1370  6    coexistence thru suicide.
B03 1370  9       "Fools", he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?
B03 1390  1       The only response we can think of is the humble
B03 1390 10    one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with
B03 1400  5    our shoes in the United Nations, but perhaps the heavy
B03 1410  4    domes in the house of delegates can improve on this
B03 1420  1    feeble effort.
B03 1420  3       Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason
B03 1430  1    was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking
B03 1430 10    of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a
B03 1440  8    gun. The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to
B03 1450  4    Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro rushed
B03 1460  2    to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian
B03 1470  1    foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer
B03 1470 10    of old Ten O'Clock Shadow. The plane was sent back
B03 1480  7    to the United States, for a change, but Castro kept
B03 1490  6    the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable recruit
B03 1500  2    to the revolution.
B03 1500  5       Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed
B03 1510  4    by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara, who edified
B03 1520  3    the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting
B03 1530  1    in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents
B03 1530  9    purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas,
B03 1540  8    Venezuela. The contents were highly embarrassing to
B03 1550  5    American spokesmen, who were on hand to promise Latin
B03 1560  4    Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.
B03 1570  1       Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced
B03 1570 10    by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes,
B03 1580  6    but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer
B03 1590  6    to the effect that, but for its own incompetence in
B03 1600  3    protecting American interests, these things would not
B03 1610  2    happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted
B03 1610 12    Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April,
B03 1620  7    which, we trust, is not symptomatic of the methods
B03 1630  5    to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev.
B03 1640  2       Pass the iron rations, please, and light another
B03 1650  1    candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded
B03 1650 11    to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away.
B03 1660 12    #THE CUSTOMER LOSES AGAIN#
B03 1670  2    The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce
B03 1670 10    commission has ordered a group of railroads not to
B03 1680  9    reduce their freight rates on grain, as they had planned
B03 1690  7    to do this month.
B03 1690 11       The request for lower rates originated with the
B03 1700  6    Southern railway, which has spent a good deal of time
B03 1710  6    and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which
B03 1720  1    it says it can move grain at about half what it costs
B03 1720 13    in the conventional, smaller car. By reducing rates
B03 1730  6    as much as 60 per cent, it and its associated railroads
B03 1740  3    hope to win back some of the business they have lost
B03 1750  2    to truckers and barge lines.
B03 1750  7       The board's action shows what free enterprise is
B03 1760  5    up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.
