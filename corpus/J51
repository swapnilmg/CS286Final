J51 0010  1       The preconditions of sociology have remained largely
J51 0010  8    unexamined by the sociologist. Like primitive numbers
J51 0020  7    in mathematics, the entire axiological framework is
J51 0030  4    taken to rest upon its operational worth. But what
J51 0040  3    is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically
J51 0040 12    reproduces the idea of physical models? Is it not the
J51 0050 10    task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning
J51 0060  6    can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social
J51 0070  4    science? It has become painfully clear that the very
J51 0080  2    attempt to make the language of social research free
J51 0080 11    of values by erecting mathematical and physical models,
J51 0090  6    is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays
J51 0100  6    a premium price for technological manipulation.
J51 0110  1       This push to confine the study of mass behaviour
J51 0110 10    to the measurements of parameters involved in differential
J51 0120  7    equations has led sociology perilously close to the
J51 0130  6    reduction of the word "mass" to mean a small group
J51 0140  5    in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals
J51 0150  1    in such a group can be studied. (Cf. Rapoport, 1959:
J51 0160  1    ch. 11.) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes
J51 0160 12    apparent. The simple pragmatic success of the sociology
J51 0170  8    of small groups needs to be questioned. For if the
J51 0180  7    small group notion involves the implicit claim that
J51 0190  3    the phenomena of sociological investigations are of
J51 0190 10    atomic or subatomic proportions, the philosopher needs
J51 0200  7    to know the extent to which such entities are valid.
J51 0210  6    The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day
J51 0220  5    sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical
J51 0230  3    investigation. (Cf. Brodbeck, 1959: Ch. 12.)
J51 0240  1       A parallel function for philosophy is the study
J51 0240  9    of the relation between perceptions experientially
J51 0250  4    received and conceptions logically formed. Philosophy
J51 0260  3    can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection
J51 0270  1    of socially viable categories. This involves a sifting
J51 0270  9    of the empirical and rational elements entering into
J51 0280  7    each social science statement. Merton's functional
J51 0290  3    sociology may have great practical use in the study
J51 0300  3    of different cultures, yet it is perfectly clear as
J51 0300 12    Nagel (1957:247-83) and Hempel (1959:271-307) indicate,
J51 0310  8    that the concept of function in sociology has been
J51 0320  7    built up from physiological and biological models,
J51 0330  2    in which the notions of teleology, i.e., metaphysical
J51 0340  1    purpose, are central. (Cf. Chapter IX.) Functionalism
J51 0340  8    as a sociological credo is, therefore, not a direct
J51 0350  9    consequence of observations, but rather an indirect
J51 0360  5    consequence of philosophical inference and judgment.
J51 0370  3       The purpose of this sort of philosophical study
J51 0380  1    of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the
J51 0380 11    principles of social science. It is absurd to speak
J51 0390  7    of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology,
J51 0400  3    since the former is a logical, rational discipline,
J51 0410  1    where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical.
J51 0410  8    Such a position entails the negation of philosophy
J51 0420  6    in its Platonic form as something soaring above and
J51 0430  4    embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences.
J51 0440  1    But contrary to Whitehead, philosophy is not a synonym
J51 0440 10    for Plato. The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing
J51 0450  9    house are manifest to any approach that does not descend
J51 0460  7    to pure sensationalism. However, when philosophy attempts
J51 0470  4    to stand above the sciences, to dictate the conditions
J51 0475  2    of empirical research, it becomes formal metaphysics;
J51 0480  5    shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of legends.
J51 0490 11    The notion of philosophy as Queen Bee may fit well
J51 0500  7    with authoritarian modes of political ideology, but
J51 0510  3    it has been noted that the price of such an imperial
J51 0520  1    notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation
J51 0520  9    of the social sciences. (Cf. Wetter, 1952: Pt. II
J51 0530  7    Ch. 5; Horowitz 1957b.)
J51 0540  2       Metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with
J51 0550  1    nature as it was in antiquity. It has surrendered any
J51 0550 11    claims of description in favor of psychological accounts
J51 0560  6    of nothingness, as in Heidegger's system (1929). Science
J51 0570  4    is mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing, in
J51 0580  4    a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense
J51 0590  1    of men. It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics
J51 0590 11    from reality by distinguishing between description
J51 0600  5    and prescription. It is simply revealing the state
J51 0610  5    to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this
J51 0620  2    century.
J51 0620  3       Consider the traditional "four fields" of philosophy:
J51 0630  3    logic, ethics, epistemology and esthetics. It is a
J51 0640  1    commonplace that to the degree these special preserves
J51 0640  9    of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical
J51 0650  6    content and suitable methodological criteria, they
J51 0660  3    move away from philosophy as such. What is left to
J51 0670  2    traditional systems of philosophy is, in effect, only
J51 0670 10    the history of these fields prior to their becoming
J51 0680  8    rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific
J51 0690  5    method. In this situation, philosophy has survived
J51 0700  1    by separating itself from metaphysics, by showing the
J51 0700  9    ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions.
J51 0710  7       The relinquishing by philosophy of pretentious claims
J51 0720  6    to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat
J51 0730  4    problems of meaning and truth which in the past it
J51 0730 14    was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude
J51 0740  9    to knowledge of more humble sorts. In the new situation,
J51 0750  8    philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with
J51 0760  5    the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical
J51 0770  3    sciences, a reservoir of logical relations that can
J51 0770 11    be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and
J51 0780  7    predictive value. Beyond this, philosophy may urge
J51 0790  5    the social sciences forward by asking the type of question
J51 0800  4    that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry,
J51 0810  1    but within its potential domain of relevance. In this
J51 0810 10    connection, it might be noted that the theory of games
J51 0820 10    was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in
J51 0830  6    political science were exploited. Likewise, Kant formulated
J51 0840  3    the nebular hypothesis, according to which the solar
J51 0850  1    system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent
J51 0850 10    gas, nearly a half century before its scientific value
J51 0860  8    was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme du Monde.
J51 0870  6    This does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems
J51 0880  3    it generates, any more so than Riemann's geometry settled
J51 0890  2    the physical status of the space-time continuum. But
J51 0890 11    the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences
J51 0900  8    to work on is itself a monumental task.
J51 0910  4       To those raised on Marcel's Homo Viator and Heidegger's
J51 0920  3    das Nichtige, this may seem a modest role for philosophy.
J51 0930  4    However, modesty and triviality are different qualities.
J51 0940  1    Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences
J51 0940  9    might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which
J51 0950  7    jeers as the sciences evolve. The ceaseless effort
J51 0960  4    to understand and measure the distance mankind has
J51 0970  2    traversed since its primitive anthropological status
J51 0970  8    offers a more durable sort of drama. By clarifying
J51 0980  8    fundamental premises in the social sciences, and defining
J51 0990  5    the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of
J51 1000  2    each new scientific discipline, philosophy can offer
J51 1000  9    the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth
J51 1010  8    in human understanding. Philosophy can prevent the
J51 1020  5    working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content
J51 1030  4    by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis
J51 1040  1    or theory is framed. The dissection of scientific theory,
J51 1040 10    the examination of a theory from the vantage-points
J51 1050  8    of language, epistemology, and ethics, is itself a
J51 1060  6    distinct contribution to knowledge, no less so because
J51 1070  3    of its removal from empirical research.
J51 1070  9       The realm of science, whatever the degree of precision
J51 1080  8    in formulations, covers the range of prediction and
J51 1090  6    explanation. (Cf. Hempel and Oppenheim, 1948:135-75.)
J51 1100  3    Whatever philosophy is conceived to be, its rationalist,
J51 1110  1    logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear
J51 1110  9    that it is something other than science. For some forms
J51 1120  8    of philosophy, this very division between the empirical
J51 1130  5    and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical
J51 1140  2    superiority of the latter. Bergson and Leroy announce
J51 1150  1    that "the secret is the center of a philosophy" and
J51 1150 11    thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher
J51 1160  7    verity. This is simply a confession of intellectual
J51 1170  4    sterility spruced up to look virtuous. For as Merleau-Ponty
J51 1180  4    indicated (1953), it is not the secret which is important,
J51 1190  1    but the removal of secrecy. In this, philosophy and
J51 1190 10    science share a common goal. The hypostatization of
J51 1200  8    the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division
J51 1210  4    of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not
J51 1220  2    be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for
J51 1220 11    this division is but an abstract representation of
J51 1230  8    the social struggle between mysticism and science.
J51 1240  4       The mystification of metaphysical systems does not
J51 1250  3    imply the demise of philosophy, only the close of a
J51 1250 13    philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational
J51 1260  8    and logical. The tenacity with which present metaphysical
J51 1270  6    attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest
J51 1280  5    evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic
J51 1290  3    ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict
J51 1300  1    over the limits and purpose of science, religion and
J51 1300 10    ideology. (Cf. McGlynn: 1958.) Scientific systems,
J51 1310  5    and this includes even the relation of mechanist to
J51 1320  6    relativist physics, are built upon, refined and corrected.
J51 1330  3    Philosophic systems, by the very nature of their completeness,
J51 1340  1    are overthrown by rival systems. In addition to the
J51 1340 10    incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics,
J51 1350  8    they differ in that science is essentially descriptive,
J51 1360  7    while philosophy in its inherited forms, tends to be
J51 1370  5    goal-oriented, teleological and prescriptive. The threadbare
J51 1380  3    notion that belief, unlike behaviour, is not subject
J51 1390  1    to objective analysis, has placed intuitive metaphysics
J51 1390  8    squarely against the sociology of knowledge, since
J51 1400  6    it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge
J51 1410  4    to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than
J51 1420  2    social behaviour.
J51 1420  4       When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy
J51 1430  3    to the sociology of knowledge, or better the role of
J51 1430 13    philosophy in assisting research on the social sources
J51 1440  8    of ideas, one has to become necessarily selective.
J51 1450  5    Certain features we have touched upon: philosophy as
J51 1460  3    a logical, deductive system from which a social science
J51 1470  1    methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of
J51 1470  9    the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences;
J51 1480  7    and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of
J51 1490  6    supposedly disparate sociological investigations.
J51 1500  1       The objection will be raised that the most important
J51 1510  1    role of philosophy in relation to social science has
J51 1510 10    been omitted, namely the status of ultimate value questions
J51 1520  8    and norms operative in the social sciences. Specifically,
J51 1530  5    it will be asked whether the "real" questions people
J51 1540  3    ask are not the "ultimate" questions that social science
J51 1550  3    finds itself impotent in the face of. What then is
J51 1550 13    the status of such questions as: is society the ground
J51 1560 10    of human existence or a means to an individual goal?
J51 1570  8    Do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or
J51 1580  5    are they subject only to the free choice of individuals?
J51 1590  1    Does society really exist as an entity over and above
J51 1590 11    the agglomeration of men? I think it must be said that,
J51 1600 11    contrary to metaphysical insistence, these are questions
J51 1610  5    so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or
J51 1620  4    rational solutions. As Simmel (1908) and Dilthey (1922)
J51 1630  2    indicated, questions of whether the value of life is
J51 1630 11    individual or social are not questions, but assertions
J51 1640  8    of faith made to appear as legitimate questions. Such
J51 1650  6    pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance
J51 1660  4    can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals.
J51 1670  3    Social theory has no more right to expect results from
J51 1680  2    meaningless questions, than physics has the right to
J51 1680 10    expect a theological solution to the wave-particle
J51 1690  7    controversy.
J51 1690  8       It is not that such questions are not asked. It
J51 1700  8    is rather that introducing them into social analysis
J51 1710  4    reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty.
J51 1720  2    An operational approach to sociology can never expect
J51 1720 10    abstract certainty, since it is certainty which every
J51 1730  8    new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes.
J51 1740  5    To raise the added objection that men require certainty
J51 1750  4    on psychological grounds, answers to ultimate questions
J51 1760  1    having an irrational rather than scientific basis,
J51 1760  8    is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself.
J51 1770  7    For what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely
J51 1780  4    that which can be captured for the rational, i.e.,
J51 1790  2    for the scientific determination of what in past ages
J51 1800  1    was considered ultimate and irrational.
J51 1800  6       A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers
J51 1810  5    in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the
J51 1820  3    shortcomings of men, an impatience with partial, tentative
J51 1830  1    solutions. Men have always lived in a tentative world,
J51 1830 10    and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when
J51 1840  7    necessary. Uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition
J51 1850  6    of the quest for new and more precise information about
J51 1860  3    the world. Without such uncertainty we are left with
J51 1870  2    a set of dogmas and myths. The functional interplay
J51 1870 11    of philosophy and science should, as a minimum, guarantee
J51 1880  8    a meaningful option to myth-making.
J51 1890  3       A degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition
J51 1900  1    for the growth of science.
