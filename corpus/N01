N01 0010  1       DAN MORGAN TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD FORGET Ann Turner.
N01 0010 10    He was well rid of her. He certainly didn't want a
N01 0020 11    wife who was fickle as Ann. If he had married her,
N01 0030  8    he'd have been asking for trouble.
N01 0040  1       But all of this was rationalization. Sometimes he
N01 0040  9    woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann,
N01 0050  9    and then could not get back to sleep. His plans and
N01 0060  6    dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long
N01 0070  3    that now he felt as if he had nothing. The easiest
N01 0070 14    thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the
N01 0080 11    country, but there was a stubborn streak in him that
N01 0090  7    wouldn't allow it.
N01 0090 10       The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment
N01 0100  6    that poisoned him was hard work. He found that if he
N01 0110  7    was tired enough at night, he went to sleep simply
N01 0120  2    because he was too exhausted to stay awake. Each day
N01 0120 12    he found himself thinking less often of Ann; each day
N01 0140  9    the hurt was a little duller, a little less poignant.
N01 0150  6       He had plenty of work to do. Because the summer
N01 0160  4    was unusually dry and hot, the spring produced a smaller
N01 0170  2    stream than in ordinary years. The grass in the meadows
N01 0170 12    came fast, now that the warm weather was here. He could
N01 0180 11    not afford to lose a drop of the precious water, so
N01 0190  8    he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches
N01 0200  3    in his meadows.
N01 0200  6       He had no idea how much time Budd would give him.
N01 0210  5    In any case, he had no intention of being caught asleep,
N01 0220  2    so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip
N01 0220 13    and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against
N01 0230 10    the fence. He stopped every few minutes and leaned
N01 0240  6    on his shovel as he studied the horizon, but nothing
N01 0250  3    happened, each day dragging out with monotonous calm.
N01 0260  1       When, in late afternoon on the last day in June,
N01 0260 11    he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk
N01 0270 10    toward the house, he quit work immediately and strode
N01 0280  4    to his rifle. It could be some kind of trick Budd had
N01 0290  3    thought up. No one walked in this country, least of
N01 0290 13    all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the
N01 0300 13    Bar B crew. Morgan watched the two figures for a time,
N01 0310  9    puzzled. When they were closer and he saw that one
N01 0320  6    was a woman, he was more puzzled than ever.
N01 0330  1       He cleaned his shovel, left it against the fence,
N01 0330 10    picked up his Winchester, and started downstream. His
N01 0340  6    visitors had crawled through the south fence and were
N01 0350  6    crossing the meadow, angling toward the house. Now
N01 0360  2    he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly
N01 0360 13    and irregularly, staggering, as if they found it a
N01 0370  8    struggle to remain on their feet.
N01 0380  2       Reaching the house ahead of them, he waited with
N01 0380 11    his Winchester in his hands. They crawled through the
N01 0390  9    north fence and came on toward him, and now he saw
N01 0400  8    that both were young, not more than nineteen or twenty.
N01 0410  3    They were dirty, their clothes were torn, and the girl
N01 0420  2    was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty
N01 0420 13    feet from the front door. She lay there, making no
N01 0430  9    effort to get back on her feet. The boy came on to
N01 0440  7    the porch and sat down, his gaze on Morgan as if half
N01 0450  4    expecting him to shoot and not really caring.
N01 0450 12       Morgan hesitated, thinking that if this was a trick,
N01 0460  9    it was a good one. He didn't think it was possible
N01 0470  6    for this couple to be pretending. The boy licked his
N01 0480  4    dry lips. He asked, "Could we have a drink"?
N01 0490  1       Morgan jerked his head toward the front door. "In
N01 0490 10    the kitchen", he said. Leaning his Winchester against
N01 0500  7    the front of the house, he walked to the girl. "Get
N01 0510  7    up. There's water in the house".
N01 0520  1       She didn't move or say anything. Her eyes were glazed
N01 0520 11    as if she didn't hear or even see him. She had reached
N01 0530 11    a point at which she didn't even care how she looked.
N01 0540  8    Her face was very thin, and burned by the sun until
N01 0550  5    much of the skin was dead and peeling, the new skin
N01 0560  2    under it red and angry.
N01 0560  7       Her blond hair was frowzy, her dress torn in several
N01 0570  4    places, and her shoes were so completely worn out that
N01 0580  2    they were practically no protection. It must have hurt
N01 0580 11    her even to walk, for the sole was completely off her
N01 0590 10    left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding.
N01 0600  7       He picked her up, sliding one hand under her shoulders,
N01 0610  5    the other under her knees, and carried her into the
N01 0620  3    house. She was amazingly light, and so relaxed in his
N01 0620 13    arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious. Any
N01 0630 10    lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had
N01 0640  9    thought up was dispelled. No girl would go this far
N01 0650  5    to fool a man so she could kill him. Besides, she had
N01 0660  2    a sweet face that attracted him.
N01 0660  8       He put her down on the couch, and going into the
N01 0670  6    kitchen, saw that the boy had dropped into a chair
N01 0680  2    beside the table. They looked a good deal alike, Morgan
N01 0680 12    thought. Both had blonde hair and blue eyes, and there
N01 0690 10    was even a faint similarity of features.
N01 0700  3       Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on
N01 0710  3    the shelf, went back into the front room, lifted the
N01 0710 13    girl's head, and held the edge of the dipper to her
N01 0720 11    mouth. She drank greedily, and murmured, "Thank you",
N01 0730  5    as he lowered her head.
N01 0730 10       He stood looking down at her for a moment, wondering
N01 0740 10    what could have reduced her to this condition. He had
N01 0750  7    seen a few nester wagons go through the country, the
N01 0760  4    families almost starving to death, but he had never
N01 0770  1    seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two.
N01 0770 14       The girl dropped off to sleep. Morgan returned to
N01 0780  8    the kitchen, built a fire, and carried in several buckets
N01 0790  6    of water from the spring which he poured into the copper
N01 0800  4    boiler that he had placed on the stove. He brought
N01 0810  1    his Winchester in from the front of the house, then
N01 0810 11    faced the boy.
N01 0820  1       "Who are you and what happened to you"? he asked.
N01 0830  1       "I'm Billy Jones", the boy answered. "That's my
N01 0830  8    wife Sharon. We ran out of money and we haven't eaten
N01 0840 10    for two days".
N01 0850  1       "What are you doing here"?
N01 0850  6       "Are we in Wyoming"?
N01 0860  1       Morgan nodded. "About five miles north of the line".
N01 0870  1       Jones sighed as if relieved. "We've been looking
N01 0870  9    for work, but all the ranchers have turned us down".
N01 0880  9       "You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's
N01 0890  7    half-acre looking for work"? Morgan demanded. "The
N01 0900  4    town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here.
N01 0910  3    Why didn't you go there"?
N01 0910  8       "We didn't want town work", Jones said.
N01 0920  5       "This is a mighty empty country", Morgan said. "There's
N01 0930  4    only one more ranch three miles north of here. You'd
N01 0940  4    have starved to death if you'd missed both places".
N01 0950  1       "Then we're lucky we got here. Could you give us
N01 0950 11    a job, Mr. ..."
N01 0960  4       "Morgan. Dan Morgan".
N01 0960  7       He was silent a moment, thinking he could use a
N01 0970  9    man this time of year, and if the girl could cook,
N01 0980  5    it would give him more time in the meadows, but he
N01 0990  2    knew nothing about the couple. They might kill him
N01 0990 11    in his sleep, thinking there was money in the house.
N01 1000  7    He dismissed the possibility at once. The girl's thin
N01 1010  5    face haunted him. It wasn't the face of a killer. He
N01 1020  3    wasn't so sure about the boy. He hadn't shaved for
N01 1020 13    several weeks, his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic,
N01 1030 10    woebegone expression.
N01 1040  1       There was more to this than Jones had told him.
N01 1040 11    They were running from something. He'd be an idiot
N01 1050  9    to let them stay he thought, but he couldn't send them
N01 1060  8    on, either.
N01 1060 10       "I could use some help", Morgan said finally, "but
N01 1070  8    I can't afford to pay you anything. I guess you'd better
N01 1080  7    go on in the morning".
N01 1090  1       "We'll work for our keep", the boy said eagerly.
N01 1090 10    "I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan, but I
N01 1100 11    used to work on a ranch. Sharon, she's cooked in a
N01 1110  6    restaurant. We'll work hard, Mr. Morgan".
N01 1120  1       "I'll see", Morgan said. "Right now you need a meal
N01 1130  3    and a bath. Your wife's in terrible shape".
N01 1130 11       "I know", Jones said dejectedly.
N01 1140  5       Morgan filled the fire box with wood again, then
N01 1150  5    started supper and set the table. When the meal was
N01 1160  2    ready, he told Jones to wash up, and going into the
N01 1160 13    front room, woke the girl. He said, "I've got some
N01 1170  9    supper ready".
N01 1180  1       She rubbed her eyes and stretched, then sat up,
N01 1180  9    her hands going to her hair. "I'm a mess", she said,
N01 1190  7    and suddenly she was alarmed. "Who are you? How did
N01 1200  5    we get here"?
N01 1200  8       "I'm Dan Morgan. This is the Rafter M. You fell
N01 1210  8    down in front of the house, and I carried you in. I
N01 1220  7    gave you a drink and then you went to sleep".
N01 1230  1       "Oh". She stared at him, her eyes wide as she thought
N01 1240  1    about what he had said; then she murmured: "You're
N01 1240 10    very kind, Mr. Morgan. Do you take in all the strays
N01 1250 10    who come by"?
N01 1260  1       "I don't have many strays coming to my front door",
N01 1260 11    he said. "Think you can walk to the table"?
N01 1270  8       "Of course".
N01 1280  1       She got to her feet, staggered, and almost fell.
N01 1280 10    He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen.
N01 1290 10    She sat down at the table, shaking her head. "I'm sorry,
N01 1300  6    Mr. Morgan. I'm usually a very strong woman, but I'm
N01 1310  6    awfully tired".
N01 1310  8       "And hungry", he said. "Start in. It's not much
N01 1320  8    of a meal, but it's what I eat".
N01 1330  3       "Not much of a meal"? the girl cried. "Mr. Morgan,
N01 1340  2    it's the best-looking food I ever saw".
N01 1340 10       He told himself he had never seen two people eat
N01 1350 10    so much. When they were finally satisfied, Jones said,
N01 1360  5    "I think he's going to give us work".
N01 1370  1       The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed
N01 1380  1    of himself. When he saw the expression in her eyes,
N01 1380 11    he knew he couldn't send them on. She said, "I guess
N01 1390  8    the Lord looks out for fools, drunkards, and innocents".
N01 1400  4       Morgan laughed. "Which are you"?
N01 1410  2       "We're not drunkards", she said. "That's all I'm
N01 1420  3    sure of".
N01 1420  5       She helped him with the dishes, then he brought
N01 1430  3    more water in from the spring before it got dark. He
N01 1430 14    carried the tub from the back of the house where it
N01 1440 11    hung from a nail in the wall. He said: "You'll feel
N01 1450  6    a lot better after you have a bath. Your feet are in
N01 1460  5    bad shape, Mrs. Jones. You'll have to go to town to
N01 1470  3    see the doc".
N01 1470  6       "No, she'll be all right", Jones said quickly. "I
N01 1480  4    mean, we don't have any way to get there and we can't
N01 1490  3    expect you to quit work just to take us to town".
N01 1500  1       "We'll see", Morgan said.
N01 1500  4       "Could you find me a needle and thread"? the girl
N01 1510  5    asked. "My dress needs some work on it".
N01 1520  1       He nodded and, going into the bedroom, brought a
N01 1520 10    needle, thread, and scissors. He said: "I'm going to
N01 1530  9    bed". He nodded at the door in front of him. "That's
N01 1540  9    my spare bedroom. The bed isn't made, but you'll find
N01 1550  6    plenty of blankets there".
N01 1560  1       "You're awfully kind", the girl said. "We'll pay
N01 1560  8    you back if you'll let us. Some way".
N01 1570  6       "It's all right", he said. "I get up early. You'd
N01 1580  6    better sleep".
N01 1580  8       Jones followed him into the front room, closing
N01 1590  7    the door behind him. He said: "If it's all right with
N01 1600  5    you, Mr. Morgan, I'll sleep out here on the couch.
N01 1610  4    We haven't slept together since we started. I just
N01 1620  1    can't take any chances on getting her pregnant, and
N01 1620 10    if we were sleeping together ..."
N01 1630  3       He stopped, embarrassed, and Morgan said, "I understand
N01 1640  3    that, but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave
N01 1650  1    your jobs in the first place".
N01 1650  7       "We got fired", Jones said. "We had to do something".
N01 1660  7       They were a pair of lost, whipped kids, Morgan thought
N01 1670  5    as he went to bed.
