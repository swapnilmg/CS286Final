G36 0010  1       The group, upon the issuance of its first press
G36 0010 10    release on December 21, 1957, designated itself a "Committee
G36 0020  7    of Investigation". In the course of its inquiry, it
G36 0030  8    took testimony from only seven witnesses. It heard
G36 0040  3    Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer, Adolf A. Berle, Jr.,
G36 0050  2    once.
G36 0050  3       Its second press release was on January 15, 1958,
G36 0060  2    and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed.
G36 0060 11    It also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible.
G36 0070  9       On January 18, Ernest Gross conducted a press conference
G36 0080  9    at the U.N. lasting an hour. Here, he openly attacked
G36 0090  8    Bang-Jensen and referred to his "aberrant conduct".
G36 0100  5    This conference was held despite Stavropoulos' assurance
G36 0110  3    to Adolf Berle, who was leaving the same day for Puerto
G36 0120  4    Rico, that nothing would be done until his return on
G36 0130  1    January 22, except that the Secretary General would
G36 0130  9    probably order the list destroyed.
G36 0140  4       On January 24 Paul Bang-Jensen, accompanied by Adolf
G36 0150  3    Berle, was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel Frank
G36 0160  2    Begley, former Police Chief of Farmington, Conn., and
G36 0160 10    now head of U.N. special police.
G36 0170  6       The four, bundled in overcoats, mounted to the wind-swept
G36 0180  6    roof of the U.N.
G36 0180 10       There, Begley lit a fire in a wire basket, and Bang-Jensen
G36 0190 12    dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames. In one
G36 0200  8    of these he said were notes on the identities of the
G36 0210  6    eighty-one refugees.
G36 0210  9       The method of destroying the evidence embarrassed
G36 0220  4    Paul Bang-Jensen. He knew it would be implied that
G36 0230  4    it was done in this way at his insistence. He was right,
G36 0240  2    and Peter Marshall could not help but recall Andrew
G36 0240 11    Cordier's words on the subject, "Well, it seemed as
G36 0250  9    good a place as any to do the job".
G36 0260  5       The Gross group had been formed for the express
G36 0270  1    purpose of advising the Secretary General. Hammarskjold's
G36 0270  8    supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the
G36 0280  9    guise of Ernest Gross is illusion, at best. Gross's
G36 0290  6    being "outside" the U.N. applied only to a physical
G36 0300  6    state, not an objective one. But by the time the papers
G36 0310  4    were finally disposed of, the group had informed the
G36 0320  1    world of its purpose, its recommendations, and its
G36 0320  9    belief that Paul Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind.
G36 0330  8       Shortly the group would issue its report to the
G36 0340  5    Secretary General, recommending Paul Bang-Jensen's
G36 0350  1    dismissal from the United Nations. The contents of
G36 0350  9    this 195-page document would become known to many before
G36 0360 10    it would become known to the man it was written about.
G36 0370  8    ##
G36 0370  9    "Until this Hungarian Committee matter came up, Bang-Jensen
G36 0380  7    was a fine and devoted individual. I had known him
G36 0390  5    for some years, when I was a delegate and before, and
G36 0400  2    this manner had never been his".
G36 0400  8       Ernest A. Gross leaned back in his chair and told
G36 0410  8    Peter Marshall how Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold
G36 0420  3    had, on December 4,1957, called him in as a private
G36 0430  2    lawyer to review Bang-Jensen's conduct "relating to
G36 0430 10    his association with the Special Committee on the problem
G36 0440  9    of Hungary". The result was the "Gross Report", prepared
G36 0450  8    by Gross, as chairman, with the assistance of two U.N.
G36 0460  7    Under Secretaries, Constantin Stavropoulos and Philippe
G36 0470  4    de Seynes.
G36 0470  6       "Yes", Gross went on, "Bang-Jensen was an up-and-coming
G36 0480 10    young man. He had always done well. Never well known,
G36 0490  7    but he had done his work competently ...".
G36 0500  2       Gross had received Marshall courteously and they
G36 0510  1    were discussing the case. "You know", the lawyer said,
G36 0510 10    "it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't
G36 0520 11    answer back".
G36 0530  1       Gross was behind a clean-top desk, only a manila
G36 0530 11    folder before him. Marshall sat in one of the several
G36 0540  9    leather chairs. Outside the office windows, twenty-four
G36 0550  5    stories above Wall Street, a light rain was falling.
G36 0560  3       "Mr. Gross, your report says that 'our function
G36 0570  2    is investigative and advisory and does not in any way
G36 0570 12    derogate from or prejudice Mr. Bang-Jensen's rights
G36 0580  8    as a staff member'. You know, Bang-Jensen characterized
G36 0590  6    your Committee as having prejudged his case".
G36 0600  3       Gross swung his swivel chair. "Well, how could that
G36 0610  4    have been? I don't consider that he was prejudged.
G36 0620  1    We were given a job and we carried it out, and later,
G36 0620 13    his case was taken up by the Disciplinary Committee
G36 0630  6    ...
G36 0630  7       "We have nothing to hide under a bushel. We did
G36 0640  8    our job, Mr. Stavropoulos and Mr. de Seynes and myself,
G36 0650  5    taking evidence from a number of people".
G36 0660  1       "What did you think about his mental state"?
G36 0670  1       "I think our report sums up our finding", Gross
G36 0670  9    answered. "Don't forget, here was a man who had been
G36 0680  9    accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully
G36 0690  5    attempting to present an incorrect report ...
G36 0700  1       "This was not merely alleging errors, but was carried
G36 0700 10    out by day-after-day allegations in memos, written
G36 0710  9    charges of serious consequence ...
G36 0720  2       "This is a distressing thing. Supposing you or I
G36 0730  2    were being accused in this manner, and yet we were
G36 0730 12    doing our level best to carry on our work. No organization
G36 0740  9    can carry on like that.
G36 0750  1       "I've been in government and I can tell some pretty
G36 0750 11    hairy stories about personnel difficulties, so I know
G36 0760  7    what a problem he was".
G36 0770  1       "What I'd like you to comment on is the criticism
G36 0770 11    leveled at your Committee".
G36 0780  4       "What do you mean"?
G36 0790  1       "For instance, regarding the fact that the Gross
G36 0790  9    Committee issued two interim announcements to the press
G36 0800  7    during its investigation. You know Bang-Jensen was
G36 0810  5    told the Committee was 'to convey its views, suggestions
G36 0820  2    and recommendations to the Secretary General'. In his
G36 0830  1    own words, Bang-Jensen 'took it for granted that the
G36 0830 11    Group would report to the Secretary General privately
G36 0840  7    and not in public'. He claimed that the release of
G36 0850  6    the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial to his position'".
G36 0860  4       Gross bristled. For an instant he glared speechless
G36 0870  3    at Marshall. "Listen", he said. "I thought the entire
G36 0880  3    report was going to be confidential from beginning
G36 0880 11    to end. But you know Bang-Jensen launched an active
G36 0890  9    campaign against us in the press. It was getting so
G36 0900  7    that we, the Committee, were being tried. You can find
G36 0910  4    it in the papers".
G36 0910  8       "Well, as a matter of fact, I've looked through
G36 0920  5    back-issue files of New York papers for December, 1957,
G36 0930  3    and haven't found a great deal"-
G36 0930  9       Gross shot another look at Marshall. "It wasn't
G36 0940  8    necessarily all here in New York. Don't forget the
G36 0950  7    foreign press".
G36 0950  9       "Then what about the second interim public announcement?
G36 0960  8    This cited Bang-Jensen's 'aberrant conduct'".
G36 0970  3       "The reason for that report was to settle the matter
G36 0980  7    of the list. As far as I'm concerned, it was a separate
G36 0990  5    matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's
G36 1000  1    conduct. The January fifteen report recommended that
G36 1010  1    Bang-Jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers-
G36 1010 11    in the presence of a U.N. Security Officer".
G36 1020  6       "How about your press conference three days later-
G36 1030  6    what was the reason for that? Bang-Jensen said you
G36 1040  5    told correspondents that you had checked in advance
G36 1050  1    to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous.
G36 1060  1    He claimed you made other slanderous allegations".
G36 1060  8       Gross paused and repeated himself. "The entire object
G36 1070  7    of the press conference was to clarify the problem
G36 1080  6    of the list, since many in the press were querying
G36 1090  2    the U.N. about it. What was the list? I don't know.
G36 1100  1    Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers
G36 1100 10    were that he had in his possession.
G36 1110  6       "It was foolish of him to keep them, whatever they
G36 1120  4    were. He could have been blackmailed, or his family
G36 1130  1    might have been threatened. Of course the matter caught
G36 1130 10    the public's attention. We attempted to conclude this,
G36 1140  7    and did so by having the papers burned.
G36 1150  4       Hammerskjold didn't like the way it was carried
G36 1160  2    out. It was a sort of Go^tterda^mmerung affair. Hammarskjold
G36 1170  1    believes the U.N. is an organization that settles matters
G36 1180  1    in a procedural way ...".
G36 1180  6       Peter Marshall reflected. If Hammarskjold had not
G36 1190  3    wanted the list disposed of in this manner, and if
G36 1200  1    Bang-Jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it?
G36 1200 11       "Mr. Gross, concerning the formation of your Committee,
G36 1210  8    there's the fact that you have been a legal adviser
G36 1220  9    to the U.N. in the past; as I understand it, Mr. Hammarskjold
G36 1230  7    wanted outside advice. Could you comment on that"?
G36 1240  6       "I've served as a counsel for the U.N. for some
G36 1250  6    years, specializing particularly in real estate matters
G36 1260  3    or other problems that the regular U.N. legal staff
G36 1270  2    might not be equipped to handle. Mr. Stavropoulos is
G36 1270 11    the U.N. legal chief and a very good man, but he is
G36 1280 11    not fully versed on some technical points of American
G36 1290  6    law".
G36 1290  7       "What did you think about Bang-Jensen's contention
G36 1300  5    of errors and omissions in the Hungarian report"? Marshall
G36 1310  4    asked.
G36 1310  5       "Those"! Gross answered. "Why, Mick Shann went over
G36 1320  7    and over the report with Alsing Andersen, trying to
G36 1330  4    check them out. Even after the incident between Bang-Jensen
G36 1340  3    and Shann in the Delegates' Lounge ... and this was
G36 1350  2    not the way the Chicago Tribune presented it".
G36 1360  1       Gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper
G36 1360 10    clippings. One was an article on the U.N. by Alice
G36 1370  9    Widener from the Cincinnati Enquirer. The other was
G36 1380  5    by Chesly Manley in the Chicago Daily Tribune.
G36 1390  3       Gross pointed to the Manley story. "I know Ches,
G36 1400  3    he's a friend of mine. He probably didn't mean to write
G36 1410  1    it this way, or maybe he did. There wasn't any 'violent
G36 1410 12    argument' between Bang-Jensen and Shann, as the Tribune
G36 1420  9    puts it. That implies that Shann was on the enemy side.
G36 1430  9    You see what I mean? How it's phrased there- the word
G36 1440  7    'violent'.
G36 1440  8       "The case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann
G36 1450 10    claiming he had found further errors in the report.
G36 1460  5    'I've found errors and I want you to look them over'.
G36 1470  4    So once again Shann had to argue with him about this.
G36 1480  2    But it wasn't a violent discussion. And after all this,
G36 1480 12    Shann went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up".
G36 1490 10       (Shann's own report, Peter Marshall reflected, describes
G36 1500  7    the encounter as "immoderate". Bang-Jensen was in "hysterical
G36 1510  7    condition".)
G36 1520  1       Gross stopped briefly, then went on. "Shann was
G36 1520  9    responsible for the report. He has felt terrible about
G36 1530  9    all this. It was a good report, he did all he could
G36 1540  7    to make it a good report. When I speak of how Shann
G36 1550  4    felt, I know well. Don't forget, I am an old member
G36 1560  1    of the club, a former delegate. I think you are being
G36 1560 12    unfair to take these things up now.
G36 1570  5       "You know, this hits in many areas. It appeals to
G36 1580  3    those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian
G36 1590  1    situation. Don't forget, the U.N. did no more than
G36 1590 10    the United States did ... it takes a great deal of
G36 1600 10    sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact".
G36 1610  7    #CHAPTER 22#
G36 1610  9    FROM THE HOME of his friend, Henrik Kauffmann, in Washington,
G36 1620  8    D.C., Paul Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December
G36 1630  8    9, 1957, to Ernest Gross. It said in part:
G36 1640  5       "... the matters to be considered are obviously
G36 1650  2    of a grave character, and I therefore respectfully
G36 1650 10    request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks
G36 1660  9    in order that I might make adequate preparation".
G36 1670  3       Ernest Gross replied the next day, putting the suspended
G36 1680  4    diplomat's fears to rest. "This reveals some misunderstanding
G36 1690  2    on your part. The group conducting the review is not
G36 1700  2    holding formal hearings. It wished to pursue, in the
G36 1700 11    course of this review, questions arising from the body
G36 1710  7    of material already in its possession ...".
G36 1720  3       It sounded like a fair enough invitation, Peter
G36 1730  2    Marshall reflected, and Bang-Jensen must have thought
G36 1730 10    so too, because on the thirteenth, he met the group
G36 1740  9    of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the U.N. There,
G36 1750  6    Ernest Gross further assured him:
G36 1760  1       "We were requested by the Secretary General, as
G36 1760  9    I understand it, to discuss with you such matters as
G36 1770  9    appear to us to be relevant, and we are not of course
G36 1780  7    either a formal group or a committee in the sense of
G36 1790  5    being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat.
G36 1800  1    The only rules which I think we shall follow will be
G36 1800 12    those of common sense, justice, and fairness".
G36 1810  7       Peter Marshall noted that Bang-Jensen had later
G36 1820  7    referred to his two interviews with the Gross group
G36 1830  4    as "unfortunate experiences", and after his second
G36 1840  1    meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend
G36 1840 10    further hearings without legal counsel. Marshall pondered
G36 1850  6    the reason for this, and pondered too the replacement
G36 1860  5    of one member of the three-man group.
G36 1870  1       J. A. C. Robertson, after serving Gross one week,
G36 1870 10    left for England.
