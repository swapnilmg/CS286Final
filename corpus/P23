P23 0010  1    Under normal circumstances, he had a certain bright-eyed
P23 0010 10    all-American-boy charm, with great appeal for young
P23 0020  6    ladies, old ladies, and dogs. Today, he looked like
P23 0030  5    an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the
P23 0040  2    bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes,
P23 0040 11    hollow cheeks, hollow stomach. Breakfast, he thought.
P23 0050  6    A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better.
P23 0060  5    He looked around his little Eden: bureau, bed, table,
P23 0070  4    chair, two-burner stove. Then he remembered.
P23 0080  1       "You share a refrigerator", Mrs. Kirby had said,
P23 0080  9    and somehow, at midnight, after the long drive from
P23 0090  8    New York in pelting rain, that had sounded reasonable.
P23 0100  5    In the cold light of day, it seemed a lunatic arrangement.
P23 0110  2    Share bath, maybe- but share refrigerator? She had
P23 0120  2    explained it- something about summer people's eating
P23 0120  9    out and not enough space in the units. And where was
P23 0130 10    the thing? He remembered seeing it last night, when
P23 0140  6    he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables.
P23 0150  2    Ah, yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside,
P23 0160  1    on the "curving veranda" between Unit Number Three
P23 0160  9    and Unit Number Four.
P23 0170  2       It was still raining, and Mrs. Kirby's cottages
P23 0180  1    bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore,
P23 0180 11    vivid blue and green and magenta. Charlie downed his
P23 0190  8    orange juice and one of the long, skinny green pills,
P23 0200  6    his spirits as damp as the day.
P23 0210  1       This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week,
P23 0210 10    when his doctor had prescribed it. "Take a full month",
P23 0220  7    the doctor had said. "Lots of sun, lots of rest. The
P23 0230  7    red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound. This is
P23 0240  3    a sleeping capsule. The others will make you a little
P23 0240 13    more comfortable until you get it licked. You young
P23 0250  9    men get to be my age, you won't take flu so lightly".
P23 0260  7       Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment.
P23 0270  4    The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi;
P23 0280  3    but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew,
P23 0290  1    too, that there was no pill to cure it. He had loved
P23 0290 13    and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else, had watched
P23 0300  7    her marry the somebody else, and had caught a bear
P23 0310  5    of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever, which
P23 0320  1    was really piling it on. He had caught, too, like an
P23 0320 12    ailment, a confirmed distrust of women. Once burned-
P23 0330  6    scalded, really, because Vivian had given him every
P23 0340  5    encouragement- forever shy. From now on, his was going
P23 0350  4    to be a man's world: the North Woods, duck blinds at
P23 0360  2    dawning, beer and poker and male secretaries.
P23 0360  9       Meanwhile, he had this miserable cold, and as he
P23 0370  8    leaned against the refrigerator, watching the rain
P23 0380  3    make sandy puddles at his feet, the doctor's prescription
P23 0390  1    for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery. In these
P23 0390 12    damp circumstances, he was an odds-on bet to develop
P23 0400  9    pneumonia.
P23 0400 10       He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby, awesome in a black-and-yellow
P23 0410 12    polka-dotted slicker, bearing down on him. "Three-day
P23 0420  8    blow"! she bellowed triumphantly. He had noticed before
P23 0430  6    that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather
P23 0440  4    as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists. "Fine,
P23 0450  2    day after tomorrow", she added.
P23 0450  7       "I hope so", he said. "I've got this cold. Thought
P23 0460  8    I'd bake it out in the sun".
P23 0470  3       "Ah". She studied him briefly. "You've got a peaked
P23 0480  3    look. Better get in out of the wet".
P23 0480 11       Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat
P23 0490  8    universal, Peony being less than weatherproof. As for
P23 0500  5    its being fine, day after tomorrow, he had the unhappy
P23 0510  3    conviction that it would never be fine again, with
P23 0510 12    Vivian lost to him forever. He could imagine her at
P23 0520 10    this minute, honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name,
P23 0530  7    lounging on golden sands, looking forward to a life
P23 0540  5    of unalloyed bliss. All Charlie could look forward
P23 0550  1    to was a yellow pill at noon, a salami sandwich for
P23 0550 12    lunch, and a lonely old age- if he lived that long.
P23 0560  9       He leafed through the light reading provided by
P23 0570  5    Mrs. Kirby for her guests: four separate adventures
P23 0580  2    of the Bobbsey Twins (At the Seashore, At the Mountains,
P23 0590  1    On the Farm, and In Danger) and several agricultural
P23 0595  1    bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease
P23 0600  9    in cattle, hideously illustrated. He dozed, only to
P23 0610  6    dream of Vivian, and woke, only to crash into the night
P23 0620  5    table, bruising his other shin. He took a yellow pill,
P23 0630  2    only to choke on it, and went for the salami, only
P23 0630 13    to find something alive in the refrigerator- something
P23 0640  6    pink and fuzzy.
P23 0650  1       His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby, in her mania
P23 0650 11    for color, had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow
P23 0660  9    managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in;
P23 0670  5    but on further investigation, the thing proved to be
P23 0680  2    a sweater, of the long-hair variety that sheds onto
P23 0680 12    men's jackets- pale, pale pink and, according to the
P23 0690 10    label, size thirty-four. He thought about it for a
P23 0700  6    minute, could find no reasonable explanation for the
P23 0710  3    presence of a sweater in the refrigerator, got the
P23 0710 12    salami, bread, and a Bermuda onion, and put the whole
P23 0720  9    thing out of his mind.
P23 0730  1    ##
P23 0730  1    Next morning, he found a note in the refrigerator.
P23 0730 10    "Would you mind wrapping your onion"? said this note.
P23 0740  8    "The smell permeates everything"! Everything being
P23 0750  4    the sweater, a lipstick case, and a squirt bottle of
P23 0760  5    Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion. The note paper was pink,
P23 0770  3    too, and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly
P23 0770 12    feminine. Not that he had supposed, considering the
P23 0780  8    evidence, that he was sharing this refrigerator with
P23 0790  5    a member of the Beach Patrol. He scrawled "Sorry" across
P23 0800  3    the bottom of the note and then, against his better
P23 0810  2    judgment, added: "Don't you eat"? He didn't want to
P23 0820  2    encourage anything here; but on the other hand, he
P23 0820 11    didn't want her swiping his salami.
P23 0830  5       "Not onions", came the answer the following day.
P23 0840  3    "Ugh".
P23 0840  4       Must have really smelled up her sweater, he thought,
P23 0850  4    and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen.
P23 0860  1    But then, as he well knew, women are not guided by
P23 0860 12    logic or common sense. Take Vivian. Yes, take Vivian.
P23 0870  9    Somebody had.
P23 0880  1       Now, if this were Vivian next door to him and if,
P23 0880 12    for some obscure female reason, she kept her clothes
P23 0890  7    in the refrigerator, they would not be pink. They would
P23 0900  6    be black or white or horse-blanket plaid, chic and
P23 0910  2    splashy, like Vivian herself. Pink, Vivian once had
P23 0910 10    told him, was for baby girls, and grown-up girls who
P23 0930 10    wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy.
P23 0940  5       "Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator"?
P23 0950  4    he mused aloud.
P23 0950  7    ##
P23 0950  8    Eh"? It was Mrs. Kirby, making her toilsome way along
P23 0960  8    the veranda, laden with a clattery collection of mops,
P23 0970  6    brushes, and pails. "What's that you say"?
P23 0980  3       "Oh, nothing. Just glad the rain's stopped".
P23 0990  1       "Oh, yes. Just look at that sky. Be a scorcher by
P23 0990 12    afternoon".
P23 1000  1       "I hope so. I've got this cold".
P23 1000  8       "So you said". She scrutinized him. "My, you're
P23 1010  8    peaked. You want to watch out that you don't get burned
P23 1020  9    to an ash, first sunny day. I must remember to warn
P23 1030  6    the girl next to you in Larkspur. That pale kind's
P23 1040  2    the worst".
P23 1040  4       That pale kind, Charlie thought. Hardly an inviting
P23 1050  3    description. But then, neither was peaked. He could
P23 1060  1    hear Mrs. Kirby now, warning her pale guest against
P23 1060 10    sunburn. "I spoke to the fellow next door, too", she
P23 1070  9    might say. "He's that peaked kind".
P23 1080  3       Surely there was a better word. Charlie looked in
P23 1090  2    the mirror. Run-down, iron-poor. He looked more closely.
P23 1090 12    Frail, feeble- peaked. Clearly, two damp days with
P23 1100  6    the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good.
P23 1110  6       The sun, blazing hot as prophesied, was far from
P23 1120  3    kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties. When Charlie
P23 1130  1    came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill, the
P23 1130 12    whole establishment (gaudy enough when seen through
P23 1140  6    mist and fog) looked like a floodlit modern painting-
P23 1150  4    great blocks of dizzy color, punctuated at regular
P23 1160  2    intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators.
P23 1170  1    This weekend, he thought, he would look around for
P23 1170 10    some more subdued retreat, with Cape roses, maybe,
P23 1180  6    at the door. He could not imagine a flower's being
P23 1190  4    brave enough to grow beside Peony, Larkspur, and the
P23 1200  2    rest.
P23 1200  3       The sweater was gone from the refrigerator, and
P23 1200 11    in its place was a large plastic bag, full of wet pink
P23 1210 12    clothes. No wonder she was so pale, wearing all those
P23 1220  8    cold clothes.
P23 1220 10       He got a red pill and a beer and then, on impulse,
P23 1230 10    transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the
P23 1240  7    refrigerator and scrawled "Be my guest" on the wrapping.
P23 1250  4    It gave him a good feeling.
P23 1250 10       "M-m-m. Thanks", was her answer the next day. The
P23 1260  8    note was propped against his pill bottles and bore
P23 1270  5    a postscript: "You're not at all well, are you"?
P23 1280  2       "I've got this cold", he wrote. Not that it was
P23 1290  2    any of her business.
P23 1290  6       "It's none of my business", said the next note,
P23 1300  4    "but my aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey
P23 1310  1    in hot water for a cold, and she lived to be ninety-six.
P23 1310 14    I mean, she's still living, and she's ninety-six. Why
P23 1320  9    don't you try that"?
P23 1330  1       "I don't have a lemon". He had to write very small
P23 1340  1    to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.
P23 1340 12       By the next morning, she had turned the paper over.
P23 1350  8    "Gee, neither do I".
P23 1360  1       Charlie grinned. She didn't sound like a pale girl.
P23 1360 10    She sounded a little like a redhead. But then, redheads
P23 1370 10    are often pale.
P23 1380  1       He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental
P23 1380 10    office. "I guess that redhead next to me took your
P23 1390 10    advice. I haven't seen her on the beach".
P23 1400  5       "You won't, if you're looking for a redhead. She's
P23 1410  4    got browny hair".
P23 1410  7       He spent that afternoon on the beach, looking for
P23 1420  6    a pale, browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit.
P23 1430  2    There were pink bathing suits on blondes, and browny-haired
P23 1440  1    girls in red or black or green bathing suits. There
P23 1440 11    were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance
P23 1450  7    of glorified tank suits. Up on a dune, he saw a girl,
P23 1460  7    all by herself, sitting on a camp stool before an easel
P23 1470  3    and absorbed in her painting. He paid little attention
P23 1470 12    to her because she was a redhead and because she was
P23 1480 10    wearing white- one of those bulky, turtle-neck sweaters.
P23 1490  7    On the beach, there were pale girls and not-so-pale
P23 1500  5    girls. And he saw them all as he walked up and down.
P23 1510  1       At two that morning, he was still walking- up and
P23 1510 11    down Peony, up and down the veranda, up and down the
P23 1520 11    silent, moonlit beach. Finally, in desperation, he
P23 1530  5    opened the refrigerator, filched her hand lotion, and
P23 1540  3    left a note. "I've got this sunburn", said the note,
P23 1550  1    "and I used some of your hand lotion. Hope you don't
P23 1550 12    mind".
P23 1560  1       "Of course I don't mind", she answered. "You're
P23 1570  1    having a miserable time, aren't you? Use all the lotion
P23 1570 11    you want, and for goodness' sake, stay in out of the
P23 1580 10    sun for a couple of days".
P23 1590  1       This was a very warm, sympathetic girl, he decided.
P23 1590 10    Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman. Now Vivian,
P23 1600 10    for instance, was not too long on sympathy. She felt,
P23 1610  7    and said, that sympathy only made people feel sorry
P23 1620  3    for themselves; it was a tough world, and you had to
P23 1630  1    be tough to hold your own. He didn't know what was
P23 1630 12    so tough about Vivian's world, slopping around Nassau
P23 1640  6    with what's-his-name. Suppose what's-his-name got a
P23 1650  6    sunburn? Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand
P23 1660  4    lotion. She might peel him, once the worst of the agony
P23 1670  2    was over.
P23 1670  4    ##
P23 1670  5    Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms,
P23 1680  2    waiting for the fire in his back to subside, and used
P23 1680 13    generous quantities of the hand lotion.
P23 1690  6       Correspondence passed back and forth.
P23 1700  3       "How's your sunburn now? The only thing, this lotion
P23 1710  2    has glycerin in it, and that whitens the skin, so if
P23 1710 13    you're so anxious to get a tan, you may not want to
P23 1720 12    use it".
P23 1720 14       "I'm not that anxious, but maybe that's why you're
P23 1730  9    so fair".
P23 1740  1       "That Mrs. Kirby! I'll bet she told you I was puny,
P23 1740 12    too. How's your cold"?
P23 1750  4       "Broiled out. She didn't say you were puny. Are
P23 1760  5    you? What's puny"?
P23 1760  8       "Puny goes with pale and peaked. Do you have anything
P23 1770  9    to read while you're shut up? There are two things
P23 1780  6    here about Surviving in the Wilderness, and a book
P23 1790  4    called 'Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe'; but the picture
P23 1800  2    of Tom Swift is pretty sinister. Also the canoe".
