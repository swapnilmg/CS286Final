M02 0010  1    The expense and time involved are astronomical. However,
M02 0010  9    we sent a third vessel out, a much smaller and faster
M02 0020  8    one than the first two. We have learned much about
M02 0030  5    interstellar drives since a hundred years ago; that
M02 0040  2    is all I can tell you about them.
M02 0040 10       "But the third ship came back several years ago
M02 0050  6    and reported ..."
M02 0050  9       "That it had found a planet on which human beings
M02 0060  9    could live and which was already inhabited by sentient
M02 0070  4    beings"! said Hal, forgetting in his enthusiasm that
M02 0080  2    he had not been asked to speak.
M02 0080  9       Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his
M02 0090  8    pale blue eyes.
M02 0090 11       "How did you know"? he said sharply.
M02 0100  5       "Forgive me, Sandalphon", said Hal. "But it was
M02 0110  6    inevitable! Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time
M02 0120  4    and the World Line that such a planet would be found?
M02 0130  1    I believe it was on page 573"!
M02 0130  8       Macneff smiled and said, "I am glad that your scriptural
M02 0140  8    lessons have left such an impression".
M02 0150  1       How could they not? thought Hal. Besides, they were
M02 0160  2    not the only impressions. I still bear scars on my
M02 0160 12    back where Pornsen, my gapt, whipped me because I had
M02 0170  9    not learned my lessons well enough. He was a good impresser,
M02 0180  8    that Pornsen. Was? Is! As I grew older and was promoted,
M02 0190  6    so was he, always where I was. He was my gapt in the
M02 0200  5    creche. He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college
M02 0210  3    and thought I was getting away from him. He is now
M02 0210 14    my block gapt. He is the one responsible for my getting
M02 0220 10    such low M. R.'s.
M02 0230  2       Swiftly, came the revulsion, the protest. No, not
M02 0240  1    he, for I, and I alone, am responsible for whatever
M02 0240 11    happens to me. If I get a low M. R., I do so because
M02 0250 12    I want it that way or my dark self does. If I die,
M02 0260  8    I die because I willed it so. So, forgive me, Sigmen,
M02 0270  3    for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!
M02 0270  9       "Please pardon me again, Sandalphon", said Hal.
M02 0280  7    "But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner
M02 0290  7    having been on this planet? Perhaps, even, though this
M02 0300  5    is too much to wish, find the Forerunner himself"?
M02 0310  2       "No", said Macneff. "Though that does not mean that
M02 0320  4    there may not be such records there. The expedition
M02 0330  1    was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions
M02 0330 11    and then to return to Earth. I can't tell you now the
M02 0340  9    distance in lightyears or what star this was, though
M02 0350  5    you can see it with the naked eye at night in this
M02 0360  2    hemisphere. If you volunteer, you will be told where
M02 0360 11    you're going after the ship leaves. And it leaves very
M02 0370  9    soon".
M02 0370 10       "You need a linguist"? said Hal.
M02 0380  6       "The ship is huge", said Macneff, "but the number
M02 0390  5    of military men and specialists we are taking limits
M02 0400  2    the linguists to one. We have considered several of
M02 0400 11    your professionals because they were lamechians and
M02 0410  7    above suspicion. Unfortunately ..."
M02 0420  2       Hal waited: Macneff paced some more, frowning. Then,
M02 0430  2    he said, "Unfortunately, only one lamechian linguist
M02 0440  1    exists, and he is too old for this expedition. Therefore
M02 0440 11    ..."
M02 0450  1       "A thousand pardons", said Hal. "But I have just
M02 0450 10    thought of one thing. I am married".
M02 0460  7       "No problem at all", said Macneff. "There will be
M02 0470  6    no women aboard the Gabriel. And, if a man is married,
M02 0480  6    he will automatically be given a divorce".
M02 0490  1       Hal gasped, and he said, "A divorce"?
M02 0490  8       Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said,
M02 0500  6    "You are horrified, of course. But, from our reading
M02 0510  5    of the Western Talmud, we Urielites believe that the
M02 0520  4    Forerunner, knowing this situation would arise, made
M02 0530  1    reference to and provision for divorce. It's inevitable
M02 0530  9    in this case, for the couple will be separated for,
M02 0540  8    at the least, forty years. Naturally, he couched the
M02 0550  4    provision in obscure language. In his great and glorious
M02 0560  3    wisdom, he knew that our enemies the Israelites must
M02 0560 12    not be able to read therein what we planned".
M02 0570  9       "I volunteer", said Hal. "Tell me more, Sandalphon".
M02 0580  7    ##
M02 0580  8    Six months later, Hal Yarrow stood in the observation
M02 0590  7    dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle
M02 0600  7    above him. It was night on this hemisphere, but the
M02 0610  3    light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia, Japan,
M02 0620  2    China, Southeast Asia, India, Siberia. Hal, the linguist,
M02 0630  1    saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of
M02 0630 10    the languages spoken therein. Australia, the Philippine
M02 0640  5    Islands, Japan, and northern China were inhabited by
M02 0650  5    those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American.
M02 0660  2       Southern China, all of southeast Asia, southern
M02 0670  1    India and Ceylon, these states of the Malay Federation
M02 0670 10    spoke Bazaar.
M02 0680  1       Siberia spoke Icelandic.
M02 0680  4       His mind turned the globe swiftly for him, and he
M02 0690  6    visualized Africa, which used Swahili south of the
M02 0700  3    Sahara Sea. All around the Mediterranean Sea, Asia
M02 0700 11    Minor, northern India, and Tibet, Hebrew was the native
M02 0710  9    tongue. In southern Europe, between the Israeli Republics
M02 0720  7    and the Icelandic-speaking peoples of northern Europe,
M02 0730  5    was a thin but long stretch of territory called March.
M02 0740  3    This was no man's land, disputed by the Haijac Union
M02 0750  2    and the Israeli Republic, a potential source of war
M02 0750 11    for the last two hundred years. Neither nation would
M02 0760  9    give up their claim on it, yet neither wished to make
M02 0770  8    any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War.
M02 0780  3    So, for all practical purposes, it was an independent
M02 0790  1    nation and by now had its own organized government
M02 0790 10    (unrecognized outside its own borders). Its citizens
M02 0800  7    spoke all of the world's surviving tongues, plus a
M02 0810  4    new one called Lingo, a pidgin whose vocabulary was
M02 0820  2    derived from the other six and whose syntax was so
M02 0820 12    simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper.
M02 0830  9       Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth: Iceland,
M02 0840  6    Greenland, the Caribbean Islands, and the eastern half
M02 0850  5    of South America. Here the peoples spoke the tongue
M02 0860  1    of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump
M02 0860 10    on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling
M02 0870  5    North America and the western half of South America
M02 0880  5    after the Apocalyptic War.
M02 0880  9       Then there was North America, where American was
M02 0890  8    the native speech of all except the twenty descendants
M02 0900  5    of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve.
M02 0910  3       Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into
M02 0920  3    the night zone, Sigmen City would blaze out into space.
M02 0930  1    And, somewhere in that enormous light, was his apartment.
M02 0930 10    But Mary would soon no longer be living there, for
M02 0940  9    she would be notified in a few days that her husband
M02 0950  6    had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti.
M02 0960  2    She would weep in private, he was sure, for she loved
M02 0960 13    him in her frigid way, though in public she would be
M02 0970 11    dry-eyed. Her friends and professional associates would
M02 0980  5    sympathize with her, not because she had lost a beloved
M02 0990  5    husband, but because she had been married to a man
M02 1000  1    who thought unrealistically. If Hal Yarrow had been
M02 1000  9    killed in a crash, he must have wanted it that way.
M02 1010  9    There was no such thing as an "accident". Somehow,
M02 1020  3    all the other passengers (also supposed to have died
M02 1030  3    in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance
M02 1040  1    of the personnel of the Gabriel) had simultaneously
M02 1040  9    "agreed" to die. And, therefore, being in disgrace,
M02 1050  8    they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to
M02 1060  6    the winds in public ceremony. No, the fish could eat
M02 1070  3    their bodies for all the Sturch cared.
M02 1070 10       Hal felt sorry for Mary; he had a time keeping the
M02 1080 10    tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the
M02 1090  8    crowd in the observation dome.
M02 1090 13       Yet, he told himself, this was the best way. He
M02 1100 10    and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each
M02 1110  8    other; their mutual torture would be over. Mary was
M02 1120  4    free to marry again, not knowing that the Sturch had
M02 1130  1    secretly given her a divorce, thinking that death had
M02 1130 10    dissolved her marriage. She would have a year in which
M02 1140  9    to make up her mind, to choose a mate from a list selected
M02 1150  7    by her gapt. Perhaps, the psychological barriers that
M02 1160  3    had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would
M02 1170  1    no longer be present. Perhaps. Hal doubted if this
M02 1170 10    happy event would occur. Mary was as frozen below the
M02 1180  9    navel as he. No matter who the candidate for marriage
M02 1190  5    selected by the gapt ...
M02 1190 10       The gapt. Pornsen. He would no longer have to see
M02 1200 10    that fat face, hear that whining voice ...
M02 1210  5       "Hal Yarrow"! said the whining voice.
M02 1220  2       And, slowly, feeling himself icy yet burning, Hal
M02 1220 10    turned.
M02 1230  1       There was the squat loose-jowled man, smiling lopsidedly
M02 1240  1    up at him.
M02 1240  4       "My beloved ward, my perennial gadfly", said the
M02 1250  1    whining voice. "I had no idea that you, too, would
M02 1250 11    be on this glorious voyage. But I might have known!
M02 1260  7    We seem to be bound by love; Sigmen himself must have
M02 1270  5    foreseen it. Love to you, my ward".
M02 1280  1       "Sigmen love you, too, my guardian", said Hal, choking.
M02 1280 10    "How wonderful to see your cherished self. I had thought
M02 1290 10    we would never again speak to each other".
M02 1300  6    #5#
M02 1300  7    THE Gabriel pointed towards her destination and, under
M02 1310  6    one-gee acceleration, began to build up towards her
M02 1320  4    ultimate velocity, 99.1 percent of the speed of light.
M02 1330  1    Meanwhile, all the personnel except those few needed
M02 1330  9    to carry out the performance of the ship, went into
M02 1340  8    the suspensor. Here they would lie in suspended animation
M02 1350  5    for many years. Some time later, after a check had
M02 1360  4    been made of all automatic equipment, the crew would
M02 1360 13    join the others. They would sleep while the Gabriel's
M02 1370  9    drive would increase the acceleration to a point which
M02 1380  7    the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have
M02 1390  4    endured. Upon reaching the desired speed, the automatic
M02 1400  2    equipment would cut off the drive, and the silent but
M02 1400 12    not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which
M02 1410  8    was its journey's end.
M02 1420  1       Many years later, the photon-counting apparatus
M02 1420  8    in the nose of the ship would determine that the star
M02 1430  8    was close enough to actuate deceleration. Again, a
M02 1440  3    force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would
M02 1450  2    be applied. Then, after slowing the vessel considerably,
M02 1450 10    the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration. And
M02 1460  9    the crew would be automatically brought out of their
M02 1470  5    suspended animation. These members would then unthaw
M02 1480  3    the rest of the personnel. And, in the half-year left
M02 1490  1    before reaching their destination, the men would carry
M02 1490  9    out whatever preparations were needed.
M02 1500  4       Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor
M02 1510  4    and among the first to come out. He had to study the
M02 1520  2    recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen,
M02 1520 12    Siddo. And, from the first, he faced a difficult task.
M02 1530 10    The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded
M02 1540  6    in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal
M02 1550  5    number of American words. The description of the Siddo
M02 1560  3    syntax was very restricted. And, as Hal found out,
M02 1560 12    obviously mistaken in many cases.
M02 1580  1       This discovery caused Hal anxiety. His duty was
M02 1590  4    to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel
M02 1600  1    of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen. Yet, if he used
M02 1600 12    all of the little means at his disposal, he would be
M02 1610  9    instructing his students wrongly. Moreover, even getting
M02 1620  5    this across would be difficult.
M02 1630  1       For one thing, the organs of speech of the Ozagen
M02 1630 11    natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's; the sounds
M02 1640  6    made by these organs were, therefore, dissimilar. It
M02 1650  4    was true that they could be approximated, but would
M02 1660  3    the Ozagenians understand these approximations?
M02 1660  8       Another obstacle was the grammatical construction
M02 1670  6    of Siddo. Consider the tense system. Instead of inflecting
M02 1680  7    a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate
M02 1690  4    the past or future, Siddo used an entirely different
M02 1700  1    word. Thus, the masculine animate infinitive
M02 1700  7    dabhumaksanigalu'ahai,
M02 1710  1    meaning to live, was, in the perfect tense, ksu'u'peli'afo,
M02 1720  1    and, in the future, mai'teipa. The same use of an entirely
M02 1730  3    different word applied for all the other tenses. Plus
M02 1730 12    the fact that Siddo not only had the normal (to Earthmen)
M02 1740 11    three genders of masculine, feminine, and neuter, but
M02 1750  7    the two extra of inanimate and spiritual. Fortunately,
M02 1760  3    gender was inflected, though the expression of it would
M02 1770  4    be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo. The system
M02 1780  1    of indicating gender varied according to tense.
M02 1780  8       All the other parts of speech: nouns, pronouns,
M02 1790  6    adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions operated under
M02 1800  3    the same system as the verbs.
