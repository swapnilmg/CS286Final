A19 0010  1       The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday
A19 0010  8    it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by
A19 0020  9    10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective
A19 0030  6    at 12.01 A.M. next Saturday. The current monthly payroll
A19 0040  4    comes to about $15,000,000.
A19 0040  8       Howard E. Simpson, the railroad's president, said,
A19 0050  6    "A drastic decline in freight loading due principally
A19 0060  5    to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods
A19 0070  4    has necessitated this regrettable action".
A19 0070  9       The reduction in expenses will affect employees
A19 0080  7    in the thirteen states in which the B. + O. operates.
A19 0090  7    #SALARY CUT AND LAY-OFFS#
A19 0090 12    It will be accomplished in two ways:
A19 0100  7    _1._
A19 0100  8       A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of
A19 0110  6    all officers, supervisors and other employees not belonging
A19 0120  3    to unions. There are about 3,325 officers and employees
A19 0130  1    in this class.
A19 0130  4    _2._
A19 0130  5       Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring
A19 0140  2    about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.
A19 0140 13       Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual
A19 0150  9    union members under contract, it must accomplish its
A19 0160  7    payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough,
A19 0170  6    a B.+O. spokesman said.
A19 0170 10       Those union members kept on their jobs, therefore,
A19 0180  8    will not take a cut in their wages.
A19 0190  2       The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot
A19 0200  1    be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out
A19 0200 11    in each area depending on what men are most needed
A19 0210  7    on the job.
A19 0220  1       A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol
A19 0220 13    last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and
A19 0230  9    Mount streets.
A19 0230 11       The victim, Norman B. Wiley, 38, of the 900 block
A19 0240 10    North Charles street, was treated for cuts at Franklin
A19 0250  7    Square Hospital after the robbery.
A19 0260  1       The driver told police he followed as the Negro
A19 0260 10    man got out of the cab with his money. The victim was
A19 0270 11    beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit.
A19 0280  5       He said the assailant, who was armed with a .45-caliber
A19 0290  5    automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue
A19 0300  1    and Gold street.
A19 0300  4       In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41, proprietor
A19 0310  2    of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told
A19 0310 13    police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole
A19 0320 10    $150 from the cash register after choking and beating
A19 0330  6    him.
A19 0340  1       A baby was burned to death and two other children
A19 0340 11    were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged
A19 0350  9    their one-room Anne Arundel county home.
A19 0360  3       The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1, was pronounced
A19 0370  3    dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in
A19 0380  2    Annapolis.
A19 0380  3       His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and John
A19 0390  2    Raymond, Jr. 22 months, were admitted to the hospital.
A19 0390 11    The girl was in critical condition with burns over
A19 0400  9    90 per cent of her body.
A19 0410  1    #BOY IN FAIR CONDITION#
A19 0410  5    The boy received second-degree burns of the face, neck
A19 0420  4    and back. His condition was reported to be fair.
A19 0430  1       Police said the children's mother, Mrs. Eleanor
A19 0430  8    Somerville, was visiting next door when the fire occurred.
A19 0440  9       The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south
A19 0450  8    of Severna Park, at Jones Station, police said.
A19 0470  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7_
A19 0470  4       - The Anne Arundel county school superintendent
A19 0480  1    has asked that the Board of Education return to the
A19 0480 11    practice of recording its proceedings mechanically
A19 0490  6    so that there will be no more question about who said
A19 0500  5    what.
A19 0500  6       The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after
A19 0510  5    he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams, Jr., a board member
A19 0520  4    and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued
A19 0530  1    for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.
A19 0530  9       The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said
A19 0540  8    at a previous session and how his remarks appeared
A19 0550  6    in the minutes presented at the following meeting.
A19 0560  2    #CITES DISCREPANCIES#
A19 0560  4    Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about
A19 0570  5    nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr.
A19 0580  3    Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up
A19 0580 11    for the board's approval.
A19 0590  4       "I hate to have these things come up again and again",
A19 0600  5    Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion. "These
A19 0610  2    are the board's minutes. I'll write what you tell me
A19 0620  2    to".
A19 0620  3       For a number of years the board used a machine to
A19 0630  1    keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice
A19 0630  9    about two years ago.
A19 0640  1       It was about that time, a board member said later,
A19 0640 11    that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen, Jr., State superintendent
A19 0650  3    of schools, told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other
A19 0660  8    education officials that he would not talk to them
A19 0670  5    with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
A19 0680  1       The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary
A19 0680  8    Commission, the Planning and Zoning Board and other
A19 0690  8    county official bodies use recording machines for all
A19 0700  6    public business in order to prevent law suits and other
A19 0710  4    misunderstandings about what actually happened at their
A19 0720  1    meetings.
A19 0720  2       Dr. Jenkins notes, however, that most of the school
A19 0730  2    boards in the State do not do so.
A19 0740  1       State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli (D., First Baltimore)
A19 0750  1    had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the
A19 0750 11    200 block of West Pratt street.
A19 0760  5       He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal
A19 0770  4    ambulance.
A19 0770  5       Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed
A19 0780  3    on the right side. His condition was said to be, "fair".
A19 0790  2       Police said he became ill while parked in front
A19 0790 11    of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street.
A19 0800  9    #BARBER SUMMONED#
A19 0800 11    He called Vincent L. Piraro, proprietor of the shop,
A19 0810  8    who summoned police and an ambulance.
A19 0830  1       The vice president of the City Council complained
A19 0830  9    yesterday that there are "deficiencies" in the city's
A19 0840  8    snow clearing program which should be corrected as
A19 0850  6    soon as possible.
A19 0850  9       Councilman William D. Schaefer (D., Fifth) said
A19 0860  6    in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting
A19 0870  5    crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should
A19 0880  3    be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
A19 0880 14    #WERNER CRITICIZED#
A19 0890  2    Conceding that several cities to the north were in
A19 0900  2    worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr.
A19 0900 11    Schaefer listed several improvements he said should
A19 0910  7    be made in the snow plan here.
A19 0920  1       He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly
A19 0920 12    in December. Equipment should be in operation "almost
A19 0930  7    immediately after the first snowfall", Mr. Schaefer
A19 0940  5    said.
A19 0940  6       The Councilman, who is the Administration floor
A19 0950  6    leader, also criticized Bernard L. Werner, public works
A19 0960  4    director, for "halting snow operations" on Tuesday
A19 0970  2    night after the Sunday storm.
A19 0970  7    #SENT HOME FOR REST#
A19 0970 11    Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued
A19 0980  7    through the week. What he did, Mr. Werner said, was
A19 0990  8    let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some
A19 1000  4    rest. Work resumed Wednesday, he said.
A19 1010  1       Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency
A19 1010  8    route plan, under which parking is banned on key streets
A19 1020  9    and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on
A19 1030  7    them, should be "strictly enforced".
A19 1040  1       Admitting that main streets and the central business
A19 1040  9    district should have priority, the Councilman said
A19 1050  7    it is also essential that small shopping areas "not
A19 1060  5    be overlooked ... if our small merchants are to survive".
A19 1070  3       Recounting personal observations of clearance work,
A19 1080  2    the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of
A19 1080 10    equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and
A19 1090  8    urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave
A19 1100  7    behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
A19 1120  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7 (SPECIAL)_
A19 1120  5       - The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney
A19 1130  4    and his wife, who were murdered early today in their
A19 1140  2    Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring
A19 1140 11    Grove State Hospital for detention.
A19 1150  4       The victims were H. Malone Dresbach, 47, and his
A19 1160  4    wife, Shirley, 46. Each had been shot in the back several
A19 1170  2    times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle, according
A19 1170 10    to Capt. Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.
A19 1180  8       Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding
A19 1190  7    the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile
A19 1200  7    accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail. The
A19 1210  4    Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing
A19 1220  3    in Juvenile Court.
A19 1220  6       #YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE#
A19 1230  1    Soon after 10 A.M., when police reached the 1-1/2-story
A19 1230 12    brick home in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles
A19 1250  8    south of here on the bay, in response to a call from
A19 1260  6    the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they found Mrs.
A19 1270  3    Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor. Her
A19 1280  1    husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.
A19 1280 10       The younger son told police his brother had run
A19 1290  8    from the house after the shootings and had driven away
A19 1300  5    in their mother's car.
A19 1300  9       The description of the car was immediately broadcast
A19 1310  7    throughout Southern Maryland on police radio.
A19 1320  4    #TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED#
A19 1320  7    Police said the boys are natural brothers and were
A19 1330  6    adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
A19 1340  1       Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car, with
A19 1360  1    three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside
A19 1360 11    Annapolis. The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs'
A19 1370  7    son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station,
A19 1380  5    police said.
A19 1390  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7_
A19 1390  4       - Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins,
A19 1400  2    his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary
A19 1410  1    of State.
A19 1410  3       Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated
A19 1420  1    by Thomas B. Finan, earlier named attorney general
A19 1420  9    to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated
A19 1430  8    to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of
A19 1440  6    Appeals.
A19 1440  7       Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in
A19 1450  6    ceremony will be held in his office next Friday.
A19 1460  3    #SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET#
A19 1460  6    Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county, and
A19 1470  5    he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian, have
A19 1480  2    been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child.
A19 1490  1       Now 38, Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University
A19 1490  9    of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947.
A19 1500  6       Five years later, he was awarded the university's
A19 1510  5    degree in law.
A19 1510  8       Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member
A19 1520  9    of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958. From
A19 1530  5    the outset of his first term, he established himself
A19 1540  2    as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
A19 1550  1       MARYLAND contracts for future construction during
A19 1550  7    October totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared
A19 1560  9    to October, 1960, F. W. Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.
A19 1570  6       Dodge reported the following breakdown:
A19 1580  4       Nonresidential at $20,447,000, down 28 per cent;
A19 1590  4    residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent; and heavy
A19 1600  2    engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.
A19 1600  9       The cumulative total of construction contracts for
A19 1610  6    the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000,
A19 1620  3    a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding
A19 1630  1    period of last year.
A19 1630  5       A breakdown of the ten-month total showed:
A19 1640  2       Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent;
A19 1640  9    residential at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy
A19 1650  9    engineering at $102,285,000, down 33 per cent.
A19 1660  6       Residential building consists of houses, apartments,
A19 1670  4    hotels, dormitories and other buildings designed for
A19 1680  2    shelter.
A19 1690  1       The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments,
A19 1690 11    which began about six years ago, has more than tripled
A19 1700 10    within that span of time.
A19 1710  2       In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings
A19 1720  1    will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in
A19 1720 12    residential construction.
A19 1730  1       While availability of mortgage money has been a
A19 1730  9    factor in encouraging apartment construction, the generally
A19 1740  7    high level of prosperity in the past few years plus
A19 1750  8    rising consumer income are among the factors that have
A19 1760  5    encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building
A19 1770  1    field.
A19 1770  2       Although economic and personal circumstances vary
A19 1780  2    widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J.
A19 1780 10    Pantas, vice president of a hardware manufacturing
A19 1790  7    company, pointed out recently that many apartment seekers
A19 1800  5    seem to have one characteristic in common: a desire
A19 1810  3    for greater convenience and freedom from the problems
A19 1820  1    involved in maintaining a house.
A19 1820  6    #CONVENIENCE HELD KEY#
A19 1820  9    "Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market
A19 1830  9    today. Trouble-free, long-life, quality components
A19 1840  5    will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising
A19 1850  5    of new housing in 1960", Pantas predicted.
A19 1870  1       SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the
A19 1870 10    165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill
A19 1880  8    section.
A19 1880  9       Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units,
A19 1890  7    in two-story and three-story structures. Various of
A19 1900  4    the apartments are of the terrace type, being on the
A19 1910  3    ground floor so that entrance is direct. Others, which
A19 1910 12    are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs,
A19 1920 10    have balconies.
A19 1930  1       The structures housing the apartments are of masonry
A19 1930  9    and frame construction. Heating is by individual gas-fired,
A19 1940  7    forced warm air systems.
A19 1960  1       CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per
A19 1960 10    cent of the gross national product, according to a
A19 1970  8    study by Johns-Manville Corporation.
