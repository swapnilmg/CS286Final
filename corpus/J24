J24 0010  1    Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and
J24 0010 10    concerned about persistent economic difficulties due
J24 0020  5    to her husband's marginal income, her defense of denial
J24 0030  5    was excessively strong. Thus the lack of effective
J24 0040  1    recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring
J24 0040  8    for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling
J24 0050  8    problem. The result, dramatically visible in a matter
J24 0060  5    of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning,
J24 0070  2    was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would
J24 0070 12    befall the second twin, whose birth had not been anticipated.
J24 0080 10    Soon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown
J24 0090 10    panic concerning the welfare of the entire family.
J24 0100  7    Inability to care for the other children, difficulty
J24 0110  3    in feeding the babies, who seemed colicky, bone-weary
J24 0120  1    fatigue, repeated crying episodes, and short tempers
J24 0120  8    reflected the family's helplessness in coping with
J24 0130  7    the stressful situation. Clearly, this was a family
J24 0140  5    in crisis.
J24 0140  7       Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her
J24 0150  6    feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of
J24 0160  4    her mother's death when she was eight, as well as her
J24 0160 15    subsequent anger at her father for remarrying. Her
J24 0170  8    previous traumatic experiences flashed through her
J24 0180  4    mind as if they had happened yesterday. On the anniversary
J24 0190  4    of her father's death she poured out with agonized
J24 0200  1    tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended
J24 0200 10    his funeral. In the family's own words (during the
J24 0210  8    third of twelve visits), they had "reached the crisis
J24 0220  5    peak- either the situation will give or we will break"!
J24 0240  3       Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs. B.'s
J24 0250  2    anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears
J24 0260  1    of annihilation. Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt
J24 0260  9    concerning the death of her parents, when linked up
J24 0270  8    with her current feelings of anger and her fears of
J24 0280  5    loss, abandonment, and annihilation, produced further
J24 0290  1    relief of tension. In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs.
J24 0290 11    B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger
J24 0300  9    son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings
J24 0310  8    of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins.
J24 0320  5    The father, accurately perceiving the child's needs,
J24 0330  2    not only respected them as worthy of his attention,
J24 0330 11    but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his
J24 0340  8    lap along with the twins, saying, "I have a big lap;
J24 0360  7    there is room for you, too, Johnnie". Simultaneously,
J24 0370  2    a variety of environmental supports- a calm but not
J24 0390  1    too motherly homemaker, referral for temporary economic
J24 0390  8    aid, intelligent use of nursing care, accompaniment
J24 0400  6    to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins'
J24 0410  5    feeding problem- combined to prevent further development
J24 0430  2    of predictable pathological mechanisms. Follow-up visits
J24 0440  1    of the nurse and social worker indicated continued
J24 0440  9    success in the care of the new babies as well as a
J24 0450 10    marked improvement in the family's day-to-day mental
J24 0460  5    health and social functioning.
J24 0460  9       As seen in the B. family, there must be an attempt
J24 0470 10    to help the client develop conscious awareness of the
J24 0480  5    problem, especially in the absence of a formal request
J24 0490  3    for assistance. The lack of awareness usually springs
J24 0500  1    from deep but disguised anxiety, often assuming the
J24 0500  9    superficial guise of "not knowing" or "not caring".
J24 0510  7    The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction
J24 0520  5    to a stress must be handled through the medium of a
J24 0530  3    positive controlled transference. In general, the approach
J24 0530 10    is more active than passive, more out-reaching than
J24 0540  9    reflective. While some regression is inevitable, it
J24 0550  5    is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference
J24 0560  5    does not follow the stages of planned regression associated
J24 0570  2    with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic
J24 0580  1    model for insight therapy.
J24 0580  5       To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship
J24 0590  2    the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness
J24 0600  1    immediately, preferably within the first interview,
J24 0600  7    by meeting the client's specific needs. These needs
J24 0610  7    usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief
J24 0620  6    of tension. The initial interview must be therapeutic
J24 0630  3    rather than purely exploratory in an information-seekingsense.
J24 0640  1    In this relationship-building stage the worker must
J24 0640  9    communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal
J24 0650  8    with the problem. In so doing he implicitly offers
J24 0660  6    the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational
J24 0670  3    dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and
J24 0670 10    hopelessness generally associated with the first stages
J24 0680  7    of stress impact. Thus, the client receives enough
J24 0690  6    ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his
J24 0700  4    own behalf. Here there is a specific preventive component
J24 0710  1    which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework
J24 0710 11    situation. We are preventing or averting pathogenic
J24 0720  7    phenomena such as undue regression, unhealthy suppression
J24 0730  4    and repression, excessive use of denial, and crippling
J24 0740  4    guilt turned against the self. While some suppression
J24 0750  1    and some denial are not only necessary but healthy,
J24 0750 10    the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how
J24 0760  6    these defenses are being used, what healthy shifts
J24 0770  4    in defensive adaptation are indicated, and when efforts
J24 0780  2    at bringing about change can be most effectively timed.
J24 0790  1       In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away
J24 0790 10    from maladaptive responses, the worker uses time-honored
J24 0800  7    focused casework techniques of specific emotional support,
J24 0810  5    clarification, and anticipatory guidance. Over a relatively
J24 0820  4    short period of time, usually about four to twelve
J24 0830  1    weeks, the worker must be able to shift the focus,
J24 0830 11    back and forth, between immediate external stressful
J24 0840  5    exigencies ("precipitating stress") and the key, emotionally
J24 0850  5    relevant issues ("underlying problem") which are, often
J24 0860  4    in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough, reactivated
J24 0870  1    by the crisis situation, and hence once again amenable
J24 0870 10    to resolution. Though there is obviously nothing new
J24 0880  7    about these techniques, they do challenge the worker's
J24 0890  5    skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and
J24 0900  3    on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments.
J24 0910  1    Then, too, the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary
J24 0910  9    in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented
J24 0920  6    home visits, single and group office interviews, and
J24 0930  4    appropriate telephone follow-up calls, if the worker
J24 0940  3    is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted
J24 0940 12    unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance
J24 0950  9    with the principles of preventive intervention. In
J24 0960  5    addition, in many cases, a variety of concrete social
J24 0970  3    resources- homemaker, day care, medical and financial
J24 0990  1    aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support
J24 0990  9    needed to bolster the family in its individual and
J24 1000  8    collective coping and integrative efforts. At certain
J24 1010  4    critical stages, and only for sound diagnostic reasons,
J24 1020  2    it may be important to accompany family members in
J24 1020 11    their use of these resources if their problem-solving
J24 1030  8    behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating.
J24 1040  4    While expensive in time and involving a great deal
J24 1050  4    of adaptation on the part of the worker (in terms of
J24 1050 15    his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office
J24 1060  9    and enter actively into the client's life), techniques
J24 1070  5    of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value
J24 1080  3    when in the service of specific preventive objectives.
J24 1090  1    Finally, whatever the techniques used, a twin goal
J24 1090  9    is common to all preventive casework service: to cushion
J24 1100  6    or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the
J24 1110  6    same time to encourage and support family members to
J24 1120  3    mobilize and use their ego capacities.
J24 1120  9       Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice
J24 1130  8    of preventive casework, we now address ourselves to
J24 1140  5    our final question: What place should brief, crisis-oriented
J24 1150  3    preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of
J24 1160  1    services? We should first recognize our tendency to
J24 1160  9    develop a hierarchy of values, locating brief treatment
J24 1170  6    at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the
J24 1180  5    top, instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum,
J24 1190  4    each important in its own right. This problem is perhaps
J24 1200  1    as old as social casework itself. Almost three decades
J24 1200 10    ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact
J24 1210  8    interviewing because of her conviction that short-term
J24 1220  6    casework had an important but neglected place in our
J24 1230  4    network of social services. Her conclusion has been
J24 1230 12    borne out in the experience of many practitioners:
J24 1240  8    "... short-contact interviewing is neither a truncated
J24 1250  6    nor a telescoped experience but is of the same essential
J24 1260  6    quality as the so-called intensive case work". Thus,
J24 1280  1    casework involving a limited number of interviews is
J24 1280  9    still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service
J24 1290  9    rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended.
J24 1300  5       That we are experiencing an upsurge of interest
J24 1310  3    in the many formulations and preventive adaptations
J24 1310 10    of brief treatment in social casework is evident from
J24 1320  9    even a small sampling of current literature. Especially
J24 1330  5    noteworthy is Levinger's finding that the length of
J24 1340  5    treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of successful
J24 1350  2    outcome. According to a number of studies, the important
J24 1360  1    predictors are the nature and management of the client's
J24 1360 10    anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping
J24 1380  8    person. For example, the level of improvement noted
J24 1390  4    in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate
J24 1400  2    treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared
J24 1400  9    favorably with the results reported by typical child
J24 1410  8    guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic
J24 1420  7    study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted
J24 1430  5    to actual treatment interviews in the experimental
J24 1440  1    project. Of startling significance, too, is the assertion
J24 1440  9    that it was possible to carry out this program with
J24 1450 10    only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a
J24 1460  6    rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group
J24 1470  2    of families who were receiving help in traditionally
J24 1470 10    operated child guidance services. These reports refer
J24 1480  7    to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance
J24 1490  6    clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary
J24 1500  3    referral by the family or by other professional people.
J24 1510  1    Similarities to the approach which I have described
J24 1510  9    are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping
J24 1520  7    relationship, quick appraisal of key issues, and the
J24 1530  5    immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential
J24 1540  2    dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts
J24 1540 11    in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses.
J24 1550 10    While there are many different possibilities for the
J24 1560  7    timing of casework intervention, the experiments recently
J24 1580  4    reported from a variety of traditional settings all
J24 1590  2    point up the importance of an immediate response to
J24 1590 11    the client's initial need for help. In some programs,
J24 1600  8    treatment is concentrated over a short period of time,
J24 1610  7    while in others, after the initial contact is established,
J24 1620  4    flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally
J24 1630  1    used with apparent success. Willingness to take the
J24 1630  9    risk of early and direct interpretation (with the proviso
J24 1640  8    that if the interpretation is too threatening, the
J24 1650  5    worker can withdraw) is another prominent feature in
J24 1660  3    these efforts. My aim in mentioning this factor obviously
J24 1670  1    is not to give license to "wild therapy" but rather
J24 1670 11    to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework
J24 1680  9    skills we already possess, and to use them with greater
J24 1690  7    confidence, precision, and professional pride.
J24 1700  2       Though there is obviously great need for continued
J24 1710  1    experimentation with various types of short-term intervention
J24 1710  9    to further efforts in developing an operational definition
J24 1720  7    of prevention at the secondary- or perhaps, in some
J24 1730  7    instances, primary- level, the place of short-term
J24 1740  5    intervention has already been documented by a number
J24 1750  1    of investigators in a wide variety of settings. Woodward,
J24 1750 10    for example, has emphasized the "need for a broad spectrum
J24 1760  9    of services, including very brief services in connection
J24 1770  6    with critical situations". Ideally, brief treatment
J24 1780  3    should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather
J24 1800  1    than as a treatment of chance. Moreover, the shortage
J24 1800 10    of treatment resources and the chronically persistent
J24 1810  6    shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate
J24 1820  5    additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques
J24 1830  2    to make services more widely available- and on a more
J24 1840  2    effective basis to more people. Further research in
J24 1840 10    the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers
J24 1850  8    of traditional social casework services- including
J24 1860  2    attempts to develop a typology of family structures,
J24 1870  1    crisis problems, reaction mechanisms, and differential
J24 1870  7    treatment approaches- and the establishment of new
J24 1880  6    experimental programs are imperative social needs which
J24 1890  5    should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration
J24 1900  3    with community planners.
J24 1900  6       our literature is already replete with a fantastic
J24 1910  7    number of suggestions for preventive agency programming
J24 1920  3    ranging from the immediately practical to the globally
J24 1930  2    utopian. Probably, in the immediate future, we will
J24 1930 10    have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short
J24 1940  9    of utopian models. Increased experimentation with multipurpose
J24 1950  4    agencies, especially those that combine afresh the
J24 1960  5    traditional functions of family and child welfare services,
J24 1970  2    holds rich promise for the future. For example, child
J24 1970 11    welfare experience abounds with cases in which the
J24 1980  8    parental request for substitute care is precipitated
J24 1990  5    by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with
J24 2000  3    a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships.
