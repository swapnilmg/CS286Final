A15 0010  1       If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the
A15 0010 10    Phillies, they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower
A15 0020  9    start this season.
A15 0030  1       "Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat", Mauch
A15 0030  9    said here the other day. "The Pirates showed they could
A15 0040  9    outclass the field last year. They have the same men,
A15 0050  8    no age problem, no injuries and they also have Vinegar
A15 0060  5    Bend Mizell for the full season, along with Bobby Shantz".
A15 0070  3       Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals, who gave the
A15 0080  3    Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960, breaking
A15 0080 13    even with them, will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's
A15 0090 11    world champions. The Pirates have a 9-6 record this
A15 0100  9    year and the Redbirds are 7-9.
A15 0110  3    #CHANGE IN PITCHERS.#
A15 0110  6    Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher,
A15 0120  3    from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio, for several reasons:
A15 0130  2    1. Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run
A15 0130 13    mark against Pittsburgh a year ago; 2. The desire to
A15 0140 10    give Broglio as many starts as possible; 3. The Redbirds'
A15 0150  8    disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday.
A15 0160  5       Manager Hemus, eager to end a pitching slump that
A15 0170  6    has brought four losses in the five games on the current
A15 0180  4    home stand, moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting
A15 0190  1    assignment. After Thursday's open date, Solly plans
A15 0190  8    to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday
A15 0200  8    night.
A15 0200  9       Harvey Haddix, set back by the flu this season,
A15 0210  9    will start against his former Cardinal mates, who might
A15 0220  5    be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's
A15 0230  3    game at Busch Stadium. Boyer is suffering from a stiff
A15 0240  1    neck.
A15 0240  2       Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds, despite
A15 0250  1    only a 1-3 mark in 1960.
A15 0250  8       Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided
A15 0260  5    between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game. Mizell
A15 0270  3    has won both of his starts.
A15 0270  9    #NIEMAN KEPT IN LINEUP.#
A15 0280  1    After a lengthy workout yesterday, an open date, Hemus
A15 0280 10    said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup.
A15 0290  9    That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench
A15 0300  7    on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home
A15 0310  4    run day against the Giants.
A15 0310  9       "I have to stay with Nieman for a while", Hemus
A15 0320  7    said. "Bill White (sore ankles) should be ready. With
A15 0330  5    a lefthander going for Pittsburgh, I may use Don Taussig
A15 0340  4    in center".
A15 0340  6       "Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25
A15 0350  4    minutes, and he looked good", Hemus said. "He should
A15 0360  2    be getting back in the groove before long. Our pitching
A15 0370  1    is much better than it has shown".
A15 0370  8       The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates
A15 0380  4    needed extra batting practice, but Murtaugh also turned
A15 0390  3    his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday.
A15 0390 10    #SIX BUCKS OVER .300.#
A15 0400  2    Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati
A15 0410  1    over the weekend, the champions had eight men hitting
A15 0410 10    over .300. Despite the recession, Pittsburgh came into
A15 0420  6    town with this imposing list of averages: Smoky Burgess
A15 0430  5    .455, Gino Cimoli .389, Bill Virdon .340, Bob Clemente
A15 0440  4    and Dick Groat, each .323, Dick Stuart .306, Don Hoak
A15 0450  3    .280 and Bob Skinner .267.
A15 0450  8       Bill Mazeroski with .179 and Hal Smith with .143
A15 0460  7    were the only Pirates dragging their feet.
A15 0470  2       Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over
A15 0470 11    the news that Musial probably will sit out most of
A15 0480 10    the series is Bob Friend, who was beaten by The Man
A15 0490  7    twice last season on dramatic home runs. Friend is
A15 0500  4    off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely
A15 0510  1    to see action here this week.
A15 0510  7       "We're getting Friend some runs for a change, and
A15 0520  7    he has been pitching good", Murtaugh said. "Virdon
A15 0530  2    has been blasting the ball. No plunkers for him".
A15 0540  1    #SIX BUCS OVER .300.#
A15 0540  4    The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last
A15 0550  3    year, when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held
A15 0550 13    them even over the season. On last May 1, the Cardinals
A15 0560 11    stood at 7-6, ending a two-season fall-off on that
A15 0570  8    milestone. In 1958, the Birds were 3-10 on May 1. A
A15 0580  7    year later they were 4-13.
A15 0580 13       Since 1949, the St. Louis club has been below .500
A15 0590  8    on May 1 just four times. The '49 team was off to a
A15 0600  7    so-so 5-5 beginning, then fell as low as 12-17 on May
A15 0610  3    23 before finishing with 96 victories.
A15 0610  9       The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88
A15 0620 11    triumphs, the club's top since 1949. Then last season
A15 0630  5    the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before
A15 0640  3    recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories.
A15 0640 14       Since 1949, the only National League club that got
A15 0650 10    off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was
A15 0660 10    the '55 Dodger team. Those Dodgers won their first
A15 0670  5    10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead
A15 0680  2    by May 8. The club that overcame the worst start in
A15 0680 13    a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's
A15 0690  9    '51 Giants, who dropped 11 of their first 13.
A15 0710  1       They honored the battling Billikens last night.
A15 0710  8    Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise
A15 0720  8    to a group of St. Louis University players who, in
A15 0730  5    the words of Coach John Benington, "had more confidence
A15 0740  3    in themselves than I did".
A15 0740  8       The most valuable player award was split three ways,
A15 0750  7    among Glen Mankowski, Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer.
A15 0760  5    In addition, a special award was given to Bob (Bevo)
A15 0770  4    Nordmann, the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the
A15 0780  2    season because of a knee injury.
A15 0780  8       "You often hear people talk about team spirit and
A15 0790  6    that sort of thing", Benington said in a conversation
A15 0800  2    after the ceremonies, "but what this team had was a
A15 0800 12    little different. The boys had a tremendous respect
A15 0810  8    for each other's ability. They knew what they could
A15 0820  7    do and it was often a little more than I thought they
A15 0830  5    could do.
A15 0840  1       "Several times I found the players pepping me up,
A15 0850  4    where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver
A15 0860  2    the fight talk. We'd be losing at halftime to a good
A15 0860 13    team and Hartweger would say, 'Don't worry, Coach-
A15 0870  8    we'll get 'em all right'".
A15 0880  3       The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were
A15 0890  2    introduced by Bob Broeg, sports editor of the Post-Dispatch.
A15 0900  1       Kieffer, the only junior in the group, was commended
A15 0900 10    for his ability to hit in the clutch, as well as his
A15 0910 11    all-round excellent play.
A15 0920  1       Mankowski, the ball-hawking defensive expert, was
A15 0920  8    cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis
A15 0930  8    U.'s nationally televised victory. Benington said,
A15 0940  5    "I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski
A15 0950  8    did against Bradley that day".
A15 0960  1       Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that
A15 0960  9    he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because
A15 0970  9    he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball
A15 0980  7    skills. After the coach listed all the boy's faults,
A15 0990  4    Hartweger said, "Coach before I leave here, you'll
A15 1000  2    get to like me".
A15 1000  6       Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what
A15 1010  5    she could to persuade her husband that the boy might
A15 1020  2    help the team.
A15 1020  5       As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl, he said,
A15 1030  3    "I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into
A15 1030 13    letting me play".
A15 1040  3       Bob Burnes, sports editor of the Globe-Democrat,
A15 1050  1    presented Bob Nordmann with his award. Bevo was congratulated
A15 1050 10    for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help
A15 1060 12    the team if his knee healed in time. Within a week
A15 1070  8    after the injury, suffered in St. Louis's victory in
A15 1080  4    the final game of the Kentucky tournament, Nordmann
A15 1090  1    was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could
A15 1090 11    to help Benington.
A15 1100  2       On the clock given him was the inscription, "For
A15 1110  1    Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball, 1960-61".
A15 1110  8       Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9
A15 1120 11    record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation
A15 1130  8    Tournament were: Art Hambric, Donnell Reid, Bill Nordmann,
A15 1140  7    Dave Harris, Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich.
A15 1150  4       "This team set a precedent that could be valuable
A15 1160  5    in the future", Benington pointed out. "By winning
A15 1170  2    against Bradley, Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams'
A15 1180  1    home courts, they showed that the home court advantage
A15 1180 10    can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn's take a
A15 1190  8    super team to do it".
A15 1200  1       St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball
A15 1200 11    game. Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game,
A15 1210  9    said to be the first in Billiken baseball history,
A15 1220  5    as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State
A15 1230  3    College, 5-1, at Crystal City.
A15 1230  9       The victory was the first of the season for the
A15 1240  9    Billikens after nine defeats and a tie. The tie was
A15 1250  6    against Southeast Missouri last Friday.
A15 1260  1       Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits
A15 1260 11    in five trips including a double, Len Boehmer also
A15 1270  6    was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a
A15 1280  4    home run and a triple.
A15 1280  9       St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with
A15 1290  9    a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University
A15 1300  2    at Ligget Field.
A15 1300  5       The game opened a busy week for Washington. The
A15 1310  5    Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at
A15 1320  3    3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy, Ill.,
A15 1330  1    Saturday.
A15 1340  1    #HAPPY HITTING#
A15 1340  3    If it's true that contented cows give more milk, why
A15 1350  2    shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits?
A15 1360  1       The two top talents of the time, Mickey Mantle and
A15 1360 11    Willie Mays, have hit the ball harder and more successfully
A15 1370  8    so far this early season than at any period in careers
A15 1380  7    which, to be frank about it, never have quite reached
A15 1390  3    expectations.
A15 1390  4       And that's meant as a boost, not a knock.
A15 1400  3       Mays and Mantle, both 10-year men at 30, have so
A15 1410  1    much ability that, baseball men agree, they've never
A15 1410  9    hit the heights. Their heights, that is.
A15 1420  5       Mantle, the bull-necked blond switch-hitter, had
A15 1430  2    one sensational triple-crown season, 1959, when he
A15 1430 10    batted .365 and also led the American League in home
A15 1440 10    runs, 52, and RBIs, 130.
A15 1450  2       Like the Yankees' slugger, Mays, the terror of the
A15 1460  2    Giants, has had seasons that would be considered the
A15 1460 11    ultimate by most players, but not by- or for- Willie.
A15 1470  9    His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers
A15 1480  8    and '55 when he belted 51 home runs, drove in 127 and
A15 1490  5    stole 24 bases.
A15 1490  8       Now, apparently happier under new managers, Mays
A15 1500  5    and Mantle, the perfect players, are behaving as though
A15 1510  3    they're going to pass those previous peaks.
A15 1510 10    #LABOR RELATIONS#
A15 1520  1    Yes, we know, they're professionals, men paid to play,
A15 1520 10    and they shouldn't care how they're handled, just as
A15 1530  9    long as their names are spelled correctly on the first
A15 1540  8    and fifteenth of each month.
A15 1550  1       The truth is, though, that men react differently
A15 1550  9    to different treatment. For that matter, Stan Musial
A15 1560  7    is rare, possessing the disposition that enabled him
A15 1570  4    to put out the same for seven managers, reserving his
A15 1580  2    opinions, but not his effort.
A15 1590  3       Mantle, it's apparent, resented Casey Stengel's
A15 1600  4    attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the
A15 1610  3    veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility. The
A15 1610 11    old man was almost too possessive. Stengel inherited
A15 1620  8    DiMaggio, Rizzuto, but HE brought up Mantle from Class
A15 1630  8    C to the majors, from Joplin to New York.
A15 1640  5       With the speed and power of the body beautiful he
A15 1650  3    saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only
A15 1660  2    the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter,
A15 1660 11    base-runner and outfielder. Stengel probably preached
A15 1670  5    too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop
A15 1680  6    his bubble gum and sow his oats.
A15 1680 13       Inheriting a more mature Mantle, who now has seen
A15 1690  9    the sights on and off Broadway, Ralph Houk quietly
A15 1700  4    bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of authority
A15 1710  2    on Mickey. The Major decided that, rather than be led,
A15 1720  1    the slugger could lead. And what leadership a proud
A15 1720 10    Mantle has given so far.
A15 1730  3       The opinion continues here that with a 162-game
A15 1730 12    schedule, pitching spread thin through a 10-team league
A15 1740  9    and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley
A15 1750  6    Field Jr., Mantle just might break the most glamorous
A15 1760  5    record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927.
A15 1770  3    #FOUR FOR ALVIN#
A15 1770  6    Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the
A15 1780  5    kids and Commies this year. Willie's wonderful walloping
A15 1790  2    Sunday- four home runs- served merely to emphasize
A15 1790 10    how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.
A15 1800 10       Next to Leo Durocher, Dark taught Mays the most
A15 1810  6    when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo
A15 1820  5    Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants
A15 1830  1    win a dramatic pennant.
