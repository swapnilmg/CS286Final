G20 0010  1    It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative
G20 0010 11    people in an organization determine the type of network
G20 0020  8    required, because the type of network functions according
G20 0030  6    to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in
G20 0040  3    Table 1. Great stress is placed on the role that the
G20 0050  2    monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining
G20 0050  9    the effectiveness of the network. By monitoring, we
G20 0060  7    mean some system of control over the types of information
G20 0070  6    sent from the various centers.
G20 0080  1       As a word of caution, we should be aware that in
G20 0080 11    actual practice no message is purely one of the four
G20 0090  8    types, question, command, statement, or exclamation.
G20 0100  3    For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving
G20 0110  1    a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk,
G20 0110 13    "What time is it"? This sentence would have most of
G20 0120 10    the characteristics of a question, but it has some
G20 0130  8    of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner
G20 0140  4    has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own
G20 0150  3    timepiece or the one attached to his car. If the man
G20 0150 14    on the sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has
G20 0160  9    served as an exclamation. Also, since the man questioned
G20 0170  6    feels a strong compulsion to answer (and thereby avoid
G20 0180  4    the consequences of being thought queer) the question
G20 0190  1    has assumed some measurable properties of a command.
G20 0190  9    However, for convenience we will stick to the idea
G20 0200  8    that information can be classified according to Table
G20 0210  4    1. On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks
G20 0220  1    will be discussed for illustrative purposes.
G20 0220  7    #NETWORKS ILLUSTRATING SOME SPECIAL TYPES OF ORGANIZATION#
G20 0240  1    _THE COCKTAIL PARTY._
G20 0240  1       Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill
G20 0240  9    the host's desire to get together a number of people
G20 0250  8    who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange
G20 0260  4    for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy
G20 0270  1    for future cooperative endeavors. The party is usually
G20 0270  9    in a room small enough so that all guests are within
G20 0280  9    sight and hearing of one another. The information is
G20 0290  4    furnished by each of the guests, is sent by oral broadcasting
G20 0300  3    over the air waves, and is received by the ears. Since
G20 0310  1    the air is a continuum, the network of communication
G20 0310 10    remains intact regardless of the positions or motions
G20 0320  7    of the points (the people) in the net. As shown in
G20 0330  7    Figure 1, there is a connection for communication between
G20 0340  2    every pair of points. This, and other qualifications,
G20 0340 10    make the cocktail party the most complete and most
G20 0350  9    chaotic communication system ever dreamed up. All four
G20 0360  7    types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted, although
G20 0370  5    decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the
G20 0380  2    commands to a minimum, while exclamations having complimentary
G20 0390  1    intonations are more than customarily encouraged. The
G20 0390  8    completeness of the connections provide that, for N
G20 0400  8    people, there are **f lines of communication between
G20 0410  5    the pairs, which can become a large number (1,225)
G20 0420  2    for a party of fifty guests. Looking at the diagram,
G20 0420 12    we see that **f connection lines come in to each member.
G20 0430 11    Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal
G20 0440  8    system, but there is one weakness. In spite of the
G20 0450  5    dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the **f
G20 0460  2    incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving
G20 0460 10    system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six.
G20 0470  7    The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups
G20 0480  6    ranging in size from two to six, with a half-life for
G20 0490  5    the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.
G20 0500  1       For the occasion on which everyone already knows
G20 0500  9    everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one
G20 0510  9    or a few honored newcomers, then the "open house" system
G20 0520  5    is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed
G20 0530  3    connective points and the drifting guests make and
G20 0530 11    break connections at the door.
G20 0540  4    _THE RURAL COMMUNITY._
G20 0540  7       We consider a rural community as an assemblage of
G20 0550  6    inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined
G20 0560  3    by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary
G20 0570  1    for family subsistence. We assume for this illustration
G20 0570  9    that the size of the land plots is so great that the
G20 0580 11    distance between dwellings is greater than the voice
G20 0590  6    can carry and that most of the communication is between
G20 0600  3    nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2. Information
G20 0610  1    beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-,
G20 0610 10    and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor. In Figure 2,
G20 0620  8    the points in the network are designated by a letter
G20 0630  5    accompanied by a number. The numbers indicate the number
G20 0640  3    of nearest neighbors. It will be noted that point f
G20 0650  1    has seven nearest neighbors, h and e have six, and
G20 0650 11    p has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate
G20 0660 10    numbers. In any social system in which communications
G20 0670  8    have an importance comparable with that of production
G20 0680  6    and other human factors, a point like f in Figure
G20 0690  5    2 would (other things being equal) be the dwelling
G20 0700  1    place for the community leader, while e and h would
G20 0710  1    house the next most important citizens. A point like
G20 0710 10    p gets information directly from n, but all information
G20 0720  8    beyond n is indirectly relayed through n. The dweller
G20 0730  8    at p is last to hear about a new cure, the slowest
G20 0740 10    to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses,
G20 0750  4    the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the one
G20 0760  2    with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over
G20 0760 11    an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative
G20 0770  9    effort. Since the hazards of poor communication are
G20 0780  5    so great, p can be justified as a habitable site only
G20 0790  3    on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made
G20 0800  1    available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine,
G20 0800 10    or a sugar maple camp. Location theorists have given
G20 0810  6    these matters much consideration.
G20 0820  1    _MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS._
G20 0820  3       The networks for military communications are one
G20 0830  3    of the best examples of networks which not only must
G20 0830 13    be changed with the changes in objectives but also
G20 0840  9    must be changed with the addition of new machines of
G20 0850  6    war. They also furnish proof that, in modern war, message
G20 0860  4    sending must be monitored. Without monitoring, a military
G20 0870  2    hookup becomes a noisy party. The need for monitoring
G20 0870 11    became greater when radio was adopted for military
G20 0880  8    signaling. Alexander the Great, who used runners as
G20 0890  6    message carriers, did not have to worry about having
G20 0900  2    every officer in his command hear what he said and
G20 0900 12    having hundreds of them comment at once. As time has
G20 0910 10    passed and science has progressed, the speed of military
G20 0920  6    vehicles has increased, the range of missiles has been
G20 0930  4    extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles
G20 0940  1    has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message
G20 0940 11    sending has increased. Next to the old problem of the
G20 0950 10    slowness of decision making, network structure seems
G20 0960  5    to be paramount, and without monitoring no network
G20 0970  3    has value.
G20 0970  5       On the parade ground the net may be similar to that
G20 0980  3    shown in Figure 3. The monitoring is the highest and
G20 0990  1    most restrictive of any organization in existence.
G20 0990  8    No questions, statements, or explanations are permitted-
G20 1000  5    only commands. Commands go only from an officer to
G20 1010  5    the man of nearest lower rank. The same command is
G20 1020  2    repeated as many times as there are levels in rank
G20 1020 12    from general to corporal. All orders originate with
G20 1030  6    the officer of highest rank and terminate with action
G20 1040  4    of the men in the ranks. Even the officer in charge,
G20 1050  1    be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is
G20 1050 12    restrained by monitoring. This is done for simplicity
G20 1060  8    of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to
G20 1070  5    where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility.
G20 1080  1    The commands are specified by the military regulations;
G20 1080  9    are few in number, briefly worded, all different in
G20 1090  9    sound; and are combinable into sequences which permit
G20 1100  5    any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade
G20 1110  5    ground. This monitoring is necessary because, on a
G20 1120  2    parade ground, everyone can hear too much, and without
G20 1120 11    monitoring a confused social event would develop.
G20 1130  7       With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather
G20 1140  6    than on the parade ground, it may seem that a certain
G20 1150  3    amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the
G20 1150 11    lines of communication. Years ago this was true, but
G20 1160  9    with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and
G20 1170  8    radar (and perhaps television), these restrictions
G20 1180  2    have disappeared and now again too much is heard.
G20 1190  1       In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations,
G20 1190  8    even in the field, are more formal. In the extreme
G20 1200 10    and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3, the
G20 1210  6    organization is more easily understood and more predictable
G20 1220  4    in behavior. A military organization has an objective
G20 1230  1    chosen by the higher command. This objective is adhered
G20 1230 10    to throughout the duration of the action. The connective
G20 1240  8    system, or network, is tailored to meet the requirements
G20 1250  7    of the objective, and it is therefore not surprising
G20 1260  3    that a military body acting as a single coordinated
G20 1270  1    unit has a different communication network than a factory,
G20 1270 10    a college, or a rural village.
G20 1280  5       The assumptions upon which the example shown in
G20 1290  2    Figure 3 is based are: (a) One man can direct about
G20 1290 13    six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully
G20 1300  7    so that they do not need too much personal coaching,
G20 1310  6    indoctrinating, etc. (b) A message runs too great
G20 1320  4    a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more
G20 1330  1    than about six consecutive times. (c) Decisions of
G20 1330  9    a general kind are made by the central command. And
G20 1340  8    (d) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the
G20 1350  4    mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower
G20 1360  1    rank. These assumptions lead to an organization with
G20 1360  9    one man at the top, six directly under him, six under
G20 1370  8    each of these, and so on until there are six levels
G20 1380  5    of personnel. The number of people acting as one body
G20 1390  2    by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of **f
G20 1390 12    55,987 men.
G20 1400  2       This organizational network would be of no avail
G20 1400 10    if there were no regulations pertaining to the types
G20 1410  8    of message sent. Of types of message listed in Table
G20 1420  6    1, commands and statements are the only ones sent through
G20 1430  4    the vertical network shown in Figure 3. A further regulation
G20 1440  2    is that commands always go down, unaccompanied by statements,
G20 1450  1    and statements always go up, unaccompanied by commands.
G20 1450  9    Questions and, particularly, exclamations are usually
G20 1460  6    channeled along informal, horizontal lines not indicated
G20 1470  5    in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest
G20 1480  4    neighbor.
G20 1480  5       It will readily be seen that in this suggested network
G20 1490  5    (not materially different from some of the networks
G20 1500  2    in vogue today) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied
G20 1500 11    than is usually put into practice. Furthermore, the
G20 1510  8    network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which
G20 1520  9    other networks pertaining to logistics and the like
G20 1530  4    are interlaced.
G20 1530  6       Not discussed here are some military problems of
G20 1540  4    modern times such as undersea warfare, where the surveillance,
G20 1550  2    sending, transmitting, and receiving are all so inadequate
G20 1560  1    that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks.
G20 1560 10    Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance
G20 1570 10    and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla
G20 1580  9    warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to
G20 1590  7    re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could
G20 1600  2    teach.
G20 1600  3    _A TEAM FOR USEFUL RESEARCH._
G20 1600  8       This is an unsolved problem which probably has never
G20 1610  6    been seriously investigated, although one frequently
G20 1620  3    hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists
G20 1630  1    of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss,
G20 1630 12    for example, in precision machinery and mathematics,
G20 1640  6    or the Finns in geochemistry. We hear equally fervent
G20 1650  5    concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists
G20 1660  4    who can see the over-all picture and combine our national
G20 1670  3    skills and knowledge for useful purposes. This problem
G20 1680  1    of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists
G20 1680 11    and specialists can be investigated on a communicative
G20 1690  8    network basis. Since the difficulty of drawing the
G20 1700  6    net is great, we will merely discuss it.
G20 1710  2       First, we realize that a pure specialist does not
G20 1710 11    exist. But, for practical purposes, we have people
G20 1720  7    who can be considered as such. For example, there are
G20 1730  5    persons who are in physical science, in the field of
G20 1750  3    mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only
G20 1750 10    X-rays, applying only the powder technique of X-ray
G20 1760  9    diffraction, to clay minerals only, and who have spent
G20 1770  7    the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites;
G20 1780  4    or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology,
G20 1790  4    studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians.
G20 1800  2    So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more
G20 1800 14    and more about less and less as he develops, as contrasted
G20 1810 10    to the generalist, who knows less and less about more
G20 1820  8    and more.
