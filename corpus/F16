F16 0010  1    ##
F16 0010  2    On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark,
F16 0010 12    Discovery, weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool,
F16 0020  7    London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea.
F16 0030  8    She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one
F16 0040  6    and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic
F16 0050  4    waters of North America.
F16 0050  8       Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an
F16 0060  6    Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward
F16 0070  3    outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, she was
F16 0080  3    found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation.
F16 0080 14    The captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man
F16 0090 11    who now commanded her had started the voyage as an
F16 0100  8    ordinary seaman.
F16 0100 10       What disaster struck the Discovery during those
F16 0110  6    seventeen months? What happened to the fourteen missing
F16 0120  5    men? These questions have remained one of the great
F16 0130  5    sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the
F16 0140  1    evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary
F16 0140  9    journal, (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of
F16 0150  9    the survivors, (3) a note found in a dead man's desk
F16 0160  7    on board, and (4) several second-hand reports. All
F16 0170  3    told, they offered a highly confused picture.
F16 0170 10       But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient
F16 0180  7    court records and legal files have been able to find
F16 0190  7    illuminating pieces of information. Not enough to do
F16 0200  4    away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly
F16 0200 14    accurate picture of the events of the voyage.
F16 0210  8       Historians have had two reasons for persisting so
F16 0220  6    long in their investigations. First, they wanted to
F16 0230  4    clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they
F16 0230 11    believed it important to determine the fate of the
F16 0240  9    captain- a man whose name is permanently stamped on
F16 0250  6    our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great
F16 0260  4    American river, and on half a million square miles
F16 0270  1    of Arctic seas.
F16 0270  4       The name: Henry Hudson.
F16 0270  8       This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as
F16 0280 10    nearly as we are able- or ever, probably, will be able-
F16 0290  6    to determine:
F16 0290  8       The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth
F16 0300  8    in four years. Each time his objective had been the
F16 0310  6    same- a direct water passage from Western Europe to
F16 0320  3    the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy
F16 0330  1    Company had sent him northward to look for a route
F16 0330 11    over the North Pole or across the top of Russia. Twice
F16 0340  8    he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it
F16 0350  4    would not back him again.
F16 0350  9       In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson,
F16 0360  7    gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with
F16 0370  5    a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with
F16 0380  3    Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the
F16 0390  1    middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery
F16 0390 10    was important- the Great North (later, the Hudson)
F16 0400  9    River- but it produced no northwest passage.
F16 0410  4    ##
F16 0410  5    When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in
F16 0420  4    the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked
F16 0430  2    out, and English interest in him revived. The government
F16 0440  1    forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.
F16 0440 10    He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking
F16 0450  8    to men of wealth. By springtime, he was supported by
F16 0460  5    a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry,
F16 0470  3    Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a
F16 0470 12    veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited
F16 0480  8    a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded.
F16 0490  7       The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear. A century
F16 0500  7    of exploration had established that a great land mass,
F16 0510  5    North and South America, lay between Europe and the
F16 0520  2    Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that
F16 0520 12    promised a passage through had been explored and discarded.
F16 0530  8    In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had
F16 0540  8    disposed of one of the last hopes.
F16 0550  1       But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap,
F16 0550  8    far to the north. Nearly twenty-five years before,
F16 0560  8    Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the
F16 0570  7    Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the water whirling
F16 0580  3    and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He named
F16 0590  2    this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the
F16 0590 10    "Furious Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson
F16 0600  9    Strait.)
F16 0610  1       In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery
F16 0610 10    that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up
F16 0620  9    the strait before his frightened men turned the ship
F16 0630  6    back. Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through
F16 0640  3    and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.
F16 0640 13       Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined
F16 0650  9    as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the
F16 0660 11    Thames. Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters. On
F16 0670  5    previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous
F16 0680  3    situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.
F16 0690  1    On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen
F16 0690 12    island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a
F16 0700  9    certificate stating that he did so of his own free
F16 0710  8    will- which was obviously not the case. On the third
F16 0720  3    voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between
F16 0720 12    Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had
F16 0730 10    almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam
F16 0740  8    in mid-Atlantic.
F16 0740 11       Worse, his present crew included five men who had
F16 0750  9    sailed with him before. Of only one could he be sure-
F16 0760  7    young John Hudson, his second son. The mate, Robert
F16 0770  3    Juet, who had kept the journal on the half Moon, was
F16 0780  2    experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to
F16 0780 12    complain or desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe,
F16 0790  7    the ship's carpenter, was a good worker, but perversely
F16 0800  6    independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like
F16 0810  4    the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson in
F16 0820  2    a crisis.
F16 0820  4       But men willing to sail at all into waters where
F16 0830  1    wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to
F16 0830 11    find. Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as
F16 0840 11    he remained an explorer. And he refused to be anything
F16 0850  6    else.
F16 0850  7       It is believed that Hudson was related to other
F16 0860  5    seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained
F16 0870  1    on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with
F16 0870 10    three sons. (The common misconception that he was Dutch
F16 0880  8    and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch
F16 0890  6    documents of his third voyage.) In 1610, Hudson was
F16 0900  3    probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a
F16 0900 12    stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to
F16 0910  7    his chosen profession.
F16 0920  1    ##
F16 0920  2    Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred
F16 0920 10    only a few miles down the Thames. There at the river's
F16 0930 10    edge waited one Henry Greene, whom Hudson listed as
F16 0940  6    a "clerk". Greene was in actuality a young ruffian
F16 0950  4    from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order
F16 0960  2    to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and
F16 0960 11    whores. He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted
F16 0970 10    his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait
F16 0980  6    at Gravesend, where the Discovery picked him up.
F16 0990  3       For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the
F16 1000  1    east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward.
F16 1000  9    On May 11, she reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog
F16 1010  7    locked her up in a harbor the crew called "Lousie Bay".
F16 1020  5    The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome.
F16 1030  3    With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked a
F16 1040  2    fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue
F16 1040 11    was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining
F16 1050  9    ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back
F16 1060  8    to England. With difficulty, Hudson persuaded him to
F16 1070  5    rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.
F16 1080  1    ##
F16 1080  2    Early in June, the Discovery passed "Desolation" (southern
F16 1090  2    Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".
F16 1100  1    Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog
F16 1100 11    hung over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose
F16 1110  8    as much as fifty feet. The ship's compass was useless
F16 1120  6    because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole.
F16 1130  3       As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was forced to turn
F16 1140  4    south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the
F16 1150  1    great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere,
F16 1150 10    however, he turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled
F16 1160  9    passageway- and the crew, at first uneasy, then frightened,
F16 1170  7    rebelled.
F16 1170  8       The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing. For
F16 1180  8    weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing
F16 1190  5    through to Java was absurd. The great, crushing ice
F16 1200  3    masses coming into view made him sound like the voice
F16 1210  1    of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson
F16 1210 11    that they would sail no farther.
F16 1220  4       Instead of quelling the dissension, as many captains
F16 1230  2    of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped
F16 1230 12    a man's head off under similar circumstances), Hudson
F16 1240  7    decided to be reasonable. He went to his cabin and
F16 1250  7    emerged carrying a large chart, which he set up in
F16 1260  5    view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew
F16 1270  1    about their course and their objectives.
F16 1270  7       When Hudson had finished, the "town meeting" broke
F16 1280  5    down into a general, wordy argument. One man remarked
F16 1290  4    that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety
F16 1300  1    of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe,
F16 1300 12    who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home. The
F16 1310 11    statement was effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson
F16 1320  7    was free to sail on.
F16 1320 12    ##
F16 1320 13    All through July the Discovery picked her way along
F16 1330  9    the 450-mile-long strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands.
F16 1340  7    On August 3, two massive headlands reared out of the
F16 1350  6    mists- great gateways never before, so far as Hudson
F16 1360  5    knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape a
F16 1370  2    thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated
F16 1370 11    by thousands of screaming sea birds. To port was a
F16 1380  9    point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of
F16 1390  5    2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme,
F16 1400  2    for two of his backers.
F16 1400  7       Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast
F16 1410  5    of the newly discovered sea (now called Hudson Bay),
F16 1420  3    confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the
F16 1430  1    Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however,
F16 1430  8    the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river
F16 1440  8    deltas. The ship halted. The great "sea to the westwards"
F16 1450  6    was a dead end.
F16 1450 10       This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery.
F16 1460  5    For he seemed to sense at once that before him was
F16 1470  5    no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North American
F16 1480  2    continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed
F16 1480 11    to know he was destined to failure.
F16 1490  7       Feverishly, he tried to brush away this intuition.
F16 1500  4    North and south, east and west, back and forth he sailed
F16 1510  3    in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until
F16 1510 12    land appeared, then turning to repeat the process,
F16 1520  8    day after day, week after week. Hundreds of miles to
F16 1530  6    the north, the route back to England through the "Furious
F16 1540  4    Overfall" was again filling with ice.
F16 1550  1       The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the
F16 1550 11    aimless tacking. Once more, Juet's complaints were
F16 1560  6    the loudest. Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate
F16 1570  6    of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove his
F16 1580  2    charges in an open trial.
F16 1580  7       The trial was held September 10. Hudson, presiding,
F16 1590  4    heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony from
F16 1600  2    crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several
F16 1600 10    men stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley
F16 1610  8    and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade
F16 1620  8    them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins. Cook
F16 1630  5    Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on
F16 1640  3    the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn
F16 1640 13    the ship homeward.
F16 1650  3       Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new mate
F16 1660  2    was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There
F16 1660  9    were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way
F16 1670  9    individuals had conducted themselves. The important
F16 1680  3    result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens,
F16 1690  2    the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
F16 1700  1       As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of
F16 1700  9    the little bay, every incident lessened the crew's
F16 1710  7    respect for him. Once, after the Discovery lay for
F16 1720  6    a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered the anchor
F16 1730  3    raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being
F16 1740  1    hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and
F16 1740 11    Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.
F16 1750  9    The anchor cable would have been lost overboard, but
F16 1760  6    Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe.
