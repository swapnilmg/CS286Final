J23 0010  1    #II: SOME OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RELIGION#
J23 0010  9    The place of religion in the simple, preliterate societies
J23 0020  7    is quite definite; as a complex it fits into the whole
J23 0030  8    social organization and functions dominantly in every
J23 0040  3    part of it. In societies like ours, however, its place
J23 0050  1    is less clear and more complex. With the diversity
J23 0050 10    of religious viewpoints, there are differences of opinion
J23 0060  6    as to the essential features of religion; and there
J23 0070  5    are different opinions as to the essential functions
J23 0080  2    of religion. Nevertheless, for most of the population
J23 0080 10    of heterogeneous advanced societies, though less for
J23 0090  6    the less religious portion, religion does perform certain
J23 0100  5    modal individual and social functions.
J23 0110  1       Although the inner functions of religion are not
J23 0110  9    of direct significance in social organization, they
J23 0120  6    have important indirect consequences. If the inner
J23 0130  4    functions of religion are performed, the individual
J23 0140  1    is a composed, ordered, motivated, and emotionally
J23 0140  8    secure associate; he is not greatly frustrated, and
J23 0150  7    he is not anomic; he is better fitted to perform his
J23 0160  6    social life among his fellows. There are several closely
J23 0170  3    related inner functions.
J23 0170  6       In the last analysis, religion is the means of inducing,
J23 0180  7    formulating, expressing, enhancing, implementing, and
J23 0190  3    perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious.
J23 0210  1    Man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow.
J23 0210  8    Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence.
J23 0220  9    The significant things in it, at the higher religious
J23 0240  8    levels, are the inner emotional, mental, and spiritual
J23 0250  4    occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of
J23 0260  2    self-preservation,
J23 0260  4    self-pacification, and self-completion. The chief experience
J23 0270  2    is the sensing of communion, and in the higher religions,
J23 0280  1    of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural
J23 0280  8    power. Related to this is the fact that most of the
J23 0290  9    higher religions define for the individual his place
J23 0300  3    in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively
J23 0310  1    secure in an ordered, dependable universe. Man has
J23 0310  9    the experience of being helpfully allied with what
J23 0320  7    he cannot fully understand; he is a coordinate part
J23 0330  6    of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement.
J23 0340  2    The universe is a safe and permanent home.
J23 0340 10       A number of religions also satisfy for many the
J23 0350  8    need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal.
J23 0360  4    Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance; man
J23 0370  2    has a second chance. He is not lost in the abyss of
J23 0370 14    endless time; he has endless being. Religion at its
J23 0380  9    best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment
J23 0390  5    by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit.
J23 0400  4    Religion can summate, epitomize, relate, and conserve
J23 0410  1    all the highest ideals and values- ethical, aesthetic,
J23 0410  9    and religious- of man formed in his culture.
J23 0420  9       There is also the possibility, among higher religions,
J23 0440  4    of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying
J23 0450  3    guidance and expansiveness. The kind of religious experience
J23 0460  1    that most moderns seek not only provides, clarifies,
J23 0460  9    and relates human yearnings, values, ideals, and purposes;
J23 0470  7    it also provides facilities and incitements for the
J23 0480  5    development of personality, sociality, and creativeness.
J23 0490  3    Under the religious impulse, whether theistic or humanistic,
J23 0510  2    men have joy in living; life leads somewhere. Religion
J23 0520  1    at its best is out in front, ever beckoning and leading
J23 0520 12    on, and, as Lippman put it, "mobilizing all man's scattered
J23 0530  7    energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite
J23 0540  6    importance".
J23 0540  7       At the same time that religion binds the individual
J23 0560  6    helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic
J23 0570  4    peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment, it also has
J23 0580  1    great therapeutic value for him. It gives him aid,
J23 0580 10    comfort, even solace, in meeting mundane life situations
J23 0590  6    where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill
J23 0600  4    are felt by him to be inadequate. He is confronted
J23 0610  1    with the recurrent crises, such as great natural catastrophes
J23 0610 10    and the great transitions of life- marriage, incurable
J23 0620  8    disease, widowhood, old age, the certainty of death.
J23 0640  7    He has to cope with frustration and other emotional
J23 0650  4    disturbance and anomie. His religious beliefs provide
J23 0660  1    him with plausible explanations for many conditions
J23 0660  8    which cause him great concern, and his religious faith
J23 0670  8    makes possible fortitude, equanimity, and consolation,
J23 0680  3    enabling him to endure colossal misfortune, fear, frustration,
J23 0690  3    uncertainty, suffering, evil, and danger. Religion
J23 0700  1    usually also includes a principle of compensation,
J23 0700  8    mainly in a promised perfect future state.
J23 0710  4       The belief in immortality, where held, functions
J23 0730  2    as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the
J23 0730 12    here and now. The tensions accompanying a repressive
J23 0740  8    consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting
J23 0750  6    secret are relieved for the less self-contained or
J23 0760  4    self-sufficient by confession, repentance, and penance.
J23 0770  1    The feeling of individual inferiority, defeat, or humilation
J23 0770  9    growing out of various social situations or individual
J23 0780  8    deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion
J23 0790  6    in worship or prayer with a friendly, but all-victorious
J23 0800  4    Father-God, as well as by sympathetic fellowship with
J23 0810  2    others who share this faith, and by opportunities in
J23 0810 11    religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.
J23 0820  9       In providing for these inner individual functions,
J23 0830  6    religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of
J23 0840  5    mind and well-being services for which there is no
J23 0850  2    other institution.
J23 0850  4       In addition to the functions of religion within
J23 0870  2    man, there have always been the outer social functions
J23 0870 11    for the community and society. The two have never been
J23 0880  9    separable. Religion is vitally necessary in both societal
J23 0890  7    maintenance and regulation.
J23 0900  1       The value-system of a community or society is always
J23 0900 11    correlated with, and to a degree dependent upon, a
J23 0910  8    more or less shared system of religious beliefs and
J23 0920  3    convictions. The religion supports, re-enforces, reaffirms,
J23 0930  2    and maintains the fundamental values. Even in the united
J23 0940  1    states, with its freedom of religious belief and worship
J23 0940 10    and its vast denominational differentiation, there
J23 0950  4    is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian
J23 0960  4    values. This is demonstrated especially when there
J23 0970  1    is awareness of radically different value orientation
J23 0970  8    elsewhere; for example Americans rally to Christian
J23 0980  7    values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism. In America
J23 0990  6    also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction
J23 1000  3    a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common
J23 1010  3    religion. Even the non-church members- the freewheelers,
J23 1030  1    marginal religionists and so on- have the values of
J23 1030 10    Christian civilization internalized in them. Furthermore,
J23 1050  5    religion tends to integrate the whole range of values
J23 1060  6    from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary
J23 1070  4    and subordinate values; for example, those regarding
J23 1080  1    material objects and pragmatic ends. Finally, it gives
J23 1080  9    sanctity, more than human legitimacy, and even, through
J23 1090  8    super-empirical reference, transcendent and supernatural
J23 1100  4    importance to some values; for example, marriage as
J23 1110  3    a sacrament, much law-breaking as sinful, occasionally
J23 1120  1    the state as a divine instrument. It places certain
J23 1120 10    values at least beyond questioning and tampering.
J23 1130  5       Closely related to this function is the fact that
J23 1140  6    the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends
J23 1160  2    for the society, which are compatible with the supreme
J23 1160 11    eternal ends. This something leads to a conception
J23 1170  8    of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable
J23 1180  6    in terms of ultimate ends; for example, a plan that
J23 1190  4    fulfills the will of God, which advances the Kingdom
J23 1200  1    of God, which involves social life as part of the Grand
J23 1200 12    Design. This explains some group ends and provides
J23 1210  8    a justification of their primacy. It gives social guidance
J23 1230  6    and direction and makes for programs of social action.
J23 1240  4    Finally, it gives meaning to much social endeavor,
J23 1250  1    and logic, consistency, and meaning to life. In general,
J23 1250 10    there is no society so secularized as to be completely
J23 1260  8    without religiously inspired transcendental ends.
J23 1270  3       Religion integrates and unifies. Some of the oldest,
J23 1280  4    most persistent, and most cohesive forms of social
J23 1280 12    groupings have grown out of religion. These groups
J23 1290  8    have varied widely from mere families, primitive, totemic
J23 1300  5    groups, and small modern cults and sects, to the memberships
J23 1310  5    of great denominations, and great, widely dispersed
J23 1320  2    world religions. Religion fosters group life in various
J23 1320 10    ways. The common ultimate values, ends and goals fostered
J23 1330  9    by religion are a most important factor. Without a
J23 1340  7    system of values there can be no society. Where such
J23 1350  4    a value system prevails, it always unifies all who
J23 1360  2    possess it; it enables members of the society to operate
J23 1360 12    as a system. The beliefs of a religion also reflecting
J23 1380  8    the values are expressed in creeds, dogmas, and doctrines,
J23 1390  6    and form what Durkheim calls a credo. As he points
J23 1400  4    out, a religious group cannot exist without a collective
J23 1410  1    credo, and the more extensive the credo, the more unified
J23 1410 11    and strong is the group. The credo unifies and socializes
J23 1420  9    men by attaching them completely to an identical body
J23 1430  7    of doctrine; the more extensive and firm the body of
J23 1440  6    doctrine, the firmer the group.
J23 1440 11       The religious symbolism, and especially the closely
J23 1450  6    related rites and worship forms, constitute a powerful
J23 1460  5    bond for the members of the particular faith. The religion,
J23 1470  3    in fact, is an expression of the unity of the group,
J23 1480  1    small or large. The common codes, for religious action
J23 1480 10    as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral
J23 1490  8    behavior, bind the devotees together. These are ways
J23 1500  5    of jointly participating in significantly symbolized,
J23 1510  2    standardized, and ordered religiously sanctified behavior.
J23 1520  1    The codes are mechanism for training in, and directing
J23 1520 10    and enforcing, uniform social interaction, and for
J23 1530  6    continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity
J23 1540  3    of the group.
J23 1540  6       Durkheim noted long ago that religion as "... a
J23 1550  5    unified system of beliefs and practices relative to
J23 1560  2    sacred things ... unite[s] into one single moral community
J23 1560 11    ... all those who adhere to them". His view is that
J23 1580 10    every religion pertains to a community, and, conversely,
J23 1600  5    every community is in one aspect a religious unit.
J23 1610  2    This is brought out in the common religious ethos that
J23 1610 12    prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences
J23 1620  7    at many secular semi-public and public occasions in
J23 1630  7    the United States; and it is evidenced in the prayers
J23 1650  5    offered, in the frequent religious allusions, and in
J23 1660  3    the confirmation of points on religious grounds.
J23 1660 10       The unifying effect of religion is also brought
J23 1670  8    out in the fact that historically peoples have clung
J23 1680  4    together as more or less cohesive cultural units, with
J23 1690  3    religion as the dominant bond, even though spatially
J23 1690 11    dispersed and not politically organized. The Jews for
J23 1700  8    2500 years have been a prime example, though the adherents
J23 1710  7    of any world or interpeople religion are cases in point.
J23 1720  5    it might be pointed out that the integrating function
J23 1730  2    of religion, for good or ill, has often supported or
J23 1730 12    been identified with other groupings- political, nationality,
J23 1740  7    language, class, racial, sociability, even economic.
J23 1760  5       Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving
J23 1780  4    function. As such it acts as an anchor for the people.
J23 1790  4    There is a marked tendency for religions, once firmly
J23 1800  1    established, to resist change, not only in their own
J23 1800 10    doctrines and policies and practices, but also in secular
J23 1810  7    affairs having religious relevance. It has thus been
J23 1820  5    a significant factor in the conservation of social
J23 1830  2    values, though also in some measure, an obstacle to
J23 1830 11    the creation or diffusion of new ones. It tends to
J23 1840  9    support the longstanding precious sentiments, the traditional
J23 1850  4    ways of thinking, and the customary ways of living.
J23 1860  3    As Yinger has pointed out, the "... reliance on symbols,
J23 1870  1    on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation
J23 1870  9    of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with
J23 1880  7    sacred values, turns one to the past far more than
J23 1890  5    to the future". Historically, religion has also functioned
J23 1900  2    as a tremendous engine of vindication, enforcement,
J23 1900  9    sanction, and perpetuation of various other institutions.
J23 1910  7       At the same time that religion exercises a conserving
J23 1920  7    influence, it also energizes and motivates both individuals
J23 1930  5    and groups. Much of the important individual and social
J23 1940  4    action has been owing to religious incentives. The
J23 1950  1    great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent
J23 1950 10    beacon lights that lured people toward them with an
J23 1960  9    almost irresistible force, mobilizing energies and
J23 1970  4    inducing sacrifices; for example, the Crusades, mission
J23 1980  2    efforts, just wars. Much effort has been expended in
J23 1980 11    the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions
J23 1990  9    of religion. The insuperable reward systems that most
J23 2000  6    religions embody have great motivating effects. Religion
J23 2010  3    provides the most attractive rewards, either in this
J23 2020  3    world or the next, for those who not merely abide by
J23 2020 14    its norms, but who engage in good works.
J23 2030  7       Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social
J23 2040  4    control, enforcing what men should or should not do.
J23 2050  2    Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates
J23 2050  9    of religion were more binding than any of the other
J23 2060  8    controls exercised by the group; and in modern societies
J23 2070  5    such influence is still great. Religion has its own
J23 2080  3    supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time
J23 2080 11    codes of behavior for the here and now.
