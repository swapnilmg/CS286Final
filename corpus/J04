J04 0010  2    A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline
J04 0010  9    **f as a function of magnetic field and temperature
J04 0020  7    is presented. **f is paramagnetic, and electron paramagnetic
J04 0030  4    dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line
J04 0040  4    broadening. The lines are asymmetric and over the range
J04 0050  2    of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry
J04 0050 11    increases with increasing **f and decreasing T. An
J04 0060  7    isotropic resonance shift of **f to lower applied fields
J04 0070  7    indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction.
J04 0080  3    The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive
J04 0090  2    a general expression for the second moment **f of a
J04 0090 12    polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized
J04 0100  6    to **f. The theory predicts a linear dependence of
J04 0110  5    **f on **f, where |j is the experimentally determined
J04 0120  2    Curie-Weiss constant. The experimental second moment
J04 0130  1    **f conforms to the relation **f in agreement with
J04 0130 10    theory. Hence, the electron paramagnetic effects (slope)
J04 0140  5    can be separated from the nuclear effects (intercept).
J04 0150  3    The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information
J04 0160  2    on the particle shapes. The nuclear dipole effects
J04 0160 10    provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen
J04 0170  9    nuclei, but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remains
J04 0180  8    in doubt.
J04 0180 10    #INTRODUCTION#
J04 0180 11    THE magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated
J04 0200  8    nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic
J04 0210  6    resonance properties of nuclei. It is important to
J04 0220  4    consider and experimentally verify this influence since
J04 0230  1    quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly
J04 0230  7    used in investigations of structure. **f appeared to
J04 0240  6    be well suited for the study of these matters, since
J04 0250  5    it is a normal paramagnet, with three unpaired electrons
J04 0260  2    on the chromium, its crystal structure is very simple,
J04 0270  1    and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong
J04 0270 11    **f bond provides structural interest.
J04 0280  3       We first discuss the **f bond in **f. We then outline
J04 0300  3    the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles
J04 0310  1    with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent
J04 0310 11    agreement with experiment. Indeed it is possible to
J04 0320  6    separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects.
J04 0330  3    The information provided by the electron paramagnetic
J04 0340  1    effects is then discussed, and finally the nuclear
J04 0340  9    effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified
J04 0350  7    models of the **f bond in **f.
J04 0360  3    #**F BOND IN **F#
J04 0360  7    Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally
J04 0370  2    agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence
J04 0370 13    of peculiarities of packing in the solid. Moreover,
J04 0380  8    it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f
J04 0390  6    distance is reached, below which it will become symmetric.
J04 0400  3    There is ample evidence from many sources that the
J04 0410  1    **f bond in **f is symmetric. The **f distance in **f
J04 0410 12    is 2.26 A. There is evidence, though less convincing
J04 0420  7    than for **f, that the **f bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime
J04 0430  5    is symmetric. Here the **f distance is 2.44 A. A number
J04 0440  6    of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead
J04 0450  2    to the conclusion that the **f bond becomes symmetric
J04 0450 11    when the **f bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A, but
J04 0460 11    aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime
J04 0480  5    there have been no convincing reports of symmetric
J04 0490  3    **f bonds. Douglass has studied the crystal structure
J04 0500  1    of **f by x-ray diffraction. He finds the structure
J04 0500 11    contains an **f bond with the **f distance of **f.
J04 0510  8    There is, then, the possibility that this **f bond
J04 0520  4    is symmetric, although Douglass was unable to determine
J04 0530  1    its symmetry from his x-ray data.
J04 0530  8       Douglass found **f to be trigonal, Laue symmetry
J04 0540  4    **f, with **f, **f. X-ray and experimental density
J04 0550  2    showed one formula unit in the unit cell, corresponding
J04 0550 11    to a paramagnetic ion density of **f. The x-ray data
J04 0560  9    did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space
J04 0570  6    group, but a negative test for piezoelectricity led
J04 0580  2    him to assume a center of symmetry. Under this assumption
J04 0590  1    the space group must be **f and the following are the
J04 0590 12    positions of the atoms in the unit cell. **f. This
J04 0600 10    space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric.
J04 0610  5    Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements
J04 0620  3    to agree best for **f. These data lead to a structure
J04 0630  1    in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets
J04 0630 11    of O atoms. The O atoms in each sheet are close packed
J04 0640 11    and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron
J04 0650  8    of O atoms. The **f layers are stacked normal to the
J04 0660  7    [111] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly
J04 0670  5    above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer,
J04 0680  2    in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers.
J04 0680 13    The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen
J04 0690  8    bonds. A drawing of the structure is to be found in
J04 0700  7    reference 6.
J04 0700  9       The gross details of the structure appear reasonable.
J04 0710  6    The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds,
J04 0720  4    but is the same as that assumed by **f. The bond angles
J04 0730  5    and distances are all within the expected limits and
J04 0740  2    the volume per oxygen is about normal. However, the
J04 0740 11    possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves
J04 0750  9    the hydrogen atom off **f, but also allows the oxygen
J04 0760  6    atoms to become nonequivalent, with **f at **f and
J04 0770  3    **f at **f (space group **f), where **f represents
J04 0770 12    the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those
J04 0780 11    on the other side. However, any oxygen nonequivalence
J04 0790  4    would shorten either the already extremely short **f
J04 0800  3    interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded
J04 0810  1    **f interlayer interactions which are already quite
J04 0810  8    short at 2.58 A. Hence it is difficult to conceive
J04 0820  8    of a packing of the atoms in this material in which
J04 0830  5    the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence.
J04 0840  1    The only effect of lack of a center would then be to
J04 0840 13    release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general, rather
J04 0850  8    than special, positions along the [111] axis.
J04 0860  5       If the **f bond is linear then there are three reasonable
J04 0870  4    positions for the hydrogen atoms: (1) The hydrogen
J04 0880  1    atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway
J04 0880 12    between the oxygen sheets; (2) all hydrogen atoms lie
J04 0890  8    on a sheet, but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet
J04 0900  7    than to the other; (3) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically
J04 0910  3    placed, either randomly or in an ordered way, so that
J04 0920  2    some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen
J04 0920 11    atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms.
J04 0930  8    Position (2) appears to us to be unlikely in view of
J04 0940  7    the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general
J04 0950  2    chemical structural grounds. A randomization of "ups"
J04 0950  9    and "downs" is more likely than ordered "ups" and "downs"
J04 0960 10    in position (3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated
J04 0970 10    and so the position of one could hardly affect the
J04 0980  8    position of another, and also since ordered "up" and
J04 0990  5    "down" implies a larger unit cell, for which no evidence
J04 1000  4    exists. Therefore, the only unknown structural feature
J04 1010  1    would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located
J04 1010 11    symmetrically (1) or asymmetrically (3).
J04 1020  5    #EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES#
J04 1030  1    _SAMPLES_
J04 1030  1       Douglass prepared his sample of **f by thermal decomposition
J04 1030 10    of aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`C. Dr. Douglass
J04 1040  9    was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material.
J04 1050 10    This material proved to be unsatisfactory, since we
J04 1060  6    could not obtain reproducible results on various portions
J04 1070  3    of the sample. Subsequently, we learned from Douglass
J04 1080  1    that his sample contained a few percent **f impurity.
J04 1080 10    Since **f is ferromagnetic, we felt that any results
J04 1090  8    obtained from the magnetically contaminated **f would
J04 1100  4    be suspect.
J04 1100  6       Plane suggested another preparation of **f which
J04 1110  5    we used here. 500 ml of 1M aqueous **f with 1 g
J04 1120  4    **f added are heated in a bomb at 170`C for 48 hours.
J04 1130  1    A very fine, gray solid (about 15 g) is formed, water-washed
J04 1140  1    by centrifugation, and dried at 110`C.
J04 1140  7       Differential thermal analysis showed a very small
J04 1150  6    endothermic reaction at 340`C and a large endothermic
J04 1160  4    reaction at 470`C. This latter reaction is in accord
J04 1170  3    with the reported decomposition of **f. Thermogravimetric
J04 1170 10    analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337`C
J04 1180 10    and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463`C. The expected
J04 1200  9    weight loss for **f going to **f and **f is 10.6%.
J04 1210  9    Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating
J04 1220  5    to 410`C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor.
J04 1230  4    The small reaction occurring at 337`C is probably
J04 1240  1    caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates, and perhaps
J04 1240  9    by a small amount of some hydrous material other than
J04 1250  8    **f. All subsequent measurements were made on material
J04 1260  5    which had been heated to 375`C for one hour. Emission
J04 1270  4    spectra indicated **f calcium and all other impurities
J04 1280  1    much lower. Chromium analysis gave 58.8% Cr as compared
J04 1300  1    with 61.2% theory. However, **f adsorbs water from
J04 1300  9    the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium
J04 1310  8    analysis and high total weight loss.
J04 1320  2       The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material, taken
J04 1320 11    with CuK|a radiation, indicated the presence of no
J04 1330  8    extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern
J04 1340  8    of Douglass. Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer
J04 1350  5    of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities.
J04 1360  2    **f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired
J04 1370  1    electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility
J04 1370  9    of **f, where **f. For exactly three unpaired electrons
J04 1380  8    the coefficient would be 3.10. An infrared spectrum,
J04 1390  6    obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory,
J04 1400  7    showed bands in the positions found by Jones.
J04 1410  4       Electron microscopic examination of the **f sample
J04 1420  2    showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles
J04 1420 11    about 0.3|m in diameter. The particles appeared rough
J04 1430  7    and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller
J04 1440  4    than this. The x-ray data are consistent with particle
J04 1450  3    sizes of 1000 A or greater. We found no obvious effects
J04 1460  2    due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in
J04 1460 10    this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of
J04 1470 10    the shape found from electron microscopic examination.
J04 1480  3    #NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) MEASUREMENTS#
J04 1500  1    The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing
J04 1510  1    a Varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the
J04 1510 10    associated 12-inch electromagnet system. One measurement
J04 1520  5    at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model **f
J04 1530  6    unit. A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10-16
J04 1540  6    Mc/sec range. The rf power level was maintained small
J04 1550  2    enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions
J04 1560  1    by saturation effects. A modulation frequency of 40
J04 1560  9    cps with an amplitude as small as possible, commensurate
J04 1570  7    with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality, was used.
J04 1580  4    Background spectra were obtained in all cases. The
J04 1590  4    spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of
J04 1590 12    dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal.
J04 1600  8       A single value of the thermal relaxation time **f
J04 1610  7    at room temperature was measured by the progressive
J04 1620  4    saturation method. The value of **f estimated at 470
J04 1630  2    gauss was **f microseconds. A single measurement of
J04 1630 10    the spin-spin relaxation time **f was obtained at 10
J04 1640  8    Mc/sec by pulse methods. This measurement was obtained
J04 1650  5    by W. Blumberg of the University of California, Berkeley,
J04 1660  3    by observing the breadth of the free induction decay
J04 1670  2    signal. The value derived was 16 microseconds.
J04 1670  9       Field shifts were derived from the mean value of
J04 1680  9    the resonance line, defined as the field about which
J04 1690  6    the first moment is zero.
J04 1690 11       Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical
J04 1700  8    integration. Corrections were applied for modulation
J04 1710  5    broadening, apparatus background, and field shift.
J04 1720  3       Spectra were obtained over the temperature range
J04 1730  1    of 77-294`K. For the low-temperature measurements the
J04 1730 10    sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method
J04 1750  8    similar to that of Andrew and Eades. The temperature
J04 1760  4    was maintained to within about **f for the period of
J04 1770  3    time required to make the measurement (usually about
J04 1770 11    one hour). One sample, which had been exposed to the
J04 1780  9    atmosphere after evacuation at 375`C, showed the presence
J04 1790  6    of adsorbed water (about 0.3 wt %) as evidenced by
J04 1800  6    a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room
J04 1810  3    temperature and which disappeared, due to broadening,
J04 1810 10    at low temperature. The data reported here are either
J04 1820  8    from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance
J04 1830  5    could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples
J04 1840  3    evacuated and sealed off at 375`C which contain no
J04 1850  1    adsorbed water.
J04 1850  3       The measured powder density of the **f used here
J04 1860  2    was about **f, approximately one-third that of the
J04 1860 11    crystal density (**f). Such a density corresponds to
J04 1870  7    a paramagnetic ion density of about **f.
J04 1880  3       Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having
J04 1900  1    the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter
J04 1900 13    ratio of 4:1. The top of the sample was nearly flat
J04 1910 11    and the bottom hemispherical. Spectra were also obtained
J04 1920  5    from a sample in a spherical container which was made
J04 1930  4    by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass
J04 1940  1    tube. The bubble was filled to the top and special
J04 1940 11    precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining
J04 1950  8    in the capillary. Spectra were also obtained from a
J04 1960  6    third sample of **f which had been diluted to three
J04 1970  3    times its original volume with powdered, anhydrous
J04 1970 10    alundum (**f). This sample was contained in a cylindrical
J04 1980  9    container similar to that described above.
