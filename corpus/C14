C14 0010  1       Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday
C14 0010  7    night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have
C14 0020 10    to register any complaints. Still a demurrer or two
C14 0030  6    must be entered.
C14 0030  9       Schwarzkopf is, of course, Schwarzkopf. For style
C14 0040  6    and assurance, for a supreme and regal bearing there
C14 0050  4    is still no one who can touch her. If the voice is
C14 0060  2    just a shade less glorious than it used to be, it is
C14 0060 14    still a beautiful instrument, controlled and flexible.
C14 0070  5    Put to the service of lieder of Schubert, Brahms, Strauss
C14 0080  5    and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way, it made its
C14 0090  5    effect with ease and precision.
C14 0090 10       But what has been happening recently might be described
C14 0100  7    as creeping mannerism. Instead of her old confidence
C14 0110  5    in the simplest, purest, most moving musical expression,
C14 0120  2    Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the
C14 0120 11    classic sin of artistic pride- that subtle vanity that
C14 0130  9    sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that
C14 0140  7    he or she can somehow better the music by bringing
C14 0150  4    to it something extra, some personal dramatic touch
C14 0160  1    imposed from the outside.
C14 0160  5       The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable. Clever
C14 0170  3    light songs were overly coy, tragic songs a little
C14 0180  1    too melodramatic. There was an extra pause here, a
C14 0180 10    gasp or a sigh there, here and there an extra little
C14 0190  8    twist of a word or note, all in the interest of effect.
C14 0200  5    The result was like that of a beautiful painting with
C14 0210  2    some of the highlights touched up almost to the point
C14 0210 12    of garishness.
C14 0220  1       There were stunning musical phrases too, and sometimes
C14 0230  1    the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and
C14 0230 10    communication. Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist,
C14 0240  7    John Wustman, often achieved the highest lyrical ideals
C14 0250  5    of the lieder tradition. All the more reason why there
C14 0260  4    should have been no place for the frills; Miss Schwarzkopf
C14 0270  2    is too great an artist to need them.
C14 0280  1       THE dance, dancers and dance enthusiasts (8,500
C14 0280  8    of them) had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium
C14 0290 11    on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier,
C14 0300  8    when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance
C14 0310  6    programs.
C14 0310  7       On Saturday, the orchestra was sensibly situated
C14 0320  4    down on the field, the stage floor was apparently in
C14 0330  2    decent condition for dancing, and the order of the
C14 0330 11    program improved.
C14 0340  1    #@#
C14 0340  2    There was, additionally, a bonus for the Saturday-night
C14 0350  1    patrons. Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared
C14 0350  9    in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's "Roots
C14 0360  8    of the Blues", a work given its premiere three weeks
C14 0370  8    ago at the Boston Arts Festival.
C14 0380  1       Otherwise, the program included, as on Thursday,
C14 0380  8    the Taras-Tchaikovsky "Design for Strings", the Dollar-Britten
C14 0400  1    "Divertimento", the Dollar-De Banfield "The Duel" and
C14 0410  1    the pas de deux from "The Nutcracker".
C14 0410  8       Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn, who danced the "Nutcracker"
C14 0420  8    pas de deux, were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas
C14 0430  8    de deux from "Don Quixote", another brilliant showpiece
C14 0440  4    that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.
C14 0450  1       Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening,
C14 0460  1    Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly
C14 0460  8    impressive in their roles in "The Duel", a work that
C14 0470  9    depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness
C14 0480  4    of the two principal combatants.
C14 0480  9       Mr. Ailey's "Roots of the Blues", an earthy and
C14 0490  9    very human modern dance work, provided strong contrast
C14 0500  6    to the ballet selections of the evening.
C14 0510  3    #@#
C14 0510  4    As Brother John Sellers sang five "blues" to the guitar
C14 0520  4    and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep
C14 0530  1    Shepard, Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through
C14 0530 10    volatile dances that were by turns insinuating, threatening,
C14 0540  8    contemptuous and ecstatic.
C14 0550  2       Their props were two stepladders, a chair and a
C14 0550 11    palm fan. He wore the clothes of a laborer, and she
C14 0560 11    was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress.
C14 0570  7       The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers
C14 0580  6    were exploited in leaps, lifts, crawls and slides that
C14 0590  3    were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong,
C14 0590 12    sometimes almost frightening, tensions. "Roots of the
C14 0600  7    Blues" may not be for gentle souls, but others should
C14 0610  9    welcome its super-charged impact.
C14 0630  1       "PERHAPS it is better to stay at home. The armchair
C14 0630 11    traveler preserves his illusions". This somewhat cynical
C14 0640  7    comment may be found in "Blue Skies, Brown Studies",
C14 0650  8    a collection of travel essays by William Sansom, who
C14 0660  6    would never consider staying home for long. Mr. Sansom
C14 0670  4    is English, bearded, formidably cultivated, the versatile
C14 0680  2    author of numerous volumes of short stories, of novels
C14 0680 11    and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel
C14 0690 10    articles but something midway between.
C14 0700  3       The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning,
C14 0710  3    his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance
C14 0720  1    of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell
C14 0720 10    Sitwell, Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a
C14 0730  9    dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating
C14 0740  7    a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty
C14 0750  4    (her third) and an American multimillionaire (his fourth).
C14 0760  2    The result is rather wonderful, but so rich as to be
C14 0760 13    indigestible if taken in too thick slices.
C14 0770  7       There are sixteen essays in "Blue Skies, Brown Studies".
C14 0780  6    Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and
C14 0790  5    originally appeared in various magazines. All are well
C14 0800  3    written and are overwritten. But, even if Mr. Sansom
C14 0800 12    labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning
C14 0810  9    and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits
C14 0820  7    of language allow, he still can charm and astound.
C14 0830  4    Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting
C14 0840  2    one word after another. Mr. Sansom actually writes
C14 0840 10    his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence,
C14 0850 10    with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources
C14 0860  7    of English, with a thick shower of sophisticated, cultural
C14 0870  4    references.
C14 0870  5    #A CONTEMPLATIVE CONNOISSEUR#
C14 0880  1    "I like to sniff a place, and reproduce what it really
C14 0880 12    smells and looks like, its color, its particular kind
C14 0890  9    of life". This is an exact description of what Mr.
C14 0900  7    Sansom does. He ignores guidebook facts. He only rarely
C14 0910  5    tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches
C14 0920  1    an individual or quotes his opinions. It is an over-all
C14 0920 12    impression Mr. Sansom strives for, an impression compounded
C14 0930  8    of visual details, of a savory mixture of smells, of
C14 0940  8    much loving attention to architecture and scenery,
C14 0950  3    of lights and shadows, of intangibles of atmosphere
C14 0960  1    and of echoes of the past.
C14 0960  7       William Sansom writes only about Europe in this
C14 0970  4    book and frequently of such familiar places as London,
C14 0980  1    Vienna, the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords.
C14 0980  9    But no matter what he writes about he brings to his
C14 0990 10    subject his own original mind and his own sensitive
C14 1000  6    reactions. "A writer lives, at best, in a state of
C14 1010  4    astonishment", he says. "Beneath any feeling he has
C14 1010 12    of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper
C14 1020 12    one of wonder at it all. To transmit that feeling he
C14 1030  7    writes". This may not be true of many writers, but
C14 1040  4    it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom. So in these pages
C14 1050  2    one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta
C14 1050 11    of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez;
C14 1060  7    at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands, always
C14 1070  6    much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an
C14 1080  4    American used to summers in New York or Kansas City;
C14 1090  2    at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's
C14 1100  1    finest restaurants, La Bonne Auberge, which is situated
C14 1100  9    on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport;
C14 1110  8    and at the infinite variety of London.
C14 1120  3       Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way
C14 1130  2    which recalls (to those who recall easily) the statues
C14 1130 11    of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto.
C14 1140  7    He can coin a neat phrase: "a street spattered with
C14 1150  5    an invigoration of people"; tulips with "petals wide
C14 1160  4    and shaggy as a spaniel's ears"; after a snowstorm
C14 1170  2    a landscape smelling "of woodsmoke and clarity". And,
C14 1170 10    for all his lacquered, almost Byzantine self-consciousness,
C14 1180  8    he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected
C14 1190  8    comparison.
C14 1190  9    #BEAUTY BORROWED FROM AFAR#
C14 1200  3    In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his
C14 1210  2    enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by
C14 1210 10    Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza.
C14 1220  8    How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed
C14 1230  6    its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus:
C14 1240  3       "The white colonnaded, cedar-roofed Southern mansion
C14 1250  1    is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of
C14 1250 11    grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular
C14 1260  8    part of the blue South, the Palladian orbit stretching
C14 1270  5    out from Vicenza: the old mind of Andrea Palladio still
C14 1280  4    smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern
C14 1290  4    porch, the deep friezes of his architectonic music
C14 1290 12    rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen,
C14 1300  9    his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from
C14 1310  7    a tall mint julep, his sense of columns framing the
C14 1320  3    warm velvet night has brought together a million couple
C14 1330  1    of mating lips". Nice, even if a trifle gaudy.
C14 1330 10       "Blue Skies, Brown Studies" is illustrated with
C14 1340  6    numerous excellent photographs.
C14 1360  1       IN recent days there have been extensive lamentations
C14 1360  9    over the absence of original drama on television, but
C14 1370  9    not for years have many regretted the passing of new
C14 1380  7    plays on radio. WBAI, the listener-supported outlet
C14 1390  2    on the frequency-modulation band, has decided to do
C14 1400  3    what it can to correct this aural void. Yesterday it
C14 1400 13    offered "Poised for Violence", by Jean Reavey.
C14 1410  7       WBAI is on the right track: in the sound medium
C14 1420  8    there has been excessive emphasis on music and news
C14 1430  5    and there could and should be a place for theatre,
C14 1440  1    as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations
C14 1440  8    continue to demonstrate. Unfortunately, "Poised for
C14 1450  6    Violence" was not the happiest vehicle with which to
C14 1460  7    make the point.
C14 1460 10    #@#
C14 1460 11    Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage- it is
C14 1470 10    mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall-
C14 1480  5    and, in addition, employs an avant-garde structure
C14 1490  2    that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension
C14 1500  1    is to be encouraged.
C14 1500  5       The play's device is to explore society's obsession
C14 1510  2    with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group
C14 1520  1    of artist's models who remain part of someone else's
C14 1520 10    painting rather than just be themselves. In a succession
C14 1530  9    of scenes they appear in different guises- patrons
C14 1540  5    of a cafe, performers in a circus and participants
C14 1550  2    in a family picnic- but in each instance they inevitably
C14 1560  1    put ugliness before beauty.
C14 1560  5    #@#
C14 1560  6    Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest
C14 1570  6    and aspiration of merit. But its relentless discursiveness
C14 1580  2    and determined complexity are so overwhelming that
C14 1590  1    after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins
C14 1590 11    to wilt. Moreover, her central figures are so busily
C14 1600  7    fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none
C14 1610  4    emerges as an arresting individual in his own right
C14 1620  2    or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.
C14 1620 10       But quite conceivably an altogether different impression
C14 1630  6    will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre
C14 1640  7    and there can be other effects to relieve the burden
C14 1650  3    on the author's words. Which in itself is an immediate
C14 1660  1    reward of the WBAI experiment; good radio drama has
C14 1660 10    its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration.
C14 1680  1       A WEEKLY showcase for contemporary music, from the
C14 1680  9    austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops
C14 1690  9    of electronic music, is celebrating its fourth anniversary
C14 1700  6    this month.
C14 1700  8       Titled "What's New in Music"? the enterprising program
C14 1710  7    is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station WQXR.
C14 1720  6       The brief notes introducing each work offer salient
C14 1730  6    historical or technical points, and many listeners
C14 1740  3    are probably grateful for being intelligently taken
C14 1740 10    by the hand through an often difficult maze. The show
C14 1750 10    is programed and written by the station's assistant
C14 1760  6    continuity editor, Chuck Briefer.
C14 1770  1       The first Saturday in each month is set aside for
C14 1770 11    new recordings. Last Saturday's interesting melange
C14 1780  5    included Ernst Toch, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Richard
C14 1790  4    Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new "space" opera
C14 1800  5    by the Swedish composer, Karl-Birger Blomdahl.
C14 1810  1       Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected
C14 1810 10    American composer, a particular type of music or the
C14 1820  9    music of a given country.
C14 1830  2       It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour
C14 1830 10    is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary
C14 1840  9    musical scene. But one wishes, when the appetite is
C14 1850  7    whetted, as it was in the case of the all-too-brief
C14 1860  5    excerpt from the Blomdahl opera, that further opportunity
C14 1870  1    would be provided both for hearing the works in their
C14 1870 11    entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense
C14 1880 10    and nature of the compositions.
C14 1900  1       THE Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison
C14 1900  9    Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell
C14 1910 10    performances before it brings its long American tour
C14 1920  7    to a close.
C14 1920 10       It is not simply giving a repetition of the program
C14 1930  7    it gave during its New York engagement earlier this
C14 1940  4    season, but has brought back many of the numbers that
C14 1950  2    were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and
C14 1950 14    won everybody's heart.
C14 1960  2       It is good to see those numbers again. The "Suite
C14 1970  1    of Old Russian Dances" that opened that inaugural program
C14 1980  1    with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and
C14 1980 11    built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth;
C14 1990  6    the amusing "Yurochka", in which a hard-to-please young
C14 2000  8    man is given his come-uppance; the lovely (and of course
C14 2010  5    vigorous) "Polyanka" or "The Meadow"; the three Moldavian
C14 2020  4    dances entitled "Zhok"; the sweet and funny little
C14 2030  2    dance about potato planting called "Bul'ba"; and the
C14 2040  2    hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day
C14 2040 11    called "City Quadrille" are all just as good as one
C14 2050  9    remembers them to have been, and they are welcome back.
C14 2070  1       So, for that matter, are the newer dances- the "Kalmuk
C14 2080  3    Dance" with its animal movements, that genial juggling
C14 2090  2    act by Sergei Tsvetkov called "The Platter", the rousing
C14 2100  2    and beautiful betrothal celebration called "Summer",
C14 2100  8    "The Three Shepherds" of Azerbaijan hopping up on their
C14 2110  9    staffs, and, of course, the trenchant "Rock 'n' Roll".
