G68 0010  1    From 1613 on, if the lists exist, they contain between
G68 0010 11    twenty to thirty names. As the total number of incepting
G68 0020  8    bachelors in 1629 was, according to Masson (Life, 1:218
G68 0030  5    and n), two hundred fifty-nine, the twenty-four names
G68 0040  5    listed in the ordo senioritatis for that year constitute
G68 0050  3    slightly less than one tenth of the total number of
G68 0050 13    bachelors who then incepted. There were four from St.
G68 0060  9    John's and four from Christ's, three from Pembroke,
G68 0070  7    and two from each of the colleges, Jesus, Peterhouse,
G68 0080  4    Queens', and Trinity, with Caius, Clare, King's, Magdalene,
G68 0090  4    and Sidney supplying one each in the ordo senioritatis.
G68 0100  2    The list was headed by [Henry] Hutton of St. John's
G68 0110  2    who was matriculated from St. John's at Easter, 1625.
G68 0120  2    He became a fellow of Jesus in 1629, proceeded M.A.
G68 0120 12    from Jesus in 1632, and was proctor in 1639-40. The
G68 0130 11    second name was [Edward] Kempe, matriculated from Queens'
G68 0140  5    College at Easter, 1625. He proceeded M.A. in 1632,
G68 0150  6    and B.D. in 1639, being made fellow in 1632. He was
G68 0160  6    ordained deacon 16 June and priest 22 December 1633.
G68 0170  2    The third name was [John] Ravencroft, who was admitted
G68 0180  1    to the Inner Temple in November 1631. The fourth name
G68 0180 11    was [John] Milton of Christ's College, followed by
G68 0190  7    [Richard] Manningham of Peterhouse, who matriculated
G68 0200  5    16 October 1624. Venn gave his B.A. as 1624, a mistake
G68 0210  5    for 1629. Manningham also proceeded M.A. in 1632 and
G68 0220  4    became a fellow of his college in that year. [John]
G68 0230  1    Boutflower of Christ's was twelfth in the list, coming
G68 0230 10    from Perse School under Mr. Lovering as pensioner 20
G68 0240  8    April 1625 under Mr. Alsop. The fourteenth name was
G68 0250  6    [Richard] Buckenham, written Buckman, admitted to Christ's
G68 0260  5    College under Scott 2 July 1625. The fifteenth name
G68 0270  4    was [Thomas] Baldwin, admitted to Christ's 4 March
G68 0280  3    1625 under Alsop. Christ's College was well represented
G68 0290  1    that year in the ordo, and the name highest on the
G68 0290 12    list from that college was Milton's, fourth in the
G68 0300  7    entire university. Small wonder that Milton later boasted
G68 0310  5    of how well his work had been received there, since
G68 0320  3    he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors
G68 0320 13    higher than that of any other inceptor from Christ's
G68 0330  9    of that year.
G68 0350  1       It is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements
G68 0350 10    whereby these honors lists were then made up or even
G68 0360 10    how the names that they contained assumed the order
G68 0370  5    in which we find them. The process usually began with
G68 0380  3    a tutor boasting about a boy, as Chappell had boasted
G68 0380 13    about Lightfoot, to the higher officers of the college
G68 0390  9    and university. Then the various officers of the college
G68 0400  8    might take up the case. It would, however, reach the
G68 0410  5    proctors and other officers in charge of the public-school
G68 0420  3    performances of the incepting bachelors, and the place
G68 0430  1    that any individual obtained in the lists depended
G68 0430  9    greatly on how he comported himself in the public schools
G68 0440  6    during his acts therein as he was incepting. Of course
G68 0450  4    the higher officials could add or place a name on the
G68 0460  3    list wherever they wished. Milton's name being fourth
G68 0460 11    is neither too high nor too low to be assigned to the
G68 0470 11    arbitrary action of vice-chancellor, proctor, master,
G68 0480  5    or other mighty hand. He evidently earned the place
G68 0490  4    assigned him.
G68 0490  6    #RECAPITULATION OF MILTON'S UNDERGRADUATE CAREER#
G68 0500  2    Looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four
G68 0500 12    years of Milton's undergraduate days, certain phases
G68 0510  7    of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence
G68 0520  8    to him and hence to us. Of course the principal factor
G68 0530  5    in the whole experience was the kind of education he
G68 0540  3    received. It differed from what an undergraduate receives
G68 0550  1    today from any American college or university mainly
G68 0550  9    in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared
G68 0560  9    with the loose and widely scattered information obtained
G68 0570  4    today by most of our undergraduates. Milton was required
G68 0580  3    to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge
G68 0590  1    of Latin grammar, logic-rhetoric, ethics, physics or
G68 0590  9    natural philosophy, metaphysics, and Latin, Greek,
G68 0600  5    and Hebrew. He had also sampled various special fields
G68 0610  5    of learning, being unable to miss some study of divinity,
G68 0620  4    Justinian (law), and Galen (medicine). Above all, he
G68 0630  2    had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to
G68 0630 12    a remarkable degree of artistry. He had learned to
G68 0640  8    dispute devastatingly, both formally and informally
G68 0650  3    in Latin, and according to the rules on any topic,
G68 0660  1    pro or con, drawn from almost any subject, more especially
G68 0660 11    from Aristotle's works. He could produce carefully
G68 0670  6    constructed orations, set and formal speeches, artfully
G68 0680  6    and prayerfully made by writing and rewriting with
G68 0690  3    all the aid his tutor and others could provide, and
G68 0690 13    then delivered verbatim from memory. He had also learned
G68 0700  9    to dispute extempore remarkably well, the main evidence
G68 0710  6    for which of course is the presence of his name in
G68 0720  5    the honors list of 1628/29. He also displayed the ability
G68 0730  3    to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute,
G68 0730 13    the verses, of course, to be delivered from memory.
G68 0740  9    Then we have surviving at least one instance of a poem
G68 0750  8    prepared for another in Naturam non Pati Senium, and
G68 0760  4    perhaps also the De Idea Platonica. But his greatest
G68 0770  3    achievement, in his own eyes and in the eyes of his
G68 0770 14    colleagues and teachers, was his amazing ability to
G68 0780  8    produce literary Latin pieces, and he was often called
G68 0790  7    on to do so. These were his public academic activities,
G68 0800  3    domi forisque, in the college and in the university.
G68 0810  1    And his performances attracted much attention, as the
G68 0810  9    frequency of his surviving pieces in any calendar that
G68 0820  9    may be set up for his undergraduate activities testifies.
G68 0830  4       His other activities are not so easily recovered.
G68 0840  5    His statements about sports and exercises of a physical
G68 0850  3    nature are suggestive, but inconclusive. His later
G68 0850 10    boastings of his skill with the small sword are indicative
G68 0860 10    of much time and practice devoted to the use of that
G68 0870  8    weapon. Venn and others have dealt with sports and
G68 0880  4    pastimes at Cambridge in Milton's day with not very
G68 0890  1    specific results. Milton himself, uncommunicative as
G68 0890  7    he is about his lesser and nonliterary activities,
G68 0900  6    at least gives us some evidence that he was a great
G68 0910  6    walker, under any and all conditions. His early poems
G68 0920  2    and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings
G68 0920 11    in the city and the neighboring country that may be
G68 0930  8    extended to Cambridge and its surrounding countryside.
G68 0940  3    The town itself and the "reedy Cam" he often visited,
G68 0950  3    as did all in the university. The churches, the taverns,
G68 0960  1    and the various other places of the town must have
G68 0960 11    known his figure well as he roved to and about them.
G68 0970  9    The tiny hamlet of Chesterton to the north, with the
G68 0980  6    fens and marshes lying on down the Ouse River, may
G68 0990  2    have attracted him often, as it did many other youths
G68 0990 12    of the time. The Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded
G68 1000  9    him and all other students a vantage point from which
G68 1010  7    to view the town and university of their dwelling.
G68 1020  4    The country about Cambridge is flat and not particularly
G68 1030  1    spectacular in its scenery, though it offers easy going
G68 1030 10    to the foot traveler. Ball games, especially football,
G68 1040  7    required some attention, and other organized sports
G68 1050  5    may have attracted him as participant or spectator.
G68 1060  3    He smoked, as did everybody, and imbibed the various
G68 1060 12    alcoholic beverages of that day, although his protestations
G68 1070  8    while at Cambridge and after that he was no drunkard
G68 1080  8    point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drinking
G68 1090  5    bouts of some of the undergraduates and, we must add,
G68 1100  3    of some of their elders including many of the regents
G68 1100 13    or teachers.
G68 1110  1       What manner of person does Milton appear to have
G68 1110 10    been when as an undergraduate he resided at Christ's
G68 1120  9    College? He was then a slightly built young man of
G68 1130  8    pleasing appearance, medium stature, and handsome face.
G68 1140  4    Graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had taught
G68 1150  2    him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight,
G68 1150 14    wiry frame, he cut enough of a figure to have evoked
G68 1160 11    a nickname in the college, to which he himself referred
G68 1170  6    in Prolusion VI: A quibusdam, audivi nuper Domina.
G68 1180  4    That is, if we can trust that most specious of prolusions,
G68 1190  3    packed as it is with wit and persiflage. The Domina
G68 1200  1    sounds real enough, if we could only trust the conditions
G68 1200 11    under which we learn of its use; but anyone who would
G68 1210 11    put much trust in any phase of Prolusion VI except
G68 1220  6    its illusive allusiveness deserves whatever fate may
G68 1230  4    be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously stilted
G68 1240  2    banter. In short, the traditional epithet for Milton
G68 1240 10    of 'Lady of Christ's', while eminently fitting, rests
G68 1250  7    only on this baffling passage in the midst of the most
G68 1260  9    treacherous piece of writing Milton left us. Aubrey's
G68 1270  5    mention of it (2:67, and Bodleian MS Aubr. 8, f. 63)
G68 1280  5    comes from this prolusion, through Christopher Milton
G68 1290  2    or Edward Phillips. It is not a question of truth or
G68 1290 13    falsity; the prolusion in which the autobiographic
G68 1300  7    statement about the epithet occurs is such a mass of
G68 1310  8    intentionally buried allusions that almost nothing
G68 1320  3    in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false.
G68 1330  1    The entire exercise, Latin and English, is most suggestive
G68 1330 10    of the kind of person Milton had become at Christ's
G68 1340  9    during his undergraduate career; the mere fact that
G68 1350  6    he was selected, though as a substitute, to act as
G68 1360  4    interlocutor or moderator for it, or perhaps we should
G68 1360 13    say with Buck as 'father of the act', is in itself
G68 1370 11    a difficult phase of his development to grasp. Milton
G68 1380  7    was to act as the archfool, the supreme wit, the lightly
G68 1390  5    bantering pater, Pater Liber, who could at once trip
G68 1400  4    lightly over that which deserved such treatment, or
G68 1400 12    could at will annihilate the common enemies of the
G68 1410  9    college gathering, and with words alone. From an exercise
G68 1420  7    involving merely raucous, rough-and-tumble comedy,
G68 1430  2    in his hands the performance turned into a revel of
G68 1440  1    wit and word play, indecent at times, but always learned,
G68 1440 11    pointed, and carefully aimed at some individuals present,
G68 1450  7    and at the whole assembly. To do this successfully
G68 1460  5    required great skill and a special talent for both
G68 1470  3    solemn and ribald raillery, a talent not bestowed on
G68 1470 12    many persons, but one with which Milton was marked
G68 1480  8    as being endowed and in which, at least in this performance,
G68 1490  6    he obviously reveled. It may be thought unfortunate
G68 1500  2    that he was called on entirely by accident to perform,
G68 1510  1    if again we may trust the opening of the oratio, for
G68 1510 12    it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar
G68 1520 11    form of witty word play that even in this Latin banter
G68 1530  7    has in it the unmistakable element of viciousness and
G68 1540  3    an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an
G68 1550  1    adversary. But the real beginnings of this development
G68 1550  9    in him go back to the opposing of grammar school, and
G68 1560  8    probably if it had not been this occasion and these
G68 1570  4    Latin lines it would have been some others, such as
G68 1580  2    the first prolusion, that set off this streak in him
G68 1580 12    of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy.
G68 1590  8    All western Europe would hear and listen to him in
G68 1600  6    this same vein about the middle of the century.
G68 1610  1       But these prolusions that we have surviving from
G68 1610  9    the Christ's College days are only one phase of his
G68 1620  9    existence then. Perhaps his most important private
G68 1630  5    activity was the combination of reading, discussion
G68 1640  2    with a few- if we can trust his writings to Diodati
G68 1640 13    and the younger Gill, very few- congenial companions.
G68 1650  8    Lines 23-36 of Lycidas later point to a friendship
G68 1660  6    with Edward King, who entered Christ's College 9 June
G68 1670  5    1626. No other names among the young men in residence
G68 1680  3    at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton
G68 1690  1    as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted.
G68 1690 12    But that scarcely means that he was the aloof, forbidding
G68 1700  8    type of student who shared few if any activities with
G68 1710  6    his fellows, the banter of the surviving prolusions
G68 1720  2    providing enough evidence to deny this. Apparently
G68 1720  9    he was not a participant in the college or university
G68 1730  9    theatricals, which he once attacked as utterly unworthy
G68 1740  6    performances (see Apology, 3:300); but even in that
G68 1750  5    famous passage, Milton was aiming not at the theatricals
G68 1760  2    as such but at their performance by 'persons either
G68 1760 11    enter'd, or presently to enter into the ministry'.
G68 1770  8    The fact that he nowhere mentioned theatrical performances
G68 1780  5    as part of the activities of the boys later in his
G68 1790  6    hypothetical academy (1644) should not be taken too
G68 1800  2    seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew
G68 1800 11    such performances. Perhaps, in that short piece or
G68 1810  7    letter written to Hartlib in which he sketched his
G68 1820  5    scheme for educating young men, he merely overlooked
G68 1830  1    that phase of their exercises.
