D11 0010  1    When they say that under no circumstances would it
D11 0010 10    ever be right to "permit" the termination of the human
D11 0020  6    race by human action, because there could not possibly
D11 0030  5    be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a
D11 0040  3    thing, they know exactly what they mean. Of course,
D11 0040 12    in prudential calculation, in balancing the good directly
D11 0050  7    intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly
D11 0060  6    done, no greater precision can be forthcoming than
D11 0070  4    the subject allows. Yet it seems clear that there can
D11 0080  2    be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently
D11 0080 11    grave, to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's
D11 0090  9    own action.
D11 0100  1       I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows
D11 0100  9    what he means by "permit". He is not talking in the
D11 0110  7    main about probabilities, risks and danger in general.
D11 0120  5    He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously
D11 0130  1    does an evil thing (and is known certainly and unavoidably
D11 0140  1    to lead to this evil result) as it efficaciously does
D11 0140 11    some good. He is talking about double effects, of which
D11 0150  8    the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly
D11 0160  6    the other, but causes both; of which one is deliberately
D11 0170  6    willed or intended and the other not intended or not
D11 0180  3    directly intended, but still both are done, while the
D11 0190  1    evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part
D11 0190 10    of the agent, foreknown to be among the consequences.
D11 0200  6    This is what, in a technical sense, to "only permit"
D11 0210  4    an evil result means. It means to do it and to know
D11 0220  4    one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain
D11 0220 15    effect of the good one primarily does and intends.
D11 0230  9    Of course, grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military
D11 0240  7    action of any nation, or to the action of any leader
D11 0250  4    or leaders, which for any supposed good "permits",
D11 0260  1    in this sense, the termination of the human race by
D11 0260 11    human action. Certainly, in analyzing an action which
D11 0270  7    truly faced such alternatives, "it is never possible
D11 0280  5    that no world would be preferable to some worlds, and
D11 0290  4    there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction
D11 0300  2    of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative".
D11 0310  1       Naturally, where one or the other of the effects
D11 0310 10    of an action is uncertain, this has to be taken into
D11 0320  9    account. Especially is this true when, because the
D11 0330  5    good effect is remote and speculative while the evil
D11 0340  3    is certain and grave, the action is prohibited. Presumably,
D11 0350  1    if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more
D11 0350 13    certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming,
D11 0360  7    not only must the good and the evil be prudentially
D11 0370  4    weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation
D11 0380  1    of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty
D11 0380 10    or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken
D11 0390 10    into account. There must not only be greater good than
D11 0400  7    evil objectively in view, but also greater probability
D11 0410  2    of actually doing more good than harm. If an evil which
D11 0420  1    is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be
D11 0420 10    compensated for by a problematic, speculative, future
D11 0430  6    good, by the same token not every present, certain,
D11 0440  3    and immediate good (or lesser evil) that may have to
D11 0450  2    be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative,
D11 0450 11    and future evil. Nevertheless, according to the traditional
D11 0460  7    theory, a man begins in the midst of action and he
D11 0470  8    analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences before
D11 0480  2    or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.
D11 0490  1    He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the
D11 0490 13    future consequences of his action. Above all, he does
D11 0500  8    not debate mere contingencies, and therefore, if these
D11 0510  5    are possibly dreadful, find himself forced into inaction.
D11 0520  3    He does what he can and may and must, without regarding
D11 0530  1    himself as lord of the future or, on the other hand,
D11 0530 12    as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences
D11 0540  7    or by results he did not "permit" in the sense explained.
D11 0550  6    By contrast, a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins
D11 0560  3    with the contingencies and the probabilities, and not
D11 0570  2    with the moral nature of the action to be done; and
D11 0570 13    by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever
D11 0580  6    may conceivably or possibly or probably result, whether
D11 0590  5    by anyone's doing or by accident, it finds itself driven
D11 0600  5    to inaction, to non-political action in politics and
D11 0610  2    non-military action in military affairs, and to the
D11 0610 11    not very surprising discovery that there are now no
D11 0620  7    distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly
D11 0630  5    be based.
D11 0630  7       Mr. Philip Toynbee writes, for example, that "in
D11 0640  6    terms of probability it is surely as likely as not
D11 0650  4    that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the
D11 0650 14    near future if the present situation continues. If
D11 0660  8    it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical
D11 0670  6    certainty that a mistake will be made and that the
D11 0680  6    devastation will begin". Against such a termination
D11 0690  1    of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes
D11 0690 12    as an alternative that we "negotiate at once with the
D11 0700  9    Russians and get the best terms which are available",
D11 0710  6    that we deliberately "negotiate from comparative weakness".
D11 0720  4    He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically,
D11 0730  2    i.e., by considering the worst possible outcome, namely,
D11 0740  2    the total domination of the world by Russia within
D11 0740 11    a few years. This would be by far the better choice,
D11 0750 10    when "it is a question of allowing the human race to
D11 0760  7    survive, possibly under the domination of a regime
D11 0770  4    which most of us detest, or of allowing it to destroy
D11 0780  2    itself in appalling and prolonged anguish". Nevertheless,
D11 0780  9    the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere
D11 0790  8    subtly qualified: it is "a possible result, however
D11 0800  7    improbable"; "the worst, and least probable" result;
D11 0810  4    "if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given
D11 0820  4    the opportunity of prevailing"; for "surely anything
D11 0830  2    is better than a policy which allows for the possibility
D11 0840  1    of nuclear war". If we have not thought and made a
D11 0840 12    decision entirely in these terms, then we need to submit
D11 0850  9    ourselves to the following "simple test": "Have we
D11 0860  5    decided how we are to kill the other members of our
D11 0870  4    household in the event of our being less injured than
D11 0880  1    they are"? Thus, moral decision must be entirely deduced
D11 0880 10    backward from the likely eventuality; it is no longer
D11 0890  9    to be formulated in terms of the nature of present
D11 0900  6    action itself, its intention, and proximate effect
D11 0910  2    or the thing to be done.
D11 0910  8       Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee, without conscious
D11 0920  6    resort to the traditional terminology with regard to
D11 0930  4    the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the actual
D11 0940  2    context in which present moral and political decisions
D11 0940 10    must be made, by distinguishing between choosing a
D11 0950  7    great evil and choosing in danger of this evil. "It
D11 0960  6    is worse for a nation to give in to evil ... than to
D11 0970  4    run the risk of annihilation". "I am consciously prepared
D11 0980  1    to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident'
D11 0980 11    rather than accept the alternative certainty of race
D11 0990  8    slavery by design. But I can only make this choice
D11 1000  7    because I believe that the risk need not increase,
D11 1010  3    but may be deliberately reduced" [by precautions against
D11 1020  1    accidents or by limiting war?] "Quoting Mr. Kennan's
D11 1030  1    phrase that anything would be better than a policy
D11 1030 10    which led inevitably to nuclear war, he [Toynbee] says
D11 1040  7    that anything is better than a policy which allows
D11 1050  4    for the possibility of nuclear war". "If asked to choose
D11 1060  4    between a terrible probability and a more terrible
D11 1060 12    possibility, most men will choose the latter". "If
D11 1070  8    ... Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies
D11 1080  7    between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war, I
D11 1090  5    think he is right. I do not accept that the choice
D11 1100  1    is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear
D11 1100  9    war". Even Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with
D11 1110  6    his son, does so in these terms: "Compared to continuing
D11 1120  5    to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the
D11 1130  5    human race, all other evils are lesser evils ... Let
D11 1140  2    us therefore put first things first, and make sure
D11 1140 11    of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary
D11 1150  8    price may be".
D11 1160  1       Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if
D11 1160  9    he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four,
D11 1170  8    if he believed Communism was not only evil but "also
D11 1180  8    irredeemably evil", then he might "think it right to
D11 1190  7    do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist
D11 1200  5    world. Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful
D11 1210  2    to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying
D11 1210 11    the earth until doomsday". No political order or economic
D11 1220  9    system is so clearly contrary to nature. But one does
D11 1230  9    not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable
D11 1240  6    in that sense, or a static order in which no changes
D11 1250  5    will take place in time, to be able truthfully to affirm
D11 1260  2    the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted
D11 1270  1    in social institutions and social relationships except
D11 1270  8    in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed
D11 1280  8    or naked force. On their way to the Heavenly City the
D11 1290  7    children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly
D11 1300  4    city and acknowledge their share in responsibility
D11 1310  1    for its preservation. Not to repel injury and uphold
D11 1310 10    and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the
D11 1320  9    misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at
D11 1330  5    the moment, but also to start down the steep slope
D11 1340  2    along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.
D11 1340 12    Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way
D11 1350 10    to give justice social embodiment. "I would far rather
D11 1360  6    die after a Russian occupation of this country- by
D11 1370  4    some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly
D11 1380  1    by atomisation". Would such an act of refusal be useful?
D11 1380 11    He does not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically
D11 1390  9    to reject the proposition, that "if we took the risk
D11 1400  8    of surrendering, a new generation in Britain would
D11 1410  4    soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order
D11 1420  1    to reverse the consequences of that surrender". He
D11 1420  9    wants to be "brutally frank and say that these rebellions
D11 1430  8    would be hopeless- far, far more hopeless than was
D11 1440  9    the Hungarian revolution of 1956". This is not a project
D11 1450  6    for regaining the ground for limited war, by creating
D11 1460  2    a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited
D11 1470  1    weapons. It is a proposal that justice now be served
D11 1470 11    by means other than those that have ever preconditioned
D11 1480  7    the search for it, or preconditioned more positive
D11 1490  3    means for attaining it, in the past. "It is no good
D11 1500  3    recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare
D11 1500  9    with the proviso that surrender could be followed by
D11 1510  7    the effective military resistance by occupied peoples.
D11 1520  4    Hope for the future ... would lie in the natural longing
D11 1530  3    of the human race for freedom and the right to develop".
D11 1540  1    This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack
D11 1540 10    may yet be mounted, to the very last; it is to stride
D11 1550  9    along the steep slope downward. The only contrary action,
D11 1560  5    in the future as in the past, runs the risk of war;
D11 1570  4    and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any
D11 1580  1    attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular
D11 1580 10    civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional
D11 1590  6    justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger
D11 1600  5    that an effect of it will, by human action, render
D11 1610  1    this planet less habitable by the human race. That
D11 1610 10    is why it is so very important that ethical analysis
D11 1620  7    keep clear the problem of decision as to "permitted"
D11 1630  4    effects, and not draw back in fright from any conceivable
D11 1640  3    contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities
D11 1650  1    or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally
D11 1650  8    related, to what we can and may and must do as long
D11 1660 12    as human history endures.
D11 1670  1       Finally, just as no different issues are posed for
D11 1670 10    thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that
D11 1680  8    may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth,
D11 1690  7    but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination,
D11 1700  1    the same thing must be said in connection with the
D11 1700 11    question of what we may perhaps already be doing, by
D11 1710 10    human action, to accelerate this end. We should not
D11 1720  6    allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly
D11 1730  3    by our own action in the continuing human struggle
D11 1740  1    for a just endurable order of existence to blind us
D11 1740 11    to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end
D11 1750  7    of our lease may be one consequence among others of
D11 1760  4    many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not
D11 1770  2    what future.
