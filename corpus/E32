E32 0010  1    @ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance
E32 0010 10    has become the commander of others- for good or bad.
E32 0020  9    Since the Industrial Revolution, when factories emerged,
E32 0030  5    this classical pattern has been followed. Until recently.
E32 0040  4       There have always been tales of disillusionment-
E32 0050  3    the competent technician who became an administrator,
E32 0060  1    willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the
E32 0060 11    scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper
E32 0070  8    work; and much more commonly in recent years, the engineer
E32 0080  7    who found that other duties interfered with- or eliminated-
E32 0090  3    his engineering contributions. There have been many
E32 0100  4    extremely competent men who have been converted into
E32 0110  1    very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work,
E32 0110  9    to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss.
E32 0120  6       This has been more evident since our products have
E32 0130  6    incorporated astronomically increased technology. The
E32 0140  3    remedies have been many and varied- attempts to teach
E32 0150  2    management techniques- either in plant, at special
E32 0150  9    schools, or in university "crash" courses- provision
E32 0170  6    of management-trained assistants or associates. But
E32 0180  4    the realization has been growing that these are not
E32 0190  4    the complete answer. Some men have no talent for or
E32 0200  1    interest in management; forcing them into management
E32 0200  8    can only create trouble. The old shop adage still holds:
E32 0210  8    "A good mechanic is usually a bad boss".
E32 0220  4       Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition
E32 0230  1    of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor
E32 0230 10    fights to change its collar from blue to white. All
E32 0240  9    grades of management seek more resounding titles and
E32 0250  5    incomes because of social pressures. As several recent
E32 0260  2    books have over-emphasized, we have become the most
E32 0260 11    status-conscious nation in the world.
E32 0270  5       What can be done for the "individual contributor"
E32 0280  4    who is extremely important- and likely to be more so-
E32 0290  6    in the operation of the technically oriented company?
E32 0300  2    He is usually conscious of the social pressures at
E32 0300 11    home and outside; usually concerned about America's
E32 0310  6    belief that attainment and success are measured in
E32 0320  6    dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally given
E32 0330  2    only to management men, and income tends to rise with
E32 0340  1    title.
E32 0340  2       Even the college professor in America has been affected.
E32 0350  1    It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing
E32 0350 11    for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on
E32 0360 11    his technical merit as he could employing managerial
E32 0370  4    skills. This difficulty arises even though we can give
E32 0380  4    examples of men who have actually followed this course.
E32 0380 13    This leads one to conclude, as you have, that there
E32 0390 10    is inevitably more prestige in a management position
E32 0400  6    in the minds of our people".
E32 0410  1       Nobody should be more able to answer the questions
E32 0410 10    on this score than engineering vice-presidents and
E32 0420  5    chief engineers. So we asked such men in major companies
E32 0430  5    in the design field to offer their opinions on the
E32 0440  2    "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their
E32 0440 10    solutions. In the paragraphs that follow, we quote
E32 0450  8    from 32 men who are identified on the final page.
E32 0460  5    #FIRST: WHAT TITLE, WHAT SETUP?#
E32 0460 10    Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement
E32 0470  9    is that of General Electric. This is not a mutually
E32 0480  8    exclusive plan; there is no one point in a man's career
E32 0490  9    at which he must select either the technical or the
E32 0500  4    managerial path upward. Further, the management path
E32 0510  1    does not open the door to higher opportunities than
E32 0510 10    are offered by the more technical path. It is common
E32 0520  8    to shift back and forth, working up through a number
E32 0530  5    of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.
E32 0540  1       Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor
E32 0550  1    positions in both operating departments and in the
E32 0550  9    company-wide "services" operation that are filled by
E32 0560  6    men with successful managerial experience who are currently
E32 0570  5    broadening their capabilities.
E32 0570  8       Also, moving into a managerial position does not
E32 0580  8    necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical
E32 0590  5    expert. As examples at GE: Glen B. Warren, formerly
E32 0600  4    manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized
E32 0610  1    as a turbine designer. The late W. R. G. Baker, a pioneer
E32 0620  1    in television design and long-time vp + gm of the
E32 0620 12    Electronics Division, and later, by his own choice,
E32 0630  8    an individual consultant. Harold E. Strang, expert
E32 0640  5    in switchgear design, for a long period vp + gm of
E32 0650  5    the Measurements + Industrial Products Division, and
E32 0660  2    who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president
E32 0660  9    and consulting engineer in the Switchgear + Control
E32 0670  7    Division.
E32 0670  8       In the GE plan, a number of individual contributors
E32 0680  9    have positions and compensation higher than those of
E32 0690  7    many managers. These positions carry such titles as:
E32 0700  5       Consultant- Advanced Development
E32 0710  1       Consulting Engineer
E32 0710  3       Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer
E32 0720  1       Consulting Electrical Engineer
E32 0720  4       Senior Electrical Engineer
E32 0730  2       Senior Physicist
E32 0730  4       Westinghouse has a similar system, with two classifications
E32 0740  5    representing various levels of competence on the strictly
E32 0750  4    technical side: consulting engineer or scientist, as
E32 0760  2    the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist.
E32 0760 11    Many companies have systems, particularly in R + D,
E32 0770  9    which work more or less well, depending upon size and
E32 0780  8    actual belief in the policy on the part of administration,
E32 0790  5    as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations.
E32 0800  2       Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel
E32 0810  1    recognition is, as one man says it: "... that the fad
E32 0810 12    for educating top people along managerial lines is
E32 0820  7    yielding to the technically trained approach".
E32 0830  3    _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_
E32 0830  6       One company instituted, early in 1959, a vertical
E32 0840  6    classification system consisting of four levels. There
E32 0850  3    is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;
E32 0860  1    the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer,
E32 00  9    enj+oys status and pay ranging up to that for the second
E32 0870 10    level of engineering supervision. The second level,
E32 0880  4    senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level supervision.
E32 0890  2    The expectation is that first-level supervisors will
E32 0900  1    be selected in approximately equal numbers from the
E32 0900  9    second and third engineering level, with very few coming
E32 0910  7    from the first level.
E32 0920  1       The company expects to extend upward both compensation
E32 0920  9    and status for non-supervisory engineers, but probably
E32 0930  6    not into executive levels. In this organization, about
E32 0940  5    half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment
E32 0950  4    are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere. This
E32 0960  1    reflects the very heavy engineering content of the
E32 0960  9    products- which are not military. Several other examples:
E32 0980  1    _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_
E32 0980  1       "We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an
E32 0980 11    engineering department headed by a chief engineer.
E32 0990  7    We have set up a central R + D department, as well
E32 1000  6    as engineering-management departments- about 80 people
E32 1010  6    working on problems related to those of our plants.
E32 1020  1    A separate research department is, of course, confined
E32 1020  9    to new or future designs. Part of this headquarters
E32 1030  6    staff, however, are engineering managers who work between
E32 1040  5    divisional chief engineers and headquarters management.
E32 1050  2    These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president-
E32 1060  3    Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers
E32 1060  9    and chief engineers on product problems as well as
E32 1070  8    aid with design; and many are engineers who have been
E32 1080  5    advanced from the divisions. These men are considered
E32 1090  2    managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several
E32 1090 11    hats, so to speak, working with management, sales and
E32 1100  9    engineering problems related to the product.
E32 1110  5       "We do not have people in our organization termed
E32 1120  2    'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists in
E32 1130  2    one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because
E32 1130 11    we are just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'-
E32 1140 10    retired engineers retained and called in on certain
E32 1150  7    problems. The only 'fellows' in our company are those
E32 1160  6    who have been honored by ASME, AIEE or AIChE ...
E32 1170  4    I am sure that the engineer who enters management is
E32 1180  3    nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities
E32 1190  1    than he would have as a technical specialist- because
E32 1190 10    of his wider accountability".
E32 1200  1    _ANOTHER STRUCTURE_
E32 1200  3       "We have tried to make both paths attractive, so
E32 1210  4    that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction
E32 1220  1    in either. One way to formalize this is in the job
E32 1220 12    structure. We have these positions, which compare directly:
E32 1230  8    **f
E32 1230  9       "Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the
E32 1240  9    company and vice-president of Engrg, R + D. The
E32 1250  7    latter jobs include major management responsibilities
E32 1260  2    and have been filled by those who have come up primarily
E32 1270  1    through the engineering-management side ... We have
E32 1270  9    not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical
E32 1280  7    specialization comparable to our higher levels of management,
E32 1290  7    but I believe we will trend in this direction ... but
E32 1300  6    not to exceed vice-president".
E32 1310  1    _TOP JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_
E32 1310  4       "Approximately four years ago, we initiated a dual
E32 1320  4    ladder of advancement for technical persons ... The
E32 1330  1    highest position is known as a 'research scientist'.
E32 1330  9    This approach has not been entirely satisfactory. The
E32 1340  7    primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical
E32 1350  5    people themselves, and their concept of what constitutes
E32 1360  2    status in present-day society. Scientists who agitate
E32 1370  1    hardest for technical recognition are often the most
E32 1380  8    reluctant to accept it ... We have discovered that
E32 1390  7    the outward trappings such as private offices and private
E32 1400  4    secretaries are extremely important; and although we
E32 1410  2    have attempted to provide these status symbols, support
E32 1410 10    of the 'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted ...
E32 1420  9    despite the creation of a salary potential for a research
E32 1430  8    scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial
E32 1440  6    positions.
E32 1440  7       "A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder
E32 1450  5    approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities
E32 1460  3    and standards of performance for each level. With no
E32 1470  3    set standards, there is the tendency to promote to
E32 1470 12    the next highest level when the top of a salary band
E32 1480 11    is reached regardless of performance ... promotion
E32 1490  5    is too often based on longevity and time in salary
E32 1500  4    grade instead of merit. If no specific organization
E32 1510  1    plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each
E32 1510 10    salary level, the result is a department top-heavy
E32 1520  8    with high-level, high-salaried personnel".
E32 1530  1    _STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_
E32 1530  6       "We have two approaches for the technical man: the
E32 1540  6    position of staff engineer, which is rated as high
E32 1550  5    in salary as department manager; and an administrative
E32 1560  1    organization to take the routine load away from department
E32 1560 10    managers and project engineers as much as possible,
E32 1570  8    thus allowing them more time for strictly technical
E32 1580  4    work. These are only halfway measures, and the answer
E32 1590  3    will come when some way is found to allow the technical
E32 1590 14    man in industry ... to progress without limit in salary
E32 1600 10    and prestige".
E32 1610  1    _A COMPLETE PLAN_
E32 1610  4       "We have made limited application of the 'parallel
E32 1620  1    ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering
E32 1630  1    title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits
E32 1630  9    remuneration greater than the average paid to the first
E32 1640  9    level of engineering supervision (engineering section
E32 1650  4    head). We also have an 'engineering section head- research
E32 1660  4    engineer' classification which has salary possibilities
E32 1670  2    equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this
E32 1680  1    point there is no generally used parallel ladder.
E32 1680  9       "We also do a number of things to build up the prestige
E32 1690 11    of the engineer as a 'professional' and also to give
E32 1700  5    public recognition to individual technical competence.
E32 1710  2    These include encouragement of, and assistance to,
E32 1720  2    the engineer in preparation and publication of technical
E32 1720 10    papers. We have two media for publicizing individual
E32 1730  8    technical activity, a magazine widely distributed both
E32 1740  4    within and without the company, and an information
E32 1750  2    bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the
E32 1750  9    homes of all engineers. Publicity is given to the award
E32 1760 10    of patents to our egnineers and financial support is
E32 1770  7    provided for individual membership in technical societies.
E32 1780  4       "A recent, and more pertinent action, has been the
E32 1790  4    establishment of a technical staff reporting to the
E32 1800  1    vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed
E32 1800  9    by engineers chosen for their technical competence
E32 1810  6    and who have the title, member of the technical staff'.
E32 1820  5    Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first
E32 1830  4    two or three levels of management. Additional symbols
E32 1840  1    of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive
E32 1840 10    badge passes authorizing special privileges, and a
E32 1850  6    difference in the treatment of financial progress through
E32 1860  5    merit.
E32 1860  6       "We presently are involved in inaugurating a new
E32 1870  5    development center. Operations of this nature offer
E32 1880  2    the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.
E32 1880  9    All scientific staff members will have the title, 'research-staff
E32 1890  9    member'. The salary level of an individual within the
E32 1900  9    group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance
E32 1910  4    of him as an authority in his scientific field. Contrary
E32 1920  3    to usual organization-position evaluations, the position
E32 1930  3    to which research-staff members report administratively
E32 1930 10    will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff
E32 1940 10    member, therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as
E32 1950  7    highly.
E32 1950  8       "These recent steps do not offer the possibility
E32 1960  8    of extension to the great number of senior engineers
E32 1970  4    who have displayed technical competence. It is doubtful
E32 1980  3    that the complete solution to the over-all problem
E32 1980 12    can result entirely from company efforts. Fundamental
E32 1990  6    to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige
E32 2000  4    is the fact that, in the business community, prestige
E32 2010  2    and status are conferred in proportion to the authority
E32 2010 11    that one man has over others and the extent of which
E32 2020 11    he participates in the management functions".
