F26 0010  1    This should be used frequently (but shaken before using).
F26 0010 10    For galled breasts, the mother should shave into half
F26 0020  8    a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to
F26 0030  5    make a paste. This could also be used for any other
F26 0040  2    skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the
F26 0040 11    oven for a short time and then apply this under her
F26 0050 10    breasts.
F26 0050 11       "Female troubles" of various kinds do not seem to
F26 0060  9    have been common on the frontier; at least I have only
F26 0070  7    one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection,
F26 0080  4    one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer
F26 0090  1    drinks tansy tea.
F26 0090  4       Bruises, burns, cuts, etc., occurred frequently
F26 0100  1    on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers
F26 0100 10    to these problems too. Bruises and black eyes were
F26 0110  8    relieved by application of raw beefsteak. (Doctors
F26 0120  4    now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of
F26 0130  2    the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter
F26 0130 10    was another cure for bruises. Many people agreed that
F26 0150  8    burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted
F26 0160  7    butter or lard, but one informant told me that a burn
F26 0170  6    should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed watery
F26 0180  2    fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed
F26 0180 12    by bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar
F26 0190 10    baths for burns, and still another recommended salted
F26 0200  6    butter. "Butter salve" or "butter ointment" was used
F26 0210  5    for burns, and for bruises as well. This was made by
F26 0220  4    putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to
F26 0220 15    boil; when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and
F26 0230 11    bottled. Cow's milk was another cure for burns, and
F26 0240  8    burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed
F26 0250  4    quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and eyes
F26 0260  2    by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not
F26 0260 12    find a doctor at the time. A sympathetic friend made
F26 0270  8    poultices of raw potato parings, which she said was
F26 0280  5    the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat". Later
F26 0290  2    the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results
F26 0300  1    were good, but which treatment helped is still not
F26 0300 10    known.
F26 0300 11       To stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and
F26 0310  9    wounds. One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding
F26 0320  8    cut, even when on a knuckle, if it was made by a rusty
F26 0330  6    tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection.
F26 0340  2    My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy
F26 0350  1    for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly
F26 0350 10    on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton
F26 0360  8    cloth, over which she poured turpentine. He showed
F26 0370  4    me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated
F26 0380  2    and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely
F26 0380 11    a scar showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw"
F26 0390  9    of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic
F26 0400  8    and healing. Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might
F26 0410  5    be laid on the open wound without chewing. One old
F26 0420  2    man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in
F26 0420 15    the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid
F26 0430  8    back from the entire front of his head. His brother
F26 0440  4    ran a mile to get the father; when they reached the
F26 0450  2    boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the
F26 0450 13    scalp back in place, and covered the raw edges with
F26 0460  9    the slices. Then he put a rag around the dressing to
F26 0470  5    keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further
F26 0480  1    care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and
F26 0480 12    showed no scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also
F26 0490  9    used to stop bleeding, and rue was an antiseptic. Until
F26 0500  7    quite recently, "sterile" maggots could be bought to
F26 0510  5    apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface, leaving
F26 0520  2    it clean so that it could be medically treated.
F26 0520 11       Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine
F26 0530  8    over a wound. One family bound wounds with bacon or
F26 0540  6    salt pork strips, or, if these were not handy, plain
F26 0550  3    lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held
F26 0550 12    the wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were
F26 0560 10    cured or prevented by "madstones" which the pioneer
F26 0570  6    wore or carried. In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two
F26 0580  6    in Norton County, and one had been in the family for
F26 0590  3    200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck
F26 0590 12    the wounds, then cauterize them with a hot knife or
F26 0600  9    poker.
F26 0600 10       While nowadays we recognize the fact that there
F26 0610  7    are many causes for bleeding at the nose, not long
F26 0620  5    ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had
F26 0630  1    little variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused
F26 0640 10    it, a cold pack was usually first aid. This might be
F26 0650  8    applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck,
F26 0660  7    pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the nostril
F26 0670  2    (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could
F26 0670 11    be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the
F26 0680 10    patient's neck and tying in it a knot for each year
F26 0690  9    of his life. Or the victim could chew hard on a piece
F26 0700  5    of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his
F26 0710  2    ears.
F26 0710  3       Old sores could be healed by the constant application
F26 0720  1    of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood
F26 0720 12    blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing
F26 0730  7    a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous
F26 0750  4    substance. Felons were cured by taking common salt
F26 0760  2    and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing
F26 0760 13    it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine; this
F26 0770  7    mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around
F26 0780  6    the affected part. As the cloth dried, more of the
F26 0790  3    mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the
F26 0790 12    felon was supposed to be "killed".
F26 0800  5       Insect bites were cured in many ways. Many an old-timer
F26 0810  6    swore by the saliva method; "get a bite, spit on it"
F26 0820  4    was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow
F26 0830  1    clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also
F26 0830 12    for swellings; not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular.
F26 0840  9    Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where
F26 0850  7    gardens and berries thrived; so small as to be scarcely
F26 0860  6    visible to the eye, they buried themselves in the victim's
F26 0870  3    flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave
F26 0870 11    relief and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased
F26 0880 10    by applying liquid bluing. For mosquito bites a paste
F26 0890  7    of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was
F26 0900  6    made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by scraping
F26 0910  2    an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to
F26 0910 12    bathe the painful part in strong soapy water; mud was
F26 0920  9    sometimes used as well as soap. Just plain old black
F26 0930  7    dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee
F26 0940  4    stings.
F26 0940  5       Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days; to keep
F26 0950  3    them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore.
F26 0950 14    Bed slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were
F26 0960 11    placed in cups of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated
F26 0970  8    liberally with corrosive sublimate, applied with a
F26 0980  4    feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer
F26 0990  2    homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice
F26 0990 12    in their hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment,
F26 1000  9    but it did the job.
F26 1010  2       To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should
F26 1020  1    be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be
F26 1020 11    removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye.
F26 1030  9    As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected
F26 1040  3    the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder and
F26 1050  2    the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove
F26 1050 13    small objects from the eye was to have the person look
F26 1060 11    cross-eyed; the particle would then move toward the
F26 1070  6    nose, where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton.
F26 1080  5       Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, used
F26 1090  2    in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram
F26 1090 11    borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted
F26 1110  8    part on linen cloth. Itching skin, considered "just
F26 1120  4    nerves", was eased by treating with whiskey and salt.
F26 1130  4    Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider
F26 1140  1    in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To
F26 1140  9    cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a
F26 1150  8    strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in
F26 1160  4    a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning
F26 1170  1    and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands
F26 1170 11    in the same solution. Six treatments cured one case
F26 1180  7    which lasted a month and had defied other remedies.
F26 1190  5    Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands
F26 1200  3    in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one
F26 1200 14    hears that heat and hot water are used instead. Another
F26 1210  9    remedy was oil of eucalyptus, used as well for chilblains.
F26 1220  6    Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum
F26 1230  4    or cabbage leaves.
F26 1230  7       Boils have always been a source of much trouble.
F26 1240  6    A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining
F26 1250  4    rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice
F26 1260  1    was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped
F26 1260 12    in water until it formed a sticky, gummy solution.
F26 1270  8    This was also used for sores. Another frequent pioneer
F26 1280  4    difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes
F26 1290  2    and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me
F26 1290 11    she has used thin potato parings for both corns and
F26 1300  9    calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or "fire".
F26 1310  6    Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten
F26 1320  5    minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of
F26 1330  1    equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid
F26 1330 12    bandage overnight. This softened the skin so that in
F26 1340  8    the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could
F26 1350  4    be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.
F26 1360  1       There were many cures for warts. One young girl
F26 1360 10    told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger
F26 1370  8    by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days
F26 1380  5    and then painting the finger with the liquid several
F26 1390  1    times. Another wart removal method was to rub each
F26 1390 10    wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean
F26 1400 10    halves under the drip of the house for seven days.
F26 1410  5    Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep
F26 1420  2    was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this
F26 1420 10    saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was
F26 1430  9    supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few
F26 1440  5    treatments, and strangely enough many warts did just
F26 1450  2    that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a
F26 1450 15    blonde gypsy. Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar
F26 1460  9    for twenty-four hours, tie it on the wart, and wear
F26 1470  7    it for a week. A simpler method was to tie a thread
F26 1480  3    tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this
F26 1480 14    way. I know this worked. One person recommended to
F26 1490  8    me washing the wart with sulphur water; another said
F26 1500  5    it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily.
F26 1510  4    Another common method was to cut an onion in two and
F26 1520  1    place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion
F26 1520 12    was then fastened together with string and placed beneath
F26 1530  7    a dripping eave. As the onion decayed, so did the wart.
F26 1540  7       Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub; sore
F26 1550  5    feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous
F26 1560  2    herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot
F26 1560 14    water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved.
F26 1570 10    Leg cramps, one person tells me, were relieved by standing
F26 1580  7    barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and
F26 1590  6    pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I can
F26 1600  2    testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey
F26 1600 10    or brandy before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in
F26 1610  9    the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented
F26 1620  5    from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about
F26 1630  2    the patient's waist.
F26 1630  5       For sprains and swellings, one pint of cider vinegar
F26 1640  5    and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three
F26 1650  3    well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.
