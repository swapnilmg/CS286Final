D06 0010  1       I have, within the past fifty years, come out of
D06 0010 11    all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating
D06 0020  8    conviction of the Truth and about which I have not
D06 0030  5    a shadow of doubt. It has been my lot all through life
D06 0040  2    to associate with eminent scientists and at times to
D06 0040 11    discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all
D06 0050  9    questions, the nature of the hope of a life beyond
D06 0060  6    this. I have also constantly engaged in scientific
D06 0070  1    work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed
D06 0070 12    in science as well as in the religions in the world.
D06 00800    In an amateu6rish, yet in a very real sense, I have
D06 0090  7    followed the developments of archaeology, geology,
D06 0100  1    astronomy, herpetology, and mycology with a hearty
D06 0100  8    appreciation of the advances being made in these fields.
D06 0110  9       At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which
D06 0120  7    I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon
D06 0130  5    both Old and New Testaments by a "Higher Criticism"
D06 0140  2    of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a
D06 0140 14    better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for
D06 0150  8    it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props
D06 0160  8    of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.
D06 0170  1       Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a
D06 0170  9    while and, like some higher critical friends, trying
D06 0180  8    to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while
D06 0190  8    at the same time holding it to have been subjected
D06 0200  3    to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:
D06 0210  1    attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent,
D06 0210 10    Bible-loving generation and a critical, doubting,
D06 0220  6    Bible-emancipated
D06 0220  8    race. Although still aware of a great light and glow
D06 0230  9    of warmth in the Book, I stood outside shivering in
D06 0240  5    the cold.
D06 0240  7       In one thing the higher critics, like the modernists,
D06 0250  5    however, overreached themselves, in claiming that the
D06 0260  3    Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well
D06 0270  2    after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A.D.
D06 0270 12    Now, if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very
D06 0280 11    Word of God speaking through His servant, it is John's
D06 0290  7    Gospel. To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly
D06 0300  4    marvelous a book was written long after all the events
D06 0310  2    by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly
D06 0310 11    by the Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle
D06 0320 11    far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible.
D06 0330  7    Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step
D06 0340  4    out on another path, to which we might give the modern
D06 0350  1    name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works. Test it,
D06 0350 11    try it, and if it works, accept it as a guiding principle.
D06 0360 10       So, I put my Bible to the practical test of noting
D06 0370  8    what it says about itself, and then tested it to see
D06 0380  6    how it worked. As a short, possibly not the best method,
D06 0390  2    I looked up "Word" in the Concordance and noted that
D06 0400  1    the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to
D06 0400 11    be God's personal message to man. The next traditional
D06 0410  7    step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook
D06 0420  5    of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise
D06 0430  4    on any earthly "science", and I submitted to its conditions
D06 0440  3    according to Christ's invitation and promise that,
D06 0450  1    "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
D06 0450 13    doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak
D06 0460  9    of myself" (John 7:17).
D06 0470  1       The outcome of such an experiment has been in due
D06 0470 11    time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God
D06 0480  9    inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely
D06 0490  5    human book, and with it the acceptance of our Lord
D06 0500  3    Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, Son of
D06 0500 14    Man by the Virgin Mary, the Saviour of the world.
D06 0510 10       I believe, therefore, that we are without exception
D06 0520  7    sinners, by nature alienated from God, and that Jesus
D06 0530  6    Christ, the Son of God, came to earth, the representative
D06 0540  3    Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay the
D06 0550  2    penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus
D06 0550 14    receives Christ as his personal Saviour is "born again"
D06 0560  8    spiritually, with new privileges, appetites, and affections,
D06 0570  5    destined to live and grow in His likeness forever.
D06 0580  4    Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a
D06 0590  3    commendable "moral life", although such works are the
D06 0590 11    natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already
D06 0600  9    received and naturally expressing itself through such
D06 0610  5    avenues.
D06 0610  6       I now ever look for Christ acording to His promises
D06 0620  6    and those of the Old Testament as well, to appear again
D06 0630  5    in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness
D06 0640  1    over the whole earth.
D06 0640  5       To state fully what the Bible means as my daily
D06 0650  5    spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate
D06 0660  2    the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives
D06 0660 11    and friends. The Bible is as obviously and truly food
D06 0670 10    for the spirit as bread is food for the body. Again,
D06 0680  8    as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour,
D06 0690  5    I follow without question where He leads me daily by
D06 0710  3    His Spirit of love, wisdom, power and prayer. I place
D06 0710 13    His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability,
D06 0720  9    dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom
D06 0730  7    of man as folly when opposed to Him. I discern no limits
D06 0740  7    to a faith vested in God and Christ, who is the sum
D06 0750  5    of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him
D06 0760  1    even though called to stand alone before the world.
D06 0760 10       Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to
D06 0770  7    all is, "Come and see".
D06 0785  1       I STOOD at the bedside of my patient one day and
D06 0785 12    beheld a very sick man in terrible pain. As I ministered
D06 0790 11    to his needs, I noticed that his face was radiant in
D06 0800  9    spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting
D06 0810  6    not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also
D06 0820  4    the Lord.
D06 0820  6       In his heart he had that peace of which the Lord
D06 0830  3    spoke when He said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace
D06 0840  1    I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto
D06 0840 13    you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
D06 0850  9    be afraid".
D06 0860  1       What a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this
D06 0860 11    promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry
D06 0870  7    to a group of men who were very dear to Him. He was
D06 0880  6    about to leave them, to depart from this world, and
D06 0890  2    return to His Father in Heaven. Before He left them
D06 0890 12    He promised that His peace would be their portion to
D06 0900  9    abide in their hearts and minds.
D06 0910  3       I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse
D06 0910 13    who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus
D06 0920 10    Christ. It makes my work a great deal easier to be
D06 0930  9    able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering
D06 0940  3    to the physical needs of my patients.
D06 0940 10       How often have I looked to Jesus when entering the
D06 0950 10    sick room, asking for His presence and help in my professional
D06 0960  9    duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth
D06 0970  7    but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures.
D06 0980  3       Looking unto God, the Prophet Isaiah wrote these
D06 0990  2    blessed words almost three thousand years ago: "Thou
D06 0990 10    wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
D06 1000 10    on thee: because he trusteth in thee".
D06 1010  5       Are you longing for peace in your heart? Such a
D06 1020  3    calm and assuring peace can be yours. As only a member
D06 1030  1    of the family can share in the innermost joys of the
D06 1030 12    family, likewise one must belong to the family of God
D06 1040  9    in order to receive the benefits that are promised
D06 1050  4    to those who are His own.
D06 1050 10       Perhaps you are not His child. Perhaps you do not
D06 1060  8    know if you belong to Him. You may know that you are
D06 1070  6    in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are
D06 1080  3    that you belong to the family of your earthly father.
D06 1090  1       "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
D06 1090 12    Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
D06 1100  8    but have everlasting life", and "as many as received
D06 1110  6    him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
D06 1120  5    even to them that believe on his name".
D06 1130  1       It is to those who believe on His name and belong
D06 1130 12    to Him that He gives His peace; not that empty peace
D06 1140  9    the world offers, but a deep, abiding peace which nothing
D06 1150  5    can destroy.
D06 1150  7       Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ
D06 1160  7    now, accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you
D06 1170  5    with peace that only He can give.
D06 1170 12       Then, with the hymn writer of old, you can say:
D06 1180 10       "I am resting today in His wonderful peace,
D06 1190  5       Resting sweetly in Jesus' control.
D06 1200  1       I am kept from all danger by night and by day,
D06 1200 12       And His glory is flooding my soul".
D06 1215  1       SATELLITES, SPUTNIKS, ROCKETS, BALLOONS; what next?
D06 1220  4    Our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer
D06 1230  5    space, which have captured the imagination of the American
D06 1240  2    public. Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth
D06 1240  8    from the radio, television, and newspaper.
D06 1250  6       While we are filling outer space with scientific
D06 1260  5    successes, for many the "inner" space of their soul
D06 1270  4    is an aching void.
D06 1270  8       Proof? An average of 50 suicides are reported in
D06 1280  4    America each day! One out of every three or four marriages
D06 1290  3    end in divorce! Over $200,000,000 is paid yearly to
D06 1300  1    the 80,000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United
D06 1300 10    States by fearful mankind who want to "know" what the
D06 1310  8    future holds! Delinquency, juvenile and adult, is at
D06 1320  6    an all-time high! Further proof? Read your daily newspaper!
D06 1330  4       Unfortunately, in our rush to beat the Russians,
D06 1340  3    we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus
D06 1340 12    Christ: "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain
D06 1351 11    the whole world [that includes outer space], and lose
D06 1360  7    his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange
D06 1370  7    for his soul"? (Mark 8:36, 37).
D06 1380  1       Gaining outer space and losing "inner" space is
D06 1380  9    bad business according to God's standards.
D06 1390  5       It is true that we must keep up our national defenses
D06 1400  6    and scientific accomplishments; only a fool would think
D06 1410  5    otherwise. But we must not forget man's soul.
D06 1420  1       Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant
D06 1420 10    as the good news that God put His Son, Jesus Christ,
D06 1440  3    on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls?
D06 1450  6    "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
D06 1460  5    begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
D06 1470  1    not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).
D06 1470  9       Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its
D06 1480 11    weakest link. Your spiritual "inner" space helps determine
D06 1490  5    the spirituality of America as a nation. We trust you
D06 1500  7    are not one of the 70,000,000 Americans who do not
D06 1510  4    attend church, but who feel that various forms of recreation
D06 1520  1    are more important than worshipping the God who made
D06 1520 10    our country great.
D06 1530  1       Is forgiveness of past sins, assurance of present
D06 1530  9    help, and hope of future bliss in your orbit? Or are
D06 1540 10    you trying the devil's substitutes to relieve that
D06 1550  5    spiritual hunger you feel within? Pleasure, fame and
D06 1560  3    fortune, drowning your troubles with a drink, and "living
D06 1570  1    it up" with the gang are like candy bars when you're
D06 1570 12    hungry: they may ease your hunger temporarily, but
D06 1580  8    they'll never take the place of a satisfying, mouth-watering
D06 1590  7    steak.
D06 1590  8       So it is spiritually. No amount of religious ceremonies
D06 1600  6    or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of
D06 1610  5    your "inner" space. Why? Because your soul was made
D06 1620  4    to be filled with God Himself, not religious functions
D06 1630  1    "about" Him. Only He can satisfy the deepest longings.
D06 1630 10    That is why the Bible commands you to "Taste and see
D06 1640 11    that the Lord is good: blessed [happy] is the man that
D06 1650  9    trusteth in him" (Psalm 34:8).
D06 1660  3       You can receive God into your heart and life by
D06 1670  2    a step of personal faith. Accept the sinless Son of
D06 1670 12    God, Jesus Christ, as your own personal Saviour. "As
D06 1680  8    many as received him [Jesus], to them gave he power
D06 1690  7    to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
D06 1700  5    on his name"
