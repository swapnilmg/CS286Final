B19 0010  3    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0010  9       I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and
B19 0030  5    his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of
B19 0040  5    those horrible automobiles. We have now a quiet city,
B19 0050  2    fewer automobiles, less congestion, and fewer retail
B19 0050  9    customers shopping in center city. Good for Mr. Trimmer.
B19 0060  8    Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a "ghost"
B19 0070  9    town. @
B19 0070 11    #DEFENDS BIG TRUCKS#
B19 0080  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0080  7       I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it
B19 0090  5    had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete
B19 0100  3    there wouldn't be an Expressway. Without these massive
B19 0110  1    trucks highways would still be just an idea of the
B19 0110 11    future.
B19 0120  1       Mr. George Hough (Oct. 30) sounds like a business
B19 0120  9    man who waits until the last minute to leave his home
B19 0130  9    or shop. The trucks today help pay for this highway.
B19 0140  6    They try to keep within the speed limits. Although
B19 0150  2    today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars, a truck
B19 0150 12    driver has to be a sensible person and guard against
B19 0160 10    hogging the road. @
B19 0170  1    #OUT OF SCHOOL AT 14#
B19 0170  6    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0170 12       The letter writer who suggested saving money by
B19 0180  8    taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed
B19 0190  6    his letter "SIMPLETON" instead of "SIMPLICITUDE". Such
B19 0200  3    kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or
B19 0210  4    in jail where they become a much bigger burden. There
B19 0210 14    are lots of jobs available for trained high school
B19 0220  9    graduates, but not for the dropouts. What we need is
B19 0230  7    more vocational training in high schools, not more
B19 0240  3    dropouts. @
B19 0240  5    #TWO WRONGS#
B19 0250  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0250  2       I suppose I am missing some elementary point but
B19 0250 11    I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right!
B19 0260 10    I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere
B19 0270  6    tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is. Will
B19 0280  4    our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less
B19 0290  1    harmful to future generations of children? If an atom
B19 0290 10    bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the
B19 0300  8    atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to
B19 0310  6    fulfill any military objective required of it.
B19 0320  1       As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial
B19 0320 13    attack enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear
B19 0330 10    weapons we now have- at least the bombs- can inflict
B19 0340  7    all the demage that is necessary. Why do we need bigger
B19 0350  5    and better bombs? I repeat, two wrongs do not make
B19 0360  2    a right. @

B19 0400  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0400  6       To our everlasting shame, we led the world in this
B19 0410  4    nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped
B19 0410 13    the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
B19 0420  7       Having led the world in this mad race I pray that
B19 0430  8    we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of
B19 0440  4    the race.
B19 0440  6       Are we to be the master of the atom, or will the
B19 0450  3    atom be our master- and destroy us! @
B19 0450 11    #WHY TRUST JAGAN?#
B19 0460  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0460  7       Just because Cheddi Jagan, new boss of British Guiana,
B19 0470  7    was educated in the United States is no reason to think
B19 0480  6    he isn't a Red. We have quite a few home-grown specimens
B19 0490  2    of our own. If we go all gooey over this newest Castro
B19 0500  1    (until he proves he isn't) we've got rocks in our heads.
B19 0500 12    How many times must we get burned before we learn?

B19 0520  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0520  7       Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped
B19 0530  5    on Japan were to end a war not start one. The war could
B19 0540  5    have continued many years with many thousands killed
B19 0550  1    on both sides. Intelligent people will admit that bombs
B19 0550 10    and rockets of destruction are frightening whether
B19 0560  6    they fall on Japan, London or Pearl Harbor. That is
B19 0570  6    why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent
B19 0580  2    men with good intentions from all countries could meet
B19 0590  1    and solve problems without resorting to war.
B19 0590  8       Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs
B19 0600  6    in peace time to try to frighten the world. Why aren't
B19 0610  4    the Soviets expelled from the U.N.? @
B19 0620  1    #BELATED TRIBUTE#
B19 0620  3    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0620  9       While "better late than never" may have certain
B19 0630  8    merits, the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for
B19 0640  7    Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less
B19 0650  5    than a satisfactory expression of appreciation. Had
B19 0660  1    it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the
B19 0660 10    United Nations was living, unquestionably he would
B19 0670  6    have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult
B19 0680  4    and, in many ways, thankless task.
B19 0680 10       According to one report, however, Mr. Hammarskjold
B19 0690  7    was considered "too controversial" a figure to warrant
B19 0700  6    bestowal of the coveted honor last spring. Actually,
B19 0710  3    of course, that label "controversial" applied only
B19 0720  2    because he was carrying out the mandate given him by
B19 0720 12    the world organization he headed rather than following
B19 0730  7    the dictates of the Soviet Union.
B19 0740  2       At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed the
B19 0750  2    primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted
B19 0750 12    themselves to be intimidated. It is well for us to
B19 0760 10    remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone
B19 0770  5    for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.
B19 0780  1    As has happened so often in the past, the ability to
B19 0780 12    recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.

B19 0800  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0800  7       Just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President
B19 0810  5    Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for
B19 0820  4    providing a first-class example of "people to people"
B19 0830  1    good will. If only this could be done more often- with
B19 0830 12    such heartening results- many of the earth's "big problems"
B19 0840  9    would shrink to the insignificances they really are.
B19 0850  8       P. S. Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad's

B19 0860 10    #EXPRESSWAY ANSWER: EAST RIVER DRIVE#
B19 0880  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0880  1       Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill
B19 0880  7    Expressway are valuable; however, several pertinent
B19 0890  6    considerations deserve recognition.
B19 0900  1       One of the problems associated with the expressway
B19 0910  1    stems from the basic idea. We shuffle a large percentage
B19 0910 11    of the cars across the river twice. They start on the
B19 0920  9    East side of the Schuylkill, have to cross over to
B19 0930  6    the West to use the expressway and cross over again
B19 0940  2    to the East at their destination. Bridges, tunnels
B19 0940 10    and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings.
B19 0950  9    Each one of these is, by its nature, a focal point
B19 0960  8    or a point of natural congestion. We should avoid these
B19 0970  4    congestion points or, putting it another way, keep
B19 09  1    cars starting and ending on the East side of the river-
B19 0980 12    on the East side.
B19 0990  2       This can be accomplished by several logical steps:
B19 1000  1    _(1)_
B19 1000  2       Widen the East River Drive at least one lane.
B19 1010  1    _(2)_
B19 1010  1       So widen it as to minimize the present curves and
B19 1010 11    eliminate drainage problems.
B19 1020  2    _(3)_
B19 1020  3       Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead
B19 1030  1    directional lights as on our bridges. One additional
B19 1030  9    lane would then be directional with the traffic burden
B19 1040  7    and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability
B19 1050  4    of the East River Drive by fifty percent.
B19 1060  1    _(4)_
B19 1060  2       This could be accomplished without the tremendous
B19 1060  9    expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway
B19 1070  6    and without destroying the natural beauty of the East
B19 1080  7    River Drive. @
B19 1080 10    #SHADOW OVER WASHINGTON SQUARE#
B19 1090  3    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 1090  9       I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington
B19 1100  8    Square:
B19 1100  9    _1._
B19 1100 10       Take away George Washington's statue.
B19 1110  5    _2._
B19 1110  6       Replace it with the statue of one or another of
B19 1120  7    the world's famous dictators.
B19 1120 11       There's no sense in being reminded of times that
B19 1130  9    were. Washington Square seems not part of a free land.
B19 1140  7    It may remind one of Russia, China or East Berlin;
B19 1150  3    but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington
B19 1160  1    and the Continental soldiers fought for.
B19 1160  7       The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve
B19 1170  7    my two proposals, because it is responsible for the
B19 1180  5    change of ideological atmosphere in the Square. The
B19 1190  2    matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know,
B19 1190 13    but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism
B19 1200 10    ... The Commission has posted signs in Washington Square
B19 1210  7    saying:
B19 1210  8       The Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This Square.
B19 1220  9       Fairmount Park Commission
B19 1230  3       Does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government
B19 1240  3    reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers
B19 1250  1    an annoyance? If birds don't belong in a Square or
B19 1250 11    Park, what does? They are the most beautiful part of
B19 1260  9    that little piece of Nature. The trees are their homes;
B19 1270  6    but the Commission does not share such sentiments.
B19 1280  3       The whole official City apparently has an intense
B19 1290  2    hatred toward birds. Starlings and blackbirds are scared
B19 1290 10    off by cannon, from City Hall. Just a preliminary measure.
B19 1300 10    If any are left, presently, we may expect to see signs
B19 1310  9    specifically PROHIBITING the feeding of them too.
B19 1320  6       The City Government is not united in an all-out,
B19 1330  6    to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents,
B19 1340  1    thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives. Indeed no.
B19 1340  7    Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on
B19 1350  9    John and Jane Doe, lest one piece of bread be placed
B19 1360  6    undetected and one bird survive.
B19 1360 11       Of course, in this small way of forcing the people
B19 1370 10    to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures
B19 1380  5    die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to
B19 1390  4    protest and say "How come? What's your motive? WHO
B19 1400  2    wants this deed done"?- in this small way do the leaders
B19 1410  3    of a city, or of a nation, iniure the masses to watching,
B19 1420  1    or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their
B19 1420 10    fellow men.
B19 1430  1       One means to help the birds occurs to me: Let the
B19 1430 12    chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily,
B19 1440  7    discontinue any piece of music but one. Let them offer
B19 1450  6    on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been
B19 1460  3    the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn "Abide
B19 1460 13    With Me". We will know, and He will know, to whom it
B19 1470 12    is rendered, what the birds would ask: @ @
B19 1480  7    #NOT PUSH-UPS BUT STAND-UPS#
B19 1480 13    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 1490  6       There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans
B19 1500  5    are too "soft". Unfortunately, those who would remedy
B19 1510  3    our "softness" seek to do so with calisthenics. They
B19 1520  1    are working on the wrong part of our anatomy. It is
B19 1520 12    not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown
B19 1530  9    too soft. Ashamed of our wealth and power, afraid of
B19 1540  5    so-called world opinion and addicted to peace, we have
B19 1550  3    allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed
B19 1550 12    policies.
B19 1560  1       When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals
B19 1560 11    which we know to be right, when we become hard enough
B19 1570 11    to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination,
B19 1580  7    when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts
B19 1590  6    towards socialism in our own Nation, when we recognize
B19 1600  3    that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize
B19 1610  1    that concessions to Communists do not insure peace
B19 1610  9    or freedom, then, and only then will we no longer be
B19 1620  9    "soft". America doesn't need to "push-up", she needs
B19 1630  6    to stand up! @
B19 1640  1    #DISPUTES STANS COLUMN BUSINESS SCANDAL VIEWS#
B19 1650  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B19 1650  1       The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business
B19 1650  9    scandals, is fair and accurate in most respects and
B19 1660  8    his solution to the problem has some merit. However,
B19 1670  4    he states unequivocally "the scandals in business are
B19 1680  2    far less significant than the scandals in labor". I
B19 1680 11    must, in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily
B19 1690  9    because the so-called scandals in labor unions were
B19 1700  6    very much connected with business scandals.
B19 1710  1       The area most prominently commented on during the
B19 1710  9    McClellan hearings had to do with "sweetheart contracts".
B19 1720  8    These arrangements would have been impossible if the
B19 1730  7    business community was truly interested in the welfare
B19 1740  5    of its employes. A sweetheart arrangement can come
B19 1750  3    about as often by employers doing the corrupting as
B19 1750 12    by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute. Anyone
B19 1760  6    familiar with the details of the McClellan hearings
B19 1770  5    must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements
B19 1780  2    augmented employer profits far more than they augmented
B19 1790  1    the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.
B19 1790  8       Further, it should be recalled that some very definite
B19 1800  8    steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in
B19 1810  5    the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin
B19 1820  3    Act.
